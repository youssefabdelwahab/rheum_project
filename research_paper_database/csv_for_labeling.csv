Usually made of nylon and elastane (i.e. Lycra¬Æ), these arthritis gloves apply pressure with the aims of relieving hand pain, stiffness and improving hand function. However, a systematic review identified little evidence supporting their use. We therefore designed a trial to compare the effectiveness of the commonest type of arthritis glove provided in the United Kingdom (Isotoner gloves) (intervention) with placebo (control) gloves (i.e. larger arthritis gloves providing similar warmth to the intervention gloves but minimal pressure only) in people with these conditions.
METHODS: participants aged 18¬†years and over with RA or IA and persistent hand pain will be recruited from National Health Service Trusts in the United Kingdom. Following consent, participants will complete a questionnaire booklet, then be randomly allocated to receive intervention or placebo arthritis gloves. Within three weeks, they will be fitted with the allocated gloves by clinical specialist rheumatology occupational therapists. Twelve weeks (i.e. the primary endpoint) after completing the baseline questionnaire, participants will complete a second questionnaire, including the same measures plus additional questions to explore adherence, benefits and problems with glove-wear. A sub-sample of participants from each group will be interviewed at the end of their participation to explore their views of the gloves received. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, compared to placebo gloves, will be evaluated over 12¬†weeks. The primary outcome measure is hand pain during activity. Qualitative interviews will be thematically analysed.
DISCUSSION: this study will evaluate the commonest type of arthritis glove (Isotoner) provided in the NHS (i.e. the intervention) compared to a placebo glove. The results will help occupational therapists, occupational therapy services and people with arthritis make informed choices as to the value of arthritis gloves. If effective, arthritis gloves should become more widely available in the NHS to help people with RA and IA manage hand symptoms and improve performance of daily activities, work and leisure. If not, services can determine whether to cease supplying these to reduce service costs.

A bioequivalence (BE) study (NCT02678988) evaluated availability of TCZ via Autoinjector (AI) vs. PFS. A Real-Life Human Factors (RLHF; NCT02682823) study evaluated users' ability to administer TCZ via the AI. METHODS: BE study: 165 healthy volunteers received two doses of TCZ in a randomized, crossover fashion with a 6-week washout. TCZ concentrations were analyzed for 42 days postdose. The ratios of the LS geo means for PK parameters were compared with equivalence bounds of 0.80-1.25. Secondary outcomes included safety and tolerability. RLHF study: three groups of pts with RA: self-injecting pts (n=18), pts receiving injections from nonprofessional caregivers (n=17) and pts receiving injections from healthcare professionals (n=19). At each of three visits pts received TCZ via AI. User training occurred at baseline for SIPs and CGs. Primary outcomes were % of users who correctly performed all essential tasks at visits two and three. Secondary outcomes included safety, pain, leakback, user and pt satisfaction. RESULTS: BE study: AI vs. PFS were bioequivalent Cmax50.93-1.05, and AUClst 50.94-1.07. The safety profile was comparable and injection-site pain minimal with both devices. RLHF study: users achieved an overall success rate of 92.3 and 98.1% at visits two and three, respectively. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 11 pts (20.4%). Injection-site pain was tolerable and no severe pain was reported. No deaths or serious AEs occurred. CONCLUSION: the AI was found to be bioequivalent to PFS. Intended users of the AI were successful in performing the tasks required to administer doses of TCZ. No new safety signals were observed with TCZ in either the RLHF or BE study"
9257342,,10.3899/jrheum.121103,"OBJECTIVE: to compare the interobserver reliability of three-dimensional (3D) volumetric ultrasonography (US) and 2D real-time US in detecting inflammatory and destructive changes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) wrist and hand.
METHODS: two RA patients were selected by a rheumatologist who performed independently a grey-scale and power Doppler (PD) volumetric acquisition at three anatomic sites in their more symptomatic wrist/hand using two identical scanners equipped with 3D volumetric probe. Twelve rheumatologists expert in MSUS were randomly assigned to a US scanner and a patient. In the first part of the study, each group of experts blindly, independently, and consecutively performed a 2D real-time grey-scale and PD US investigation of inflammatory changes and/or bone erosions at the three anatomic sites. In the second part of the study, each group of investigators blindly evaluated the same pathologic changes in the 6 volumes from the patient not scanned by them.
RESULTS: the kappa values were higher for 3D volumetric US than for 2D US in the detection of synovitis/tenosyno-vitis (0.41 vs. 0.37) and PD signal (0.82 vs 0.45) and in the PD signal grading (0.81 vs. 0.55).
CONCLUSION: 3D volumetric US may improve the interobserver reliability in RA multicentre studies."

Methods: the Abatacept Comparison of sub[QU]cutaneous versus intravenous in Inadequate Responders to methotrexatE (ACQUIRE) phase IIIb, randomized, double-dummy, multinational trial compared efficacy and safety of SC and intravenous (IV) ABA in patients with RA. In the initial 6-month double-blind (DB) period, patients received IV or SC ABA, plus MTX, and in the subsequent open-label longterm extension (LTE) period, all patients received SC ABA (125 mg/wk). The final 5-year safety, tolerability, and efficacy analyses are reported. Results: of 1385 patients who completed the DB period, 1372 entered LTE and 945 (68.8%) completed >= 5 years of treatment. During LTE, 97 (7.1%) patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event (AE). Incidence rate (IR; event/100 patient-yrs of exposure; based on LTE data, 95% CI) for AE of interest were the following: serious AE 7.73 (6.96-8.58), infection 38.60 (36.24-41.12), serious infection 1.68 (1.35-2.07), malignancies 1.09 (0.84-1.42), and autoimmune disorders 1.33 (1.05-1.69), and were stable over time. No association between immunogenicity and either worsening of ABA safety or loss of efficacy was noted. Efficacy in the LTE was consistent with the DB period and was maintained to the end of the study. Conclusion: these 5-year data establish that SC ABA (125 mg/wk) has a consistent safety profile and durable efficacy for longterm treatment of patients with RA who had an inadequate response to MTX.

METHODS: The phase III, multinational Abatacept Comparison of Sub[QU]cutaneous Versus Intravenous in Inadequate Responders to MethotrexatE (ACQUIRE) trial comprised a 6-month, randomized, double-blind (DB) period, in which patients received intravenous (IV) or SC ABA, plus MTX, followed by an open-label, longterm extension (LTE), in which patients received SC ABA, 125 mg/week. Safety and efficacy from the LTE (‚Äö√†¬∫3.5 yrs of exposure) are reported.
RESULTS: Patients who completed the DB period (1372/1385, 99.1%) entered the LTE; 1134 patients (82.7%) kept taking the treatment at time of reporting. Mean (SD) was 31.9 months (6.8); median (range) exposure was 33.0 (8-44) months. Patients entering the LTE had longstanding, moderate-to-severe disease [mean 7.6 (7.9) yrs and DAS28 (C-reactive protein) 6.2 (0.9)]. Incidence rates (events/100 patient-yrs) were reported for serious adverse events (8.76, 95% CI 7.71, 9.95), infections (44.80, 95% CI 41.76, 48.01), serious infections (1.72, 95% CI 1.30, 2.27), malignancies (1.19, 95% CI 0.86, 1.66), and autoimmune events (1.31, 95% CI 0.95, 1.79). Twenty-seven patients (2%) experienced injection-site reactions; all except 1 were mild. American College of Rheumatology 20, 50, and 70 responses achieved during the DB period were maintained through the LTE, and on Day 981 were 80.2% (95% CI 77.2, 83.2), 63.5% (95% CI 58.2, 68.9), and 39.5% (95% CI 34.0, 44.9) for patients who kept taking SC ABA, and 80.0% (95% CI 77.0, 83.0), 63.2% (95% CI 57.8, 68.7), and 39.2% (95% CI 33.7, 44.7) for those who switched from IV to SC ABA.
CONCLUSION: These findings support SC ABA as a well-tolerated and efficacious longterm treatment for patients with RA and inadequate response to MTX (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00559585)."

METHODS: In this phase IIIb double-blind, double-dummy, 6-month study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inadequate responses to methotrexate were randomized to receive 125 mg SC abatacept on days 1 and 8 and weekly thereafter (plus an IV loading dose [‚Äö√†¬∫10 mg/kg] on day 1) or IV abatacept (‚Äö√†¬∫10 mg/kg) on days 1, 15, and 29 and every 4 weeks thereafter. The primary end point for determining the noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept was the proportion of patients in each group meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) at month 6. Other efficacy end points, immunogenicity, and safety were also assessed.
RESULTS: Of 1,457 patients, 693 of 736 (94.2%) treated with SC abatacept and 676 of 721 (93.8%) treated with IV abatacept completed 6 months. At month 6, 76.0% (95% confidence interval 72.9, 79.2) of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% (95% confidence interval 72.6, 79.0) of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response (estimated difference between groups 0.3% [95% confidence interval -4.2, 4.8]), confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. Onset and magnitude of ACR responses and disease activity and physical function improvements were comparable between the SC and IV abatacept-treated groups. The proportions of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs over 6 months were 67.0% and 4.2%, respectively, in the SC abatacept-treated group and 65.2% and 4.9%, respectively, in the IV abatacept-treated group, with comparable frequencies of serious infections, malignancies, and autoimmune events between groups. SC injection site reactions (mostly mild) occurred in 19 SC abatacept (IV placebo)-treated patients (2.6%) and 18 IV abatacept (SC placebo)-treated patients (2.5%). Abatacept-induced antibodies occurred in 1.1% of SC abatacept-treated patients and 2.3% of IV abatacept-treated patients.
CONCLUSION: SC abatacept provides efficacy and safety comparable with that of IV abatacept, with low immunogenicity and high retention rates, consistent with the established IV abatacept profile. Rates of injection site reactions were low. SC abatacept will provide additional treatment options, such as an alternative route of administration, for patients with RA."

The ACQUIRE trial showed comparable safety and efficacy in SC vs IV ABA over 6 mths1; here, we present 18-mth data from the long-term extension (LTE). Methods: ACQUIRE was a Phase IIIb, 6-mth, double-blind (DB) double-DUMMY study of pts with active RA (>=10 swollen and >=12 tender joint count [TJC and SJC], CRP >=0.8 mg/dL) refractory to MTX. Pts were randomized to SC ABA (125 mg/week) with IV ABA loading (~10 mg/kg) on Day 1 or IV ABA (~10 mg/kg) on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 4 wks for 6 mths; all pts received MTX. After 6 mths pts could enter the open-label LTE to receive SC ABA 125 mg/week. Safety, immunogenicity (by electrochemiluminescence), and efficacy (ACR 20, 50 and 70 and HAQ-DI responses [improvement from baseline (BL) >=0.3]) were assessed for pts treated with >=1 dose of ABA in the LTE. Efficacy data are as-observed; not all pts reached later timepoints at time of analyses. Results: Of 1372 pts entering the LTE, 1222 (89.1%) remained on therapy at time of reporting. Overall mean BL RA duration was 8 yrs, TJC and SJC were 30 and 20, and HAQ-DI was 1.7; characteristics were similar between groups. Median (SD) ABA exposure was 22 (3.8) mths. The IR (events/100 pt-yrs) of SAEs in the LTE was comparable with that seen with SC ABA in the DB period (9.00 [95% CI: 7.69-10.55] and 9.02 [6.31-12.90], respectively) and did not increase with increasing exposure (not shown). The IR of overall and serious infections in the LTE did not increase vs the DB period (47.64 [44.01-51.58] vs 84.62 [74.50-96.11] and 1.97 [1.41-2.74] vs 1.48 [0.62-3.56] respectively) and did not increase with increasing exposure (not shown). Opportunistic infections in the LTE included 3 TB cases and 2 candidiasis cases; no opportunistic infections were observed in the DB period. Injection site reactions occurred in 24 (1.7%) pts in the LTE (none serious). ABA-induced antibodies occurred in 39/1365 (2.9%) pts in the LTE; 4/11 pts with anti-CTLA4 antibodies eligible for testing were positive for neutralizing antibody. Immunogenicity did not affect efficacy, safety or ABA pharmacokinetics (data not shown). ACR responses up to Mth 24 were maintained from Mth 6 and comparable between original SC vs IV groups (Fig). DAS28 remission rates (95% CIs) were 24 (21-27) [n=685] vs 25% (22-28) [n=688] at Day 169 and 32 (22-42) [n=85] vs 31% (20-41) [n=72] at Day 729 in the original SC vs IV groups, respectively.

The objective of this study was to compare drug and adverse event costs and cost per successful clinical response with tocilizumab (TCZ) monotherapy vs adalimumab (ADA) monotherapy in patients with RA in a phase 4 clinical trial., METHODS: Patients received either TCZ intravenously every 4 weeks or ADA subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. Drug and administration costs were based on wholesale acquisition costs and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, respectively. Outcomes included patient-level drug costs, cost of hospitalization due to adverse events, and cost per response. Cost per response was calculated by dividing the mean drug plus administration cost by the proportion of patients achieving Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) < 2.6 (remission) or 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement in response per the American College of Rheumatology (ACR20/50/70). Hospitalization costs were calculated using the daily hospital cost and number of hospital days., RESULTS: Among the 163 patients treated with TCZ and 162 patients treated with ADA, mean total drug and administration costs per patient over 24 weeks were $18,290.60 and $25,623.10, respectively. Mean drug and administration costs per each clinical response achieved were lower with TCZ than with ADA (DAS28 < 2.6: $45,868 vs $244,174; ACR20: $28,127 vs $51,887; ACR50: $38,720 vs $92,244; ACR70: $56,253 vs $143,136). The total hospital days were 32 days with TCZ and 43 days with ADA; mean hospital costs per patient were $484.50 with TCZ and $651.10 with ADA., CONCLUSION: In this comparative assessment, the cost to achieve all 4 clinical endpoints was lower for patients receiving TCZ than for those receiving ADA."

We evaluated individual therapeutic responses as determined by the Disease Activity Score-28 joints critical difference for improvement (DAS28-dcrit) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with intravenous tocilizumab or comparator anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. The previously published DAS28-dcrit value [DAS28 decrease (improvement) >= 1.8] was retrospectively applied to data from two studies of tocilizumab in RA, the 52-week ACT-iON observational study and the 24-week ADACTA randomized study. Data were compared within (not between) studies. DAS28 was calculated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate as the inflammatory marker. Stability of DAS28-dcrit responses and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) good responses was determined by evaluating repeated responses at subsequent timepoints. A logistic regression model was used to calculate p values for differences in response rates between active agents. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs; pain, global health, function, and fatigue) in DAS28-dcrit responder versus non-responder groups were compared with an ANCOVA model. DAS28-dcrit individual response rates were 78.2% in tocilizumab-treated patients and 58.2% in anti-TNF-treated patients at week 52 in the ACT-ion study (p = 0.0001) and 90.1% versus 59.1% at week 24 in the ADACTA study (p < 0.0001). DAS28-dcrit responses showed greater stability over time (up to 52 weeks) than EULAR good responses. For both active treatments, DAS28-dcrit responses were associated with statistically significant improvements in mean PRO values compared with non-responders. The DAS28-dcrit response criterion provides robust assessments of individual responses to RA therapy and may be useful for discriminating between active agents in clinical studies and guiding treat-to-target decisions in daily practice."

Methods: Patients received either TCZ intravenously every 4√Ç weeks or ADA subcutaneously every 2√Ç weeks for 24√Ç weeks. Drug and administration costs were based on wholesale acquisition costs and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, respectively. Outcomes included patient-level drug costs, cost of hospitalization due to adverse events, and cost per response. Cost per response was calculated by dividing the mean drug plus administration cost by the proportion of patients achieving Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) < 2.6 (remission) or 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement in response per the American College of Rheumatology (ACR20/50/70). Hospitalization costs were calculated using the daily hospital cost and number of hospital days. Results: Among the 163 patients treated with TCZ and 162 patients treated with ADA, mean total drug and administration costs per patient over 24√Ç weeks were $18,290.60 and $25,623.10, respectively. Mean drug and administration costs per each clinical response achieved were lower with TCZ than with ADA (DAS28 < 2.6: $45,868 vs $244,174; ACR20: $28,127 vs $51,887; ACR50: $38,720 vs $92,244; ACR70: $56,253 vs $143,136). The total hospital days were 32√Ç days with TCZ and 43√Ç days with ADA; mean hospital costs per patient were $484.50 with TCZ and $651.10 with ADA. Conclusion: In this comparative assessment, the cost to achieve all 4 clinical endpoints was lower for patients receiving TCZ than for those receiving ADA."

We evaluated individual therapeutic responses as determined by the Disease Activity Score-28 joints critical difference for improvement (DAS28-dcrit) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with intravenous tocilizumab or comparator anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. The previously published DAS28-dcrit value [DAS28 decrease (improvement) ‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ‚àû¬¨‚Ä¢ 1.8] was retrospectively applied to data from two studies of tocilizumab in RA, the 52-week ACT-iON observational study and the 24-week ADACTA randomized study. Data were compared within (not between) studies. DAS28 was calculated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate as the inflammatory marker. Stability of DAS28-dcrit responses and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) good responses was determined by evaluating repeated responses at subsequent timepoints. A logistic regression model was used to calculate‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†p values for differences in response rates between active agents. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs; pain, global health, function, and fatigue) in DAS28-dcrit responder versus non-responder groups were compared with an ANCOVA model. DAS28-dcrit individual response rates were 78.2% in tocilizumab-treated patients and 58.2% in anti-TNF-treated patients at week 52 in the ACT-ion study (p = 0.0001) and 90.1% versus 59.1% at week 24 in the ADACTA study (p < 0.0001). DAS28-dcrit responses showed greater stability over time (up to 52‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†weeks) than EULAR good responses. For both active treatments, DAS28-dcrit responses were associated with statistically significant improvements in mean PRO values compared with non-responders. The DAS28-dcrit response criterion provides robust assessments of individual responses to RA therapy and may be useful for discriminating between active agents in clinical studies and guiding treat-to-target decisions in daily practice"

After the failure of treatment with a TNFi, treatment can be switched to another TNFi or a bDMARD with a different mode of action (non-TNFi). Measurement of serum drug concentrations and/or anti-drug antibodies (therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)) may help to inform the choice for the next step. However, the clinical utility of TDM to guide switching has not been investigated in a randomised test-treatment study., METHODS: ADDORA-switch is a 24-week, multi-centre, triple-blinded, superiority test-treatment randomised controlled trial. A total of 84 RA patients failing adalimumab treatment (treatment failure defined as DAS28-CRP > 2.9) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to a switching strategy to either TNFi or non-TNFi based on adalimumab serum trough level (intervention group) or random allocation (control group). The primary outcome is the between-group difference in mean time-weighted DAS28 over 24 weeks., DISCUSSION: The trial design differs in many aspects from previously published and ongoing TDM studies and is considered the first blinded test-treatment trial using TDM in RA. Several choices in the design of this trial are described, and overarching principles regarding test-treatment trials and clinical utility of TDM are discussed in further detail., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register NL8210 .

11083821,,10.3390/metabo11090632,"Diet is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). One explanation for this is its effect on specific lipids. However, knowledge on how the lipidome is affected is limited. We aimed to investigate if diet can change the new ceramide-and phospholipid-based CVD risk score CERT2 and the serum lipidome towards a more favorable CVD signature. In a crossover trial (ADIRA), 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had 10 weeks of a Mediterranean-style diet intervention or a Western-style control diet and then switched diets after a 4-month wash-out-period. Five hundred and thirty-eight individual lipids were measured in serum by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Lipid risk scores were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test or mixed model and lipidomic data with multivariate statistical methods. In the main analysis, including the 46 participants completing ‚â•1 diet period, there was no significant difference in CERT2 after the intervention compared with the control, although several CERT2 components were changed within periods. In addition, triacylglycerols, cholesteryl esters, phosphatidylcholines, alkylphosphatidylcholines and alkenylphosphatidylcholines had a healthier composition after the intervention compared to after the control diet. This trial indicates that certain dietary changes can improve the serum lipid signature towards a less atherogenic profile in patients with RA."

ADMYRA, a phase III double-blind study, was conducted with an aim to generate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity comparability data in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) having inadequate response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX). The study also evaluated an aspect of 'switching' reference product to the biosimilar in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity up to Week 48., METHODS: Eligible patients (N = 353) were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous (sc) SDZ-ADL 40 mg (n = 177) or ref-ADL (n = 176) every other week from Week 0 to Week 24. At Week 24, all patients with at least a moderate response by Disease Activity Score-28 including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) in the SDZ-ADL group continued SDZ-ADL (n = 159), and in the ref-ADL group were switched to SDZ-ADL (n = 166), treated for up to 46 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in DAS28-CRP from baseline at Week 12. Other efficacy endpoints included proportion of patients with European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response, EULAR remission, Boolean remission, safety and immunogenicity., RESULTS: The DAS28-CRP score changes from baseline at Week 12 were similar between SDZ-ADL (- 2.16) and ref-ADL (- 2.18) with a mean difference (95% CI) of 0.02 (- 0.24 to 0.27), which was within the pre-specified equivalence margin of +/- 0.6. After switching treatment from ref-ADL to SDZ-ADL, the mean DAS28-CRP change was similar between the SDZ-ADL and 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' group (- 3.09 vs - 3.05). The proportion of patients with good/moderate EULAR response was 69.2%/29.0% in the SDZ-ADL group and 68.0%/29.6% in the 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' group. The proportion of patients in EULAR remission was 51.4% and 54.4% and in Boolean remission was 16.8% and 21.6% for SDZ-ADL and 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' groups, respectively. The secondary endpoints were similar across the treatment groups. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) and injection-site reactions were low and similar between SDZ-ADL and 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' groups (AEs 70.6% vs 68.8%, injection-site reactions 4.0% vs 6.3%), and most of these patients experienced AEs of mild or moderate severity. Antidrug antibodies were detected in 24.2% and 25.6% of patients treated with SDZ-ADL and 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL', respectively, from baseline to Week 48, of which 72.5% in SDZ-ADL and 79.1% in 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' groups were neutralizing., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate-to-severe RA who had an inadequate response to DMARDs, SDZ-ADL demonstrated a similar efficacy and a comparable safety and immunogenicity profile to ref-ADL. Efficacy was sustained after switching from ref-ADL to SDZ-ADL with no impact on safety (NCT02744755)."

In the AGREE study, a large proportion of methotrexate (MTX)-naive pts with early RA achieved DAS28 remission over 1 yr; 41 (95% CI: 35-47) vs 23% (18-29) for pts treated with abatacept (ABA) + MTX vs MTX alone (p<0.001)2. Applying a threshold of a change from baseline (BL) in DAS28 of >0.6 (DAS28 response) or >=1.2 (clinically meaningful DAS28 response) during the first few mths of therapy may help identify pts more likely to reach Low Disease Activity State (LDAS) or remission at a later time-point. We present post-hoc analyses examining if a DAS28 response or a clinically meaningful DAS28 response at Mths 1-6 can predict likelihood of achieving remission or LDAS at Yr 1, in pts treated with ABA + MTX. Methods: In the 1-yr double-blind (DB) period of AGREE, MTX-naive pts with early (<=2 yrs) RA, poor prognostic factors and high disease activity, as evidenced by tender (>=12) and swollen (>=10) joint counts, were randomized 1:1 to ABA + MTX or placebo + MTX (MTX alone)2. All pts completing the DB period entered the open-label (OL) period to receive ABA + MTX. Remission was defined as DAS28-CRP <2.6 and LDAS as <=3.2. Likelihood of achieving remission at Yr 1 was evaluated for pts with a DAS28 response (change from BL >0.6) or a clinically meaningful DAS28 response (change from BL >=1.2) at Mths 1-6. Data are as observed for pts treated with >=1 dose of ABA in the OL period. Results: Analyses included 459 pts; 232 treated with ABA + MTX and 227 with MTX alone. BL characteristics were similar between groups1; mean (SD) DAS28-CRP was 6.3 (1.0) in each group. Over 90% of ABA + MTX-treated pts experienced a DAS28 response (change from BL >0.6) from Mths 2 through 6, compared with ~73-88% of MTX-alone treated pts (Table). For pts with DAS28 response at Mths 2 through 6, approximately 50% of ABA + MTX-treated pts achieved remission at Yr 1, vs ~30% of MTX-alone treated pts (Table); for these pts, >60% of the ABA + MTX group vs 44-48% of the MTX alone group achieved LDAS at Yr 1 (data not shown). Through Mths 2 to 6, 76-88% of ABA + MTX-treated pts achieved a clinically meaningful DAS28 response (change from BL >=1.2) vs 50-76% of MTX alone-treated pts (Table). Among these pts, ~50% of the ABA + MTX-treated group achieved remission at Yr 1 vs ~30% of MTX-alone treated group (Table); ~70% and 50-54% from each group, respectively, achieved LDAS (Table Presented) Conclusion: ABA + MTX-treated pts who achieve a DAS28 response (change from BL >0.6), or a clinically meaningful DAS28 response(change from BL >=1.2), during the first 6 mths of therapy have a higher likelihood (~50%) of achieving remission at Yr 1 vs MTX-alone treated pts (~30%).

RESULTS: Patients in the abatacept plus MTX and MTX monotherapy groups had similar baseline characteristics and were similar to the overall study population. The proportion of patients who achieved DAS28 (CRP) remission or LDAS was greater with abatacept plus MTX vs MTX alone [43.2% vs 22.7% (p < 0.001) and 57.4% vs 40.6% (p = 0.008), respectively].

Here we report the clinical and safety outcomes in methotrexate naive patients with early erosive RA treated with a combination of abatacept + methotrexate through 24 months. Method: The AGREE trial was a 24 month study with a 12 month double-blind period (DB) and 12 month open label period (OL). During DB, patients were randomized to ABA (~10 mg/kg dose based on weight range) + MTX (dosed up to 20 mg) or placebo (PLA) + MTX. All patients completing DB and entering OL received ABA + MTX. Safety was assessed in all pts receiving >=1 dose of ABA in OL. Clinical outcomes evaluated included DAS28 remission (DAS28 <2.6), low disease activity state (LDAS, DAS28 <= 3.2), and ACR responses. Results: All 459 pts completing DB entered OL; 94.3% completed OL. Remission, LDAS, and ACR responses were sustained or increased from 12 to 24 months in original ABA + MTX arm (Table), with over half (55.2%) in remission at 24 months. Proportion achieving these outcomes in the original MTX alone arm increased after initiating ABA in OL, with 44.5% in remission at 24 months. Rates (per 100 pt yrs) of serious AE (6.42 vs 8.35) and serious infections (1.73 vs 2.04) were similar in the OL vs DB respectively. Autoimmune events occurred at a similar rate in OL as in DB (1.30 vs 2.47, respectively). Two deaths occurred. No malignancies or TB were reported. (Table presented) Conclusion: Sustained disease remission is an achievable goal for many patients with early RA when treatment with combination of ABA + MTX is initiated early. Consistent with the long-term safety experience in patients with longer standing disease no new or unexpected safety signals occurred in this population. These data support the use of ABA + MTX in an early RA population."

METHODS: patients from the 1-year, double-blind Abatacept in Inadequate Responders to Methotrexate (AIM) study (NCT00048568) received open-label ABA (‚Äö√†¬∫10 mg/kg) in the longterm extension (LTE). Safety was assessed for patients who received ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 1 ABA dose, and efficacy for patients randomized to ABA and treated in the LTE. Radiographs were evaluated for changes in Genant-modified Sharp scores.
RESULTS: out of 652 patients, 539 entered the LTE (ABA, n = 378; placebo, n = 161). At Year 5, 72.4% were ongoing; discontinuation rates declined over time. Incidence rates of serious adverse events, serious infections, malignancies, and autoimmune events were 13.87, 2.84, 1.45, and 0.99 events/100 patient-years exposure, respectively. American College of Rheumatology 20 response was 82.3% (n = 373) and 83.6% (n = 268) at years 1 and 5, respectively. Disease Activity Score 28 C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) < 2.6 and ‚Äö√¢¬ß 3.2 were achieved by 25.4% and 44.1% of patients at Year 1 (n = 370), and 33.7% and 54.7% at Year 5 (n = 267), respectively. Mean changes in DAS28-CRP and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index at Year 1 [-2.83 (n = 365) and -0.68 (n = 369)] were maintained at Year 5 [-3.14 (n = 264) and -0.77 (n = 271)] for patients continuing treatment. Of them, 59.5% (n = 291) and 45.1% (n = 235) remained free from radiographic progression at years 1 and 5, respectively.
CONCLUSION: in MTX-refractory patients with RA, longterm ABA treatment was well tolerated and provided consistent safety and sustained efficacy, with high patient retention. Radiographic progression continued to be inhibited with ongoing treatment."
9737376,,10.3899/jrheum.130263,"Objective: To present the safety and efficacy of abatacept over 4 years in the AIM trial. Methods: AIM was a randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled trial of 12 months' duration. Patients received a fixed dose of abatacept (~10 mg/kg) or placebo, plus methotrexate (MTX). Patients completing the DB period were eligible to enroll in the open-label long-term extension (LTE) period (fixed dose of abatacept ~10 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus MTX). Safety was assessed for all patients who received >=1 dose of abatacept; incidence rates per 100 patient-years (pt-yrs) were calculated. Efficacy analyses included ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses, and are presented for all patients with data available at the visit of interest (as-observed analysis). Results: A total of 433 and 219 patients were randomized and treated with abatacept or placebo, respectively; 378 and 161 of these patients entered the LTE period. In total, 414/539 (76.8%) patients who entered the LTE remained on treatment at the end of the 4 year study period. The types and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were similar between the DB versus cumulative (combined DB + LTE) periods (303.4 vs 244.2/100 pt-yrs and 17.7 vs 14.7/100 pt-yrs, respectively). Incidence rates of infections and serious infections were 90.5 versus 69.0/100 pt-yrs and 4.2 versus 3.1/100 pt-yrs, in the DB versus cumulative periods, respectively. Malignancies, autoimmune events and tuberculosis (TB) were reported in 28 (4.7%), 45 (7.6%) and 3 (0.7%) patients, respectively, over 4 years. In the cumulative study period, 62 (10.4%) and 40 (6.7%) patients discontinued due to AEs and SAEs, respectively. The proportion of abatacept-treated patients who were ACR responders increased over 4 years; with no overlap of 95% CIs at 6 months and 4 years. Conclusion: In the LTE period of the AIM trial, the safety of abatacept remained consistent with the DB period, with no unique or unexpected events observed over 4 years. Retention rates remained high and abatacept provided durable improvements in ACR responses over 4 years of treatment."

11085150,,10.3390/jcm11247316,"Background: The optimal dose of rituximab in combination with leflunomide in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not known. Methods: In Part 1 (previously reported) of the investigator-initiated AMARA study (EudraCT 2009-015950-39; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01244958), improvements at week (W)24 were observed in patients randomized to rituximab + leflunomide compared with placebo + leflunomide. In the study reported here (Part 2), Part 1 responders received rituximab 500 or 1000 mg at W24/26 plus ongoing leflunomide. Patients were randomized at baseline to their eventual W24 treatment group. The Part 2 primary outcome was the mean Disease Activity Score-28 joints (DAS28) at W52, based on the last observation carried forward (LOCF) analyses and a two-sided analysis of variance. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and adverse events were evaluated. Results: Eighty-three patients received rituximab at W24/26 (31 rituximab‚Üírituximab 1000 mg; 29 rituximab‚Üírituximab 500 mg; 10 placebo‚Üírituximab 1000 mg; 13 placebo‚Üírituximab 500 mg). At W52, there were no significant differences in DAS28 between rituximab doses in patients originally treated with rituximab or those originally treated with placebo. In the Part 1 placebo group, the higher rituximab dose was associated with greater improvements in ACR response rates and some PROs. Adverse events were similar regardless of rituximab dose. Conclusions: Retreatment with rituximab 500 mg and 1000 mg showed comparable efficacy, whereas an initial dose of rituximab 500 mg was associated with lower response rates versus 1000 mg. Reduced treatment response with the lower dose in patients initially treated with placebo may have been influenced by small numbers and baseline disease activity."

Autoantibodies are known to target citrullinated vimentin. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the blood levels of MMP-degraded and citrullinated vimentin (VICM), as compared with the levels of MMP-degraded and non-citrullinated vimentin (VIM), and the standard anti-CCP biomarker in RA patients undergoing treatment. Thus, VIM, VICM and anti-CCP were quantified by ELISA in serum samples from baseline and week 8 of patients (n = 257) with RA, treated with either tocilizumab (8 mg/kg), methotrexate (7.5‚àí15 mg/kg) or a placebo and compared with a reference cohort (n = 64). The three biomarkers were elevated in RA serum compared with the reference cohort: medians were 1.7 vs. 0.8 ng/mL (p < 0.05) for VIM; 7.5 vs. 0.7 ng/mL (p < 0.0001) for VICM; 57 vs. 4 RU/mL (p < 0.001) for anti-CCP. VICM was decreased in response to tocilizumab (2.9-fold, p < 0.0001) and to methotrexate (1.5-fold, p < 0.05) compared with the placebo, while anti-CCP was not. Serum VIM was also modulated by both drugs, although to a lesser degree. A high baseline level of VICM was predictive of a low disease activity response at week 8. In conclusion, VICM can differentiate between RA and healthy donors in a similar manner to anti-CCP; furthermore, VICM is also a pharmacodynamic marker."
9261714,,10.3899/jrheum.120687,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the longterm safety and efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Patient data were from 5 randomized controlled TCZ trials (n = 4211), their open-label extension phases (n = 3512), and a drug interaction study (n = 23). All randomly assigned patients, regardless of previous RA treatment, were analyzed. Measures of safety included number of adverse events (AE), serious AE (SAE), AE leading to treatment discontinuation, laboratory tests, and deaths. Efficacy measures included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 responses, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), ACR core set components, and low disease activity (LDA) or Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) remission. ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) disease remission was a posthoc exploratory analysis.
RESULTS: Total duration of observation was 12,293 patient-years (PY). No new safety signals were identified; infections were the most common AE and SAE. The rate of serious infections was 4.5/100 PY. Improvements from baseline in clinical efficacy, measured as ACR20/50/70 responses, TJC, SJC, ACR core set components, and LDA and DAS28 remission, were generally sustained through at least 216 weeks of followup. ACR/EULAR disease remission was attained by 16.5% (Boolean) and 22.7% (index) of patients at Week 216.
CONCLUSION: TCZ has to date been studied for up to 4.6 years (240 weeks) of treatment in patients with RA. Our analysis reveals a longer-term safety profile consistent with previous observations, no new safety signals, and durable efficacy of TCZ in a large clinical trial program."

Effective treatment with biologic DMARDs poses a significant economic burden. The Abatacept versus Adalimumab Comparison in Biologic-Naive RA Subjects with Background Methotrexate (AMPLE) trial was a head-to-head, randomized study comparing abatacept in serum anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive patients, with increasing efficacy across ACPA quartile levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost per response accrued using abatacept versus adalimumab in ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients with RA from the health care perspective in Germany, Italy, Spain, the US and Canada. A cost-consequence analysis (CCA) was designed to compare the monthly costs per responding patient/patient in remission. Efficacy, safety and resource use inputs were based on the AMPLE trial. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis (OWSA) was also performed to assess the impact of model inputs on the results for total incremental costs. Cost per response in ACPA-positive patients favoured abatacept compared with adalimumab (ACR20, ACR90 and HAQ-DI). Subgroup analysis favoured abatacept with increasing stringency of response criteria and serum ACPA levels. Cost per remission (DAS28-CRP) favoured abatacept in ACPA-negative patients, while cost per CDAI and SDAI favoured abatacept in ACPA-positive patients. Abatacept was consistently favoured in ACPA-Q4 patients across all outcomes and countries. Cost savings were greater with abatacept when more stringent response criteria were applied and also with increasing ACPA levels, which could lead to a lower overall health care budget impact with abatacept compared with adalimumab.

However, information to guide physicians on the best choice of therapy in these patients is limited. The objective of this study was to describe the efficacy of subcutaneous abatacept versus adalimumab over 2 years in patients with seropositive, erosive early RA in the AMPLE study. Method(s): This exploratory post hoc analysis compared clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes in two subsets of patients: patients with early RA (<= 6 months' disease duration) who were seropositive for rheumatoid factor and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies and had > 1 radiographic erosion (Cohort 1); and patients with RA and absence of >= 1 of these inclusion criteria (Cohort 2). Result(s): Of the 646 randomized patients, Cohort 1 included 38 patients receiving abatacept and 45 receiving adalimumab, and Cohort 2 included 280 patients receiving abatacept and 283 receiving adalimumab. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally similar between treatment groups in both cohorts. Over 2 years, in Cohort 1, the adjusted mean change from baseline in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (using C-reactive protein) was numerically greater for abatacept than for adalimumab (mean difference at day 365 was 0.9, 95% confidence interval - 1.47 to - 0.33). Similar patterns of improvement were observed for other disease activity measures and physical function, but not for radiographic outcomes. No treatment-related differences were observed in Cohort 2. Conclusion(s): This analysis indicates a trend towards improved disease activity and physical function with abatacept versus adalimumab in patients with seropositive, erosive early RA.

Methods: the study aimed to recruit 206 male or female subjects from the secondary care hospital setting across the UK and the Netherlands. Participants who were at least 18 years old, who reported inflammatory sounding joint pain (clinically suspicious arthralgia) and who were found to be positive for serum autoantibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were eligible for enrolment. All study subjects were randomly assigned to receive weekly injections of investigational medicinal product, either abatacept or placebo treatment over the course of a 52-week period. Participants were followed up for a further 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was defined as the time to development of at least three swollen joints or to the fulfilment of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for RA using swollen but not tender joints, whichever endpoint was met first. In either case, swollen joints were confirmed by ultrasonography. Participants, care givers, and those assessing the outcomes were all blinded to group assignment. Clinical assessors and ultrasonographers were also blinded to each other's assessments for the duration of the study. Conclusions: there is limited experience of the design and implementation of trials for the prevention of inflammatory joint diseases. We discuss the rationale behind choice and duration of treatment and the challenges associated with defining the ""at risk"" state and offer pragmatic solutions in the protocol to enrolling subjects at risk of RA.

SF-36 summary scores for physical and mental components and for 6 of 8 health domains showed significantly greater improvements at week16 for the ETN‚Äö√Ñ√¢+‚Äö√Ñ√¢MTX group; only scores for physical functioning and role-emotional domains did not differ significantly between the two treatment arms. Greater improvements at week16 were noted for the ETN‚Äö√Ñ√¢+‚Äö√Ñ√¢MTX group for facit-fatigue, HADS, and WPAI: GH mean scores. CONCLUSION: combination therapy using ETN‚Äö√Ñ√¢+‚Äö√Ñ√¢MTX demonstrated superior improvements using a comprehensive set of PRO measures, compared to combination therapy with usual standard of care dmards plus MTX in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis from the asia-pacific region.

Participants who were at least 18 years old, who reported inflammatory sounding joint pain (clinically suspicious arthralgia) and who were found to be positive for serum autoantibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were eligible for enrolment. All study subjects were randomly assigned to receive weekly injections of investigational medicinal product, either abatacept or placebo treatment over the course of a 52-week period. Participants were followed up for a further 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was defined as the time to development of at least three swollen joints or to the fulfilment of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for RA using swollen but not tender joints, whichever endpoint was met first. In either case, swollen joints were confirmed by ultrasonography. Participants , care givers, and those assessing the outcomes were all blinded to group assignment. Clinical assessors and ultrasonographers were also blinded to each other's assessments for the duration of the study., CONCLUSIONS: There is limited experience of the design and implementation of trials for the prevention of inflammatory joint diseases.

 Ultrasonography (US) is an imaging modality which application is rapidly growing. It has a number of advantages over other advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including low cost, good accessibility, and ability to scan many joints in a short period of time. However, the additional benefit of using this modality in terms of patient outcomes has not been demonstrated. Thus, clarification is needed if the use of US leads to better care for RA patients.
 This study will assess if the use of a treatment strategy incorporating information from ultrasonography assessment will allow for better outcomes of patients with RA, than a strategy based on clinical and laboratory assessments alone."

METHODS: Data were derived from 2495 patients with RA enrolled in 3 clinical trials (ATTRACT, ASPIRE, and START) and treated with infliximab (3 to 10 mg/kg) plus methotrexate (MTX), or MTX plus placebo. The association of hemoglobin and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score was assessed at baseline (n = 2471) and Week 22 (n = 2458) by Spearman correlation, and multivariate linear regression models were employed to control for confounding effects from demographic and other clinical variables. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for a clinically meaningful improvement (> or = 0.25 point increase) in HAQ associated with a > or = 1 g/dl improvement in hemoglobin from baseline at Week 22.
RESULTS: About 37% of patients with RA had anemia based on World Health Organization criteria: hemoglobin < 12 g/dl in women (39%) and < 13 g/dl in men (32%). Low hemoglobin level was significantly associated with more severe physical disability at baseline (p < 0.001), and both male and female patients with anemia had more severe disability at baseline. Improvement in hemoglobin after treatment at Week 22 was an independent contributor to improvement in HAQ, and a > or = 1 g/dl improvement in hemoglobin after treatment was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in the HAQ score at Week 22 (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.10-1.86; p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Anemia is one of the independent factors contributing to physical disability in patients with RA. Improvement in anemia following effective RA treatment may play an independent role in improving physical function."

METHODS: Patients completing the 6-month, double-blind (DB) placebo-controlled period were eligible to enter the longterm extension (LTE), where all patients received abatacept every 4 weeks (‚Äö√†¬∫10 mg/kg, according to weight range). Safety, efficacy, physical function, and health-related quality of life were monitored throughout.
RESULTS: In total, 317 patients (218 DB abatacept, 99 DB placebo) entered the LTE; 150 (47.3%) completed it. Overall incidences of serious adverse events, infections, serious infections, malignant neoplasms, and autoimmune events did not increase during the LTE versus the DB period. American College of Rheumatology responses with abatacept at Month 6 were maintained over 5 years. At Year 5, among patients who received abatacept for 5 years and had available data, 38/103 (36.9%) achieved low disease activity as defined by the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)/C-reactive protein (CRP); 23/103 (22.3%) achieved DAS28/CRP-defined remission. Health Assessment Questionnaire response was achieved by 62.5% of patients remaining on treatment at Year 5; mean improvements from baseline in physical component summary and mental component summary scores were 7.34 and 6.42, respectively. High proportions of patients maintained efficacy and physical function benefits or improved their disease state at each timepoint throughout the LTE, if remaining on abatacept treatment.
CONCLUSION: Safety remained consistent, and abatacept efficacy was maintained from 6 months to 5 years, demonstrating the benefits of switching to abatacept in this difficult-to-treat population of patients with RA previously failing anti-TNF therapy."

Establishing an optimal threshold of inflammatory activity that predicts lower risk of structural damage progression may inform treatment decisions. This post hoc analysis investigated whether patients with RA at low risk of structural damage progression can be identified based on MRI inflammation thresholds., METHODS: Hand and wrist MRI was performed at baseline, and at months 6 and 12 in a phase 3b, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind trial of abatacept in early RA (AVERT). Pathologies were scored using the OMERACT RA MRI Score. Data were stratified into two risk subgroups (less and more severe inflammation) for structural damage progression (erosion change > 0.5) based on baseline inflammation. In this post hoc analysis, log odds ratios of probability of progression {adjusted for baseline Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [C-reactive protein; DAS28 (CRP)]} were compared between subgroups to test the performance of inflammation thresholds., RESULTS: There were 351 randomized and treated patients with baseline MRIs, of whom 276 (78.6%) and 235 (67.0%) had MRIs available at months 6 and 12, respectively. The DAS28 (CRP)-adjusted probabilities of progression from baseline to month 12 based on scores at baseline, and from months 6 to 12 based on month 6 scores, were significantly lower among patients with less inflammation (P < 0.0001-0.0459), independent of clinical disease activity. Predefined thresholds of synovitis <= 3 (total score 21), osteitis <= 3 (total score 69) and total inflammation score (osteitis double-weighted) <= 9 were associated with a lower likelihood of structural damage progression in unadjusted analyses., CONCLUSION: Levels of MRI-determined inflammatory activity below defined thresholds were independently associated with a lower risk of structural damage progression in early RA, providing a potential trial endpoint for levels of inflammation not associated with progression., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01142726., FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb."

All RA treatments were withdrawn after 12 months in patients with Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (C-reactive protein; DAS28-CRP) < 3.2. In this post hoc analysis, the proportion of patients achieving protocol-defined remission (DAS28-CRP < 2.6) or improvement in physical function at 12 and at both 12 and 18 months was assessed according to symptom duration (<= 3 months, > 3 to <= 6 months, or > 6 months) and treatment group. No clinically significant differences were seen in baseline demographics or characteristics across symptom duration groups. Irrespective of baseline symptom duration, a numerically higher proportion of abatacept plus MTX-treated patients achieved DAS-defined remission at month 12 and sustained remission at month 18 compared with MTX monotherapy. A numerically higher proportion of abatacept plus MTX-treated patients with symptom duration <= 3 months maintained DAS-defined remission after complete treatment withdrawal from 12 to 18 months compared with longer symptom duration groups. This subgroup also had the fastest onset of clinical response (DAS28-CRP < 2.6) after initiation of treatment. Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index response was similar regardless of baseline symptom duration.

Radiographs of hands and feet were assessed using the modified sharp/van der heijde score and radiographic progression was defined AS an increase in the total sharp score above 5.8 (the smallest detectable change). DESIGN: prospective, randomised study of patients with early RA. SETTING: secondary level of care; six participating centres from southern sweden; both urban and rural populations. PARTICIPANTS: in all, 225 patients, 64% women, with a diagnosis of RA according to the american college of rheumatology criteria, were included if they were between 18 and 80‚ÄÖyears of age and had a disease duration of less than 1‚ÄÖyear. INTERVENTION: the patients were randomised to 7.5‚ÄÖmg prednisolone daily for 2‚ÄÖyears (p-group; n=108) or no prednisolone (nop-group; n=117) when they started with their first disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug and were prospectively followed for 2‚ÄÖyears. RESULTS: the frequency of patients with radiographic progression after 2‚ÄÖyears was 26% in the p-group and 39% in the nop-group (p=0.033). Relevant interactions between treatment and rheumatoid factor (RF) (p=0.061) and between treatment and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 2 (anti-ccp) (p=0.096) were found. RF and anti-ccp independently predicted radiographic progression only in the nop-group, OR (95% CI) 9.4 (2.5 to 35.2), p=0.001 and OR (95% CI) 8.7 (2.5 to 31.3), p=0.001, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: the presence of RF and anti-ccp predicted radiographic progression in patients not treated with prednisolone but failed to predict progression in patients treated with this drug. The data suggest that early treatment with prednisolone may modulate not only inflammation but also autoimmunity-associated pathogenetic mechanisms. Trial registration number: isrctn20612367."
9260964,,10.3899/jrheum.121248,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether early swelling and tenderness in large joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is predictive of later local damage and whether this leads to functional disability.
METHODS: Two-year clinical and 8-year radiological followup data from the BeSt study (trial numbers NTR262 and NTR265), a randomized controlled treat-to-target trial, were used. The association between early local joint swelling and/or tenderness (at least once, or for ‚â• 2 consecutive visits) and later large-joint damage (Larsen score ‚â• 1) was assessed using generalized estimating equations. The association between large-joint damage and functional ability [by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)] was assessed using logistic and linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Clinical and 8-year radiological data were available for 290 patients. Concomitant local joint swelling and tenderness at least once in the first 2 years was independently associated with damage of the large joints (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.7-3.6), as was swelling without tenderness (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6). Stronger effects were seen for persistent swelling and/or tenderness. Other independent predictors for joint damage were baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02) and the presence of rheumatoid factor and/or anticitrullinated protein antibodies (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.1; and OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.8, respectively). Patients with large-joint damage had a higher HAQ score after 8 years than patients without (difference 0.15).
CONCLUSION: Early local swelling and tenderness are independent predictors of later joint damage in these joints after 8 years of Disease Activity Score-guided treatment in patients with RA. This suggests that suppression of local inflammation could help prevent local damage and functional disability."

Patients who did not have an ALT of >2‚àö√≥ ULN used more concomitant disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and longer.
CONCLUSIONS: in RA patients treated with MTX according to a dynamic strategy resembling daily clinical practice, incidence of increased ALT of >2‚àö√≥ ULN was lower than previously reported, and also without treatment adjustments, persistence was rare. The recommendations for ALT monitoring may be reevaluated."

We compared 2 patient groups who were treated for 5 years aiming at DAS<1.6 or DAS<=2.4. Methods: Five years outcomes were compared in 133 patients from the BeSt study (inclusion criteria: early (<=2 years symptom duration) active (>=6 of 66 swollen joints, >=6 of 68 tender joints, and either erythrocyte sedimentation rate >=28 mm/hour or a visual analogue scale global health score >=20mm) RA (1987)), randomized to initial therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine and tapered high dose of prednisone (arm 3), targeted at DAS<=2.4 ('LDA target group'), and 175 early RA patients from the IMPROVED-study who would have fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the BeSt-study, who started with methotrexate and tapered high dose of prednisone, targeted at DAS<1.6 ('remission target group'). To correct for baseline differences, the associations of treatment target with achieving DAS<1.6, Boolean remission at year 1 and drug-free DAS-remission (DFR) at year 5 were analysed by logistic regression analysis. Results: At baseline, patients in the remission target group had earlier and less active disease than the LDA target group (mean DAS+/-SD 4.1+/-0.7 vs 4.4+/-0.9, p=0.012) (table), and they had better outcomes at the first evaluation point (after 4 months of treatment and 3 months in the LDA target group). The DAS target was achieved by 56% (LDA target group) and 53% (remission target group) (table). At year 1, the DAS target was achieved by 67% (DAS<=2.4) and 51% (DAS<1.6). Similar percentages in both groups had a DAS<=2.4 (67% (DAS<=2.4) and 73% (DAS<1.6), p=0.333), but DAS<1.6 was achieved more often in the remission targeted group (51% (DAS<1.6) vs 30% (DAS<=2.4), p<0.001). DFR was by protocol not possible at year 1 in the LDA targeted group. 15% of the remission target group were in DFR. There was less radiological damage progression in the remission target group (median (IQR)/mean+/-SD 0 (0-0)/0+/-0.2 (DAS<1.6) vs 0 (0-1)/0.9+/-2.3 (DAS<=2.4), p<0.001). At year 5, the target was achieved in 43% (remission target group) and 61% (LDA target group). DAS<=2.4 was achieved in similar percentages (61% vs 61%, p=0.092). More patients in the remission targeted group had DAS<1.6 and DFR (43% vs 32%, p=0.003, and 18% vs 8%, p=0.003, respectively). DAS<1.6 as treatment target was associated with more DAS<1.6 (OR 3.04 (95% CI 1.64-5.62)) and Boolean remission (3.03 (1.45-6.33)) at year 1 and more DFR at year 5 (3.77 (1.51-9.43)) corrected for gender, symptom duration, baseline DAS, baseline SHS, and time on anti-TNF. Conclusion: Early active RA patients had better outcomes after DAS<1.6 than DAS<=2.4 steered treatment. DAS-remission targeted treatment was an independent predictor for achieving DAS<1.6 and Boolean remission at year 1 and DFR at year 5. (Table Presented)."
9263471,,10.3899/jrheum.121248,"Background/Purpose: To assess the association between local swelling and pain in the large joints in the first 2 years after diagnosis of RA with radiological damage in these joints after 8 years. Methods: Two-year clinical data and 8-year radiological data from the BeSt study, a randomized controlled trial designed to assess 4 different treatment strategies, were used. Two-year clinical data were chosen because disease activity was highest in these years and clinical symptoms were unlikely to be caused by large joint damage. Patients were treated according to a disease activity steered protocol. Radiographs were scored by an experienced radiologist (HK) using the Larsen score (ranging from 0-5 in each joint). Swelling and pain in these joints were assessed 3-monthly, with exception of swelling in the hips. The association between swelling and pain in each large joint (at least once, or prolonged, i.e. at least 2 consecutive visits) and joint damage in this joint was assessed using generalized estimating equations. Swelling (model 1), pain (model 2) and swelling and pain (model 3) were entered as predictors, adjusted for baseline age, ESR, and body mass index (BMI), gender and time-averaged DAS, treatment strategy, rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), or a combination of these variables. Large joint damage (yes/no) was the outcome measure. Results: Clinical and radiological data were available in 290 patients. Joint damage was observed in 64/532 (12%) shoulders, 51/538 (9.5%) elbows, 141/541 (26%) wrists, 67/521 (13%) hips, 95/528 (18%) knees and 39/544 (7%) ankles. Damage in at least 1 large joint was found in 64% of patients. Local pain and swelling in the first 2 years after diagnosis were most often observed in the wrists and ankles. Local swelling at least once in the first 2 years was independently associated with joint damage of the large joints, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% C.I. 1.3-2.3) (Table 1). Prolonged swelling and prolonged pain were both independent predictors of local joint damage, with an OR of 2.5 (95% C.I. 1.8-3.4) for prolonged swelling and of 1.4 (95% C.I. 1.05-1.9) for prolonged pain. Other independent predictors were baseline ESR (OR 1.01, 95%C.I. 1.001-1.02) and the presence of RF or ACPA (OR 2.2, 95% C.I. 1.3-3.8), or a combination of these two (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1.5-4.0). (Table presented) Local swelling and prolonged local pain in a large joint in the first 2 years after diagnosis of RA are independent predictors of later joint damage in that joint. These results suggest that local control of inflammation might be beneficial to prevent damage."

Methods: A questionnaire is taken at the start in all parents of the participants of the BeSt for Kids trial, treated with either initial sequential monotherapy (group 1) with either methotrexate or sulfasalazine, initial combination therapy with methotrexate and tapered prednisone (group 2), or initial combination therapy with methotrexate and etanercept (group 3). ACRp50 is the primary goal, treatment adjustments are made every 3 months to aim at clinical remission on medication from 6 months and onwards. The questionnaire explores parental preferences or dislikes for the initial therapy. Results: In total, parents of 31 out of 32 so far included patients (97%) completed the questionnaire. 38% of the parents expressed no preference and 53% of the parents expressed no aversion for a particular treatment group. 41% had hoped for assignment to group 3 and 6% had hoped against assignment to group 3. Primary aversion was highest in the second group with 25% due to disliking having to take prednisone. Conclusions: This is the first prospective evaluation of parents' preferences in newly diagnosed juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients participating in the BeSt for Kids trial. Within the limitations of the small amounts, patients clearly preferred initial combination therapy with etanercept and disliked taking prednisone. After actual exposure and follow up, this questionnaire will be repeated to see if preferences remain the same."

Traditionally, these patients maintain standard dosage of bDMARD lifelong; however, recent studies indicate that a significant proportion of patients in sustained remission or LDA can taper their bDMARD and maintain stable disease activity. Thus, this trial aims to evaluate whether a disease activity-guided tapering strategy for bDMARDs will enable a significant dosage reduction while maintaining disease activity compared with usual care. From the individual patient's standpoint as well as from a societal perspective, it would be advantageous if bDMARDs could be reduced or even discontinued while maintaining disease activity. Methods and analysis: a total of 180 patients with RA, PsA or axSpA treated with bDMARDs and in clinical remission/LDA during the past 12 months will be enrolled from four centres in Denmark. Patients will be randomised in a ratio of 2: 1 to either disease activity-guided tapering of bDMARDs (intervention group) or continuation of bDMARDs as usual care (control group).

However, VAS valuations can differ according to their presentation. We compared patient responses to 2 VAS scales from 2 different instruments, each asking ""how good or bad is your health today, in your opinion"", ranging from 100 ""Best imaginable health state"" to 0 ""Worst imaginable health state."" Methods: Patients were participants in a randomised controlled trial of aggressive vs. symptomatic control of inflammation in patients with established (>5 years duration) stable rheumatoid arthritis followed for 3 years. Patients completed the EuroQol (EQ-VAS), patient global assessment VAS (PG-VAS), HAQ and DAS28 at baseline and a 3 year follow-up assessment. The EQ-VAS is a 20cm vertical scale, with 100 at the top, with markers at each increment of 10. The PG-VAS is a horizontal 10 cm scale from left (0) to right (100) with no incremental markers. Cross-sectional correlations were assessed using Spearman's rank, and longitudinal correlations assessed using Pearson correlation. Differences between VAS scales were calculated and compared across the range of values using a locally weighted regression line. Results: PG-VAS and EQ-VAS assessments were completed by 449 patients with a mean (s.d.) age of 61 (11), disease duration of 13 (7) years. 68% were female. Median (IQR) baseline HAQ and DAS28 scores were 1.5 (0.9, 2.0) and 4.0 (3.1, 4.9) respectively; self-reported health scores were EQ-VAS 65 (50, 80) and PG-VAS 66 (51, 77). Despite similar median scores, the correlation of VAS scores was only moderate (0.58). PG-VAS scores were evenly distributed; EQ-VAS scores clustered at scale increments of 10. There was a systematic trend in the difference between scores. EQ-VAS scores<50 tended to be lower than the PG-VAS, whilst EQ-VAS>50 were higher. 3-year change was calculated for 375 patients; the mean change for the PG-VAS and EQ-VAS was -4.9 (s.d. 22.1) and -3.8 (s.d. 20.8) respectively. The correlation of change scores was 0.51. Within patient differences between VAS scores exceeded 10, the minimum important difference for these global health VAS scales, in 176 (39%) patients at baseline and in the change scores of 210 (46%) patients. Rounding PG-VAS and EQ-VAS scores to the nearest increment of 10 to account for clustering around markers did not improve cross-sectional (0.57) or longitudinal (0.49) correlations. Conclusions: Even when asking the same question, scores on global health VAS scales appear sensitive to presentation and/or the context in which they are asked. Differences between scores were not explained by the presence of markers on the scale. Differences may be due to the horizontal/vertical presentation, length, or questions preceding the scale. The EQ-VAS followed general quality of life questions and the PG-VAS followed pain and fatigue scales; preceding questions may prime patients to respond differently to global health VAS scales."

9260804,,10.1007/s00198-012-2073-z,"Addition of 10 mg prednisone daily to a methotrexate-based tight control strategy does not lead to bone loss in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving preventive treatment for osteoporosis. A small increase in lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) during the first year of treatment was recorded, regardless of use of glucocorticoids.
INTRODUCTION: this study aims to describe effects on BMD of treatment according to EULAR guidelines with a methotrexate-based tight control strategy including 10 mg prednisone daily versus the same strategy without prednisone in early RA patients who received preventive therapy for osteoporosis.
METHODS: early RA patients were included in the CAMERA-II trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 2-year trial, in which effects of addition of 10 mg prednisone daily to a methotrexate-based tight control strategy were studied. All patients received calcium, vitamin D and bisphosphonates. Disease activity was assessed every 4 weeks. Radiographs of hands and feet and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of lumbar spine and left hip were performed at baseline and after 1 and 2 years of treatment.
RESULTS: BMD increased significantly over time in both treatment groups at the lumbar spine with a mean of 2.6% during the first year (p<0.001), but not at the hip; at none of the time points did BMD differ significantly between the prednisone and placebo group. Higher age and lower weight at baseline and higher disease activity scores during the trial, but not glucocorticoid therapy, were associated with lower BMD at both the lumbar spine and the hip in mixed-model analyses.
CONCLUSION: addition of 10 mg prednisone daily to a methotrexate-based tight control strategy does not lead to bone loss in early RA patients on bisphosphonates. A small increase in lumbar BMD during the first year of treatment was found, regardless of use of glucocorticoids."
11084724,,10.3899/jrheum.200213,"OBJECTIVE: Current smoking reduces clinical response to several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. It is unknown if this is also the case for prednisone. We aimed to determine whether current smoking affects the clinical response to concomitant prednisone in a methotrexate (MTX)-based treatment strategy., METHODS: In the CAMERA-II trial (isrctn.com identifier: 70365169), patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initiated an MTX-based strategy and were randomized to concomitant prednisone (MTX + pred) or placebo (MTX + PBO) for 24 months. Linear mixed modeling was performed with Disease Activity Score assessing 28 joints (DAS28) as the dependent variable, and strategy group and current smoking status as independent variables, correcting for relevant covariates. The interaction between current smoking and strategy was tested to find out whether the effect of current smoking on clinical response was different between the strategy groups with prednisone or PBO., RESULTS: Current smoking was significantly associated with higher DAS28 over time (mean difference with nonsmokers 0.57 [95% CI 0.22-0.92, P < 0.01]). This association was not different between the strategy groups with prednisone or PBO (P = 0.73). The negative effect of current smoking on DAS28 was dose dependent., CONCLUSION: Current smoking in patients with early RA significantly reduces the clinical effect of an MTX-based strategy, independent of whether concomitant prednisone is used. This effect is dose dependent. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Journal of Rheumatology."
9261030,,10.3899/jrheum.131401,"Objective. Early intensive treatment is now the cornerstone for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the era of personalized medicine, when treatment is becoming more individualized, it is unclear from the current literature whether all patients with RA benefit equally from such intensive therapies. We investigated the benefit of different treatment regimens on remission rates when stratified to clinical and serological factors. Methods. The Combination Anti-rheumatic Drugs in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CARDERA) trial recruited patients with RA of less than 2 years' duration who had active disease. The trial compared 4 treatment regimens: methotrexate monotherapy, 2 different double therapy regimens (methotrexate and cyclosporine or methotrexate and prednisolone) and 3-drug therapy. Clinical predictors included age, male sex, and tender joint count (TJC) and serological biomarkers included rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). Results. Patients who were male, over 50 years, had > 6 TJC, were RF-IgM-positive, or ACPA-positive were more likely to achieve remission at 24 months using 3-drug therapy compared to monotherapy (OR 2.99, 4.95, 2.71, 2.54, and 3.52, respectively). There were no differences in response to monotherapy and 3-drug therapy if patients were female, under 50 years, had < 6 TJC, or were seronegative. Conclusion. Early intensive regimens have become the gold standard in the treatment of early RA. Our study suggests that this intensive approach is only superior to monotherapy in certain subsets of patients. Although these are unlikely to be the only predictors of treatment response, our study brings us a step closer to achieving personalized medicine in RA. Copyright  2014. All rights reserved."

Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective study, 40 patients with active RA were enrolled and randomized to 3 groups. They were treated with 40 mg (n = 16) or 80 mg adalimumab (n = 16) in addition to a background treatment (stable doses of methotrexate), or with placebo + background treatment (n = 8). Symptom improvements and adverse reactions were assessed at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12. Serum RF and anti-CCP autoantibodies were detected at baseline and at 12 weeks of follow-up. Results: The proportion of achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, 50, and 70 response criteria were significant higher in adalimumab groups than in placebo group (P < 0.01). Tender joint count, swollen joint count, duration of morning stiffness, VAS score, HAQ and CRP were significantly decreased 12 weeks after adalimumab treatment (P < 0.05). Adalimumab induced a significant decrease in serum levels of RF and anti-CCP (P < 0.05), and the decrease in antibody titers was not seen in placebo group. The titers correlated with the clinical response to the therapy. Adalimumab was well-tolerated; adverse effects were little and light. Conclusion: Treatment with adalimumab plus methotrexate is more effective than methotrexate alone in active RA patients; the onset of effect is rapid. The titers of RF and anti-CCP autoantibodies may be potentially useful indicators to assess the effect of anti-TNF-alpha treatment in RA patients."

9262333,,10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014816,"INTRODUCTION: cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and among these patients, the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is high. Moreover, low vitamin D levels have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk in healthy subjects.
OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the long-term risk of cardiovascular events in patients having low total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at baseline compared with patients with normal levels, in an efficiently treated, closed cohort of patients with an early diagnosis of RA.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: this study is a prospective, closed, blinded endpoint cohort study, based on secondary analyses from a previous randomised trial (CIMESTRA study; NCT00209859, approved September 1999) including 160 patients with an early diagnosis of RA from Danish University clinics. Primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with any cardiovascular event in the follow-up period, evaluated using systematic journal audits. Logistic regression models will test the hypothesis that there are more cardiovascular events in enrolled patients with a low level of vitamin D (< 50‚ÄÖnmol/L). Secondarily, Cox regression models, based on survival analysis, will determine the extent to which independent variables (including different levels of vitamin D at baseline) predict whether a cardiovascular event will occur, and also when this will be.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: all patients have received verbal and written information before enrolment, and have given written consent at baseline. To disseminate comprehension of factors of prognostic importance to cardiovascular outcome in RA, we will attempt to have a first draft ready no later than 1‚ÄÖyear after the adjudication process has finished. If low vitamin D levels can predict cardiovascular events in RA, it is relevant to take into account in a prediction model, to be considered by patients, physicians and other decision-makers.

9260582,,10.3899/jrheum.091265,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between markers of collagen II synthesis and degradation with disease activity measures, autoantibodies, and radiographic outcomes in a 4-year protocol on patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are na‚àö√òve to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.
METHODS: One hundred sixty patients with newly diagnosed, untreated RA entered the Cyclosporine, Methotrexate, Steroid in RA (CIMESTRA) trial. Disease activity and radiograph status were measured at baseline and 4 years. The N-terminal propeptide of collagen IIA (PIIANP) and the cross-linked C-telopeptide of collagen II (CTX-II) were quantified at baseline by ELISA. PIIANP was also assayed at 2 and 4 years. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) was recorded at baseline. An uncoupling index for cartilage collagen metabolism was calculated from PIIANP and CTX-II measurements.
RESULTS: PIIANP was low at diagnosis and 4 years on (p < 0.001), irrespective of treatment and disease activity. PIIANP was lowest in anti-CCP positive patients (p = 0.006), and there was a negative correlation between PIIANP and anti-CCP titers (rho = -0.25, p 0.002). CTX-II was increased (p < 0.001) and correlated positively with disease activity and radiographic progression, but not with anti-CCP (p = 0.93). The uncoupling index was not superior to CTX-II in predicting radiographic changes.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cartilage collagen formation and degradation are unbalanced when RA is diagnosed. The different associations of collagen II anabolism (PIIANP) and collagen II degradation (CTX-II) with anti-CCP, synovitis, and radiographic progression indicate that at this early stage of RA, cartilage collagen degradation is mainly driven by synovitis, while anti-CCP antibodies may interfere with cartilage regeneration by inhibiting collagen IIA formation.

METHODS/DESIGN: CORRA is an investigator-initiated, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two treatment arms, starting with 60 mg or 10 mg prednisolone per day, tapered down to 5 mg prednisolone within eight weeks, and one placebo arm, each arm comprising 150 patients. The duration of the intervention is 12 weeks. In parallel, all patients will be treated with methotrexate (usual dosage 15 mg/week). The primary efficacy endpoint is the progression of radiographic joint damage after one year compared to baseline. Important secondary endpoints are the percentage of patients in remission, patient global assessment of disease activity, and changes of functional capacity. Safety monitoring is performed.The statistical analysis is performed in three hierarchical steps. The first step is an analysis of covariance (Œ±‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05) to compare the group with the initial prednisolone dosage of 60 mg and the placebo group. In case of a statistically significant result, the comparison of the group starting with 10 mg prednisolone with the placebo group will be performed as a second step (Œ±‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05). In case of superiority of the 10 mg prednisolone group versus the placebo group, the third step will be a non-inferiority test for the 10 mg prednisolone group versus the 60 mg prednisolone group (Œ±‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.025).
DISCUSSION: The CORRA trial will yield information concerning the optimal glucocorticoid dosage schedule in the treatment of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.

After 1 year, antirheumatic treatment was at the discretion of treating rheumatologists. BMD was measured at baseline and after 1, 2 and 4 years at hips and lumbar spine with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. BMD changes between treatment strategies on average over time were compared with GEE analysis., RESULTS: Data from 155 out of 162 patients could be analysed: 68% were female with a mean age of 52 (SD 13) years. Both COBRA-light and COBRA therapy showed declines in BMD at the total hip of -3.3% and -1.7%, respectively (p = 0.12), and the femoral neck, -3.7% and -3.0%, respectively (p = 0.95). At the lumbar spine, both treatment groups showed minor decline in BMD over 4 years: -0.5% and -1.0%, respectively (p = 0.10)., CONCLUSION: In a treat-to-target design in early RA, over 4 years, no differences between groups were found in change in BMD at total hip, femoral neck and the lumbar spine. At the hip, bone loss was around 3% in both groups, while mild bone loss was observed at lumbar spine, both in patients starting prednisolone 60 and 30 mg/day. These data suggest that the well-known negative effects of prednisolone can be modulated by modern treatment of RA."

Since high-dose glucocorticoids are associated with bone loss, we investigated the differences in bone mineral density (BMD) after one year of treatment in both arms. Objectives: to determine whether there is a significant differ-ence in BMD between COBRA and COBRA-light, and to determine the difference in change in BMD between baseline and 52 weeks between these groups, at the lumbar spine (L1-L4), total hip, and femoral neck. Methods: an open-label, randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial of patients with active, newly diagnosed RA following a treat-to-target protocol. Results: BMD data were determined in 144 out of 164 included RA patients, all randomized to either COBRA (n=71) or COBRA-light (n=73) therapy. Both at baseline and after 52 weeks, no significant difference in BMD was found between COBRA and COBRA-light, at all sites. Changes between baseline and week 52 are shown in Ta b l e 1. No significant difference in change in BMD between COBRA and COBRA-light was found, at all sites. However, COBRA-light showed a significant decrease in BMD in the lumbar spine and total hip after 52 weeks, whereas the femoral neck and the COBRA group did not. Conclusions: no difference in change in BMD between COBRA and COBRA-light was found. The overall bone loss was small, which suggests that the negative effects of (high-dose) prednisone on bone might be counteracted by the large reduction in disease activity as a result of combination therapy and tight control treatment"
9261640,,10.3899/jrheum.131238,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of these posthoc analyses was to evaluate short-term clinical outcomes as predictors of poor response after 1 year of treatment with combination etanercept/methotrexate (ETN/MTX) therapy versus MTX monotherapy in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Participants with moderate to severe RA [28-joint Disease Activity Score-Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 3.2] of 3-24 months' duration received ETN 50 mg weekly plus MTX or MTX monotherapy for 52 weeks. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the likelihood of remission (DAS28-ESR < 2.6) after 1 year despite poor clinical short-term treatment effects (e.g., absolute or changes from baseline in DAS28-ESR after 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 weeks of therapy).
RESULTS: The magnitude of disease activity and its improvement and timing influenced remission probability in both treatment groups; remission rate was diminished with higher disease activity levels and lower response levels over time from weeks 4 to 24. The rate of DAS28-ESR remission at 1 year was generally greater with ETN/MTX than with MTX alone at most timepoints from weeks 4 to 24. Despite persistent high disease activity (DAS28-ESR > 5.1) after 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks of therapy, 35%, 27%, 25%, and 22% of patients, respectively, in the ETN/MTX group achieved DAS28-ESR remission after 1 year of continuous treatment; the respective proportions were 33%, 27%, 8%, and 13% in the MTX group.
CONCLUSION: High disease activity and less improvement with treatment over time in the initial 24 weeks of treatment, particularly after 12 weeks, were predictive of a lower remission rate after 1 year."

Method(s): Response at week 104 was analyzed based on the attainment of remission (28-joint disease activity score [DAS28] <2.6; Boolean); low disease activity (LDA; 2.6 <=DAS28 <=3.2); normal Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score (<=0.5); or radiographic non-progression (change in modified Total Sharp Score <=0.5). Result(s): Of 208 patients with baseline DAS28 scores at week 52, 105 received ETN + MTX and 103 received ETN over weeks 52-104 (Period 2). At week 104, rates of LDA (70% vs 67%), remission (59% vs 52%), and normal HAQ-DI (63% vs 61%) were similar in both arms; week 52 responders also had a higher response rate at week 104 irrespective of treatment during Period 2. Overall rates of radiographic non-progression were higher for ETN + MTX (90%) vs ETN (74%) at week 104; week 52 non-responders in the Period 2 ETN + MTX arm had a 21-27% higher rate vs ETN, while the treatment difference was 11-12% for week 52 responders. Conclusion(s): The data suggest that for responders to ETN + MTX at week 52, MTX may be safely withdrawn. For non-responders where de-escalation would not be considered, the continuation of the combination is advisable. Radiological outcome was numerically worse, but of uncertain clinical significance.Copyright ¬© 2021 Emery et al."

In the presented Phase II COMPONENT study efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of vidofludimus in combination with methotrexate (MTX) has been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Vidofludimus has previously successfully completed a Phase IIa study in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: Primary endpoint of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study was ACR20 response at week 13. Secondary endpoints included ACR50, ACR70, DAS28, safety and pharmacokinetics. 241 patients were enrolled in two study arms across 28 sites in Eastern Europe. The first arm received 35 mg vidofludimus QD plus MTX over 13 weeks, the second arm received placebo plus MTX. Eligible patients must have had active RA, have received weekly doses of MTX (10-25 mg/week) for a minimum of 3 months prior to Day 1 dosing, and a stable MTX dose for at least 6 weeks prior to Day 1 dosing. Results: ACR20 response improvement of the vidofludimus group compared to placebo was statistically significant (p<0.05) at week 2 (16.7% vs. 6.9%) and week 8 (46.7% vs. 31.9%), but did not reach statistical significance at week 13 (50.0% vs. 44.8%). The vidofludimus group also reported higher ACR50 (25.8% vs. 17.2%) and ACR70 (12.5% vs. 6%) response rates compared to placebo at week 13. DAS28 (CRP) response rate of vidofludimus also was significantly higher compared to placebo at week 4 (55.8% vs. 42.3%). Mean change of CRP (ESR) at week 13 compared to baseline was -1.82 mg/l (-3.98 mm/h) for vidofludimus and 1.38 mg/l (3.18 mm/h) for placebo. Mean changes of RA-specific parameters (joint counts, disease activity, pain, HAQ) were similar in both groups at week 13. In contrast to preclinical interaction studies, a substantial decrease of vidofludimus plasma concentrations below levels detected in earlier clinical trials has been observed with increasing MTX doses. Vidofludimus was safe and well tolerated. No obvious differences in the adverse event profile between the vidofludimus and placebo group were observed. In particular, there were no relevant increases of diarrhea, neutropenia, anemia, hypertension, cholesterol or liver enzyme levels. Only one serious adverse event was reported in the vidofludimus group which was judged as unlikely drug-related. No deaths occurred. These safety results were consistent with previous clinical trial results in RA and IBD. Conclusion: Certain efficacy endpoints (ACR20/DAS28) have been statistically significant at specific time points during the treatment period, though vidofludimus missed the primary ACR20 efficacy endpoint of the COMPONENT study at week 13. Decreases in objective inflammatory parameters CRP and ESR strongly support a general anti-inflammatory effect of vidofludimus. These results and the very clean safety profile indicate that a vidofludimus dose of 35 mg QD might be not high enough to show statistically significant results in RA. In addition, the observed drug interaction of vidofludimus with MTX may have hampered the full anti-inflammatory activity of vidofludimus."

They randomly received oral CSA (3 mg/kg/day) or oral methotrexate (MTX) (0.15 mg/kg/week). In addition, all patients in both groups received oral prednisone (7.5 mg/day).RESULTS: fifty-two patients were assigned to the CSA group and 51 to the MTX group. After 24 months of treatment, 48 patients from the CSA group and 48 from the MTX group showed significant clinical improvement. This was evaluated by the duration of morning stiffness, grip strength, the total joint count, joint swelling, and joint tenderness and pain, compared to pre-treatment values. The clinical improvement was also associated with a significant decrease in ESR and CRP values in both groups. No significant radiological deterioration was observed in the CSA patients compared to those treated with MTX after 24 months. Four patients from the CSA group dropped out of the study, two because of a synovitis flare, one because of severe hypertrichosis and one because of severe gingival hyperplasia. Three patients from the MTX group withdrew, one because of disease flare-up and two because of gastrointestinal disturbances.CONCLUSION: early immunointervention in RA patients appears to be crucial to limit the development of joint damage. Cyclosporine A appears to be effective, well tolerated and safe in the long-term treatment of RA and can therefore be used as a first immunomodulatory drug in the armamentarium for the treatment of RA."

Over 18 months the two ""immunosuppressive"" agents produced clinical improvement comparable to that achieved with gold, and they also facilitated a reduction in the dosage of corticosteroids and retarded radiological joint deterioration. Drug management was easiest with azathioprine. Cyclophosphamide was perhaps marginally the most effective drug but it produced azoospermia in males.

Patients received 2 infusions 2 weeks apart of placebo (n = 122), rituximab 500 mg (n = 123), or rituximab 1000 mg (n = 122), with or without glucocorticoids. All patients received stable doses of methotrexate (10 25 mg/wk). Measures included SF-36, assessed at baseline and at 24 weeks, as well as the HAQ and FACIT-Fatigue scale assessed at baseline and monthly for 24 weeks. Patients exceeding prespecified minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were examined. Clinical efficacy measurements (ACR20/50/70 and EULAR responses) were compared with HRQOL outcomes.
RESULTS: At 24 weeks, the rituximab 500 mg and 1000 mg groups both reported statistically significantly greater improvements on the SF-36 physical component summary (4.37 and 4.89 points higher, respectively, vs placebo; p < 0.001).

Whilst biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD) such as tumour necrosis factor-inhibitor (TNFi) agents have revolutionised outcomes in RA, early diagnosis with immediate conventional therapy, titrated in a treat to target approach is also associated with high remission rates. The main aim of the VEDERA study (Very Early versus Delayed Etanercept in Rheumatoid Arthritis) is to assess the depth of remission, sustainability of remission and immunological normalisation induced by very early TNFi with etanercept (ETN) or standard of care +/- delayed ETN._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
METHODS/DESIGN: VEDERA is a pragmatic, phase IV single-centre open-label randomised superiority trial of 120 patients with early, treatment-naive RA. Patients will be randomised 1: 1 to first-line ETN and methotrexate (MTX) or MTX with additional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (sDMARDs) according to a treat to target (TT) protocol with further step up to ETN and MTX after 24 weeks if remission is not achieved. Participants will have regular disease activity assessments and imaging evaluation including musculoskeletal ultrasound and MRI. The main objective of this study is to assess the proportion of patients with early RA that achieve clinical remission at 48 weeks, following either treatment strategy. In addition, the participants are invited to take part in a cardio-vascular sub-study (Coronary Artery Disease in RA, CADERA), which aims to identify the incidence of cardiovascular abnormalities in early RA._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

We have recruited 120 patients with RA with a high disease activity despite being treated with MTX (15 mg/week) or LEF (20 mg/die) for 3 months, without side effects. In each of these patients, therapy with either MTX or LEF was continued and randomly combined with an anti-TNF-alpha drug: etanercept, infliximab, or adalimumab. Patients were assessed at study entry and at 4, 12, and at 24 weeks. The efficacy endpoints included variations in the DAS28-ESR and the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses. At each visit, any side-effect was recorded. There were no statistically significant differences in the DAS28 variations and in the ACR responses between the two groups or among the six subgroups. The number of discontinuation due to the appearance of serious side effects was higher, but not statistically significant, in the LEF-anti-TNF-alpha group than in the MTX-anti-TNF-alpha group. Other adverse events that did not necessitate the discontinuation of therapy occurred much more frequently in patients treated with MTX than in those treated with LEF. Anti-TNF-alpha drugs can be used in combination not only with MTX, but also with LEF, with the same probability of achieving significant clinical improvement in RA patients and without a significantly greater risk of serious adverse events. In contrast, it seems that combination therapy with LEF-anti-TNF-alpha is more readily tolerated than combination therapy with MTX-anti-TNF-alpha."

9260707,,10.3899/jrheum.100752,"OBJECTIVE: This Year 5 analysis of an open-label extension (OLE) study assessed radiographic progression, clinical efficacy, and safety of adalimumab with concomitant methotrexate (MTX) for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: In a double-blind study (DE019, NCT00195702), inadequate responders to MTX were randomized to MTX plus either adalimumab 40 mg eow, adalimumab 20 mg weekly, or placebo for 52 weeks. Eligible patients entered an ongoing OLE and received adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MTX. Longterm efficacy and safety were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 457 patients who had enrolled in the OLE, 304 remained in the study at Year 5, including 112, 107, and 85 from the original adalimumab 40 mg, adalimumab 20 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Year 5 radiographs demonstrated mean changes in modified total Sharp score for the original adalimumab 40 mg eow and 20 mg weekly groups of 0.8 and 2.6, respectively, versus 3.9 for placebo; 58% from the adalimumab 40 mg eow group had no radiographic progression versus 40% of those who initially received placebo. Of patients who received adalimumab 40 mg eow for 5 years, 26.1% achieved clinical remission (Disease Activity Score 28-joint count < 2.6), had no radio graphic progression (change in modified total Sharp score ‚Äö√¢¬ß 0.5), and had normal function (Health Assessment Questionnaire ‚Äö√¢¬ß 0.5), versus 11.9% of those who initially received placebo. Serious infection rate for 553 patients who received at least one dose of adalimumab was 4.4/100 patient-years.

METHODS: DE019 was a 1-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which patients received adalimumab 20 mg weekly, adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow), or placebo; all received concomitant MTX. Patients completing the RCT could receive open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow + MTX for an additional 9 years. Clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes were assessed using composite measures of disease activity (e.g., American College of Rheumatology responses, 28-joint Disease Activity Score with C-reactive protein, Simplified Disease Activity Index), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, and the modified total Sharp score (mTSS), respectively.
RESULTS: Of the 619 patients randomized, 457 entered the open-label extension; 202 completed 10 years. At Year 10, patients demonstrated effective disease control and inhibition of radiographic progression. Differences in clinical and functional responses between adalimumab + MTX and placebo + MTX observed during the RCT became less apparent at Year 10. Still, patients who initially received adalimumab + MTX had significantly lower mean ≈í√ÆmTSS at Year 10 compared with patients who initially received placebo + MTX. No new safety signals arose following up to 10 years of adalimumab + MTX exposure.
CONCLUSION: During up to 10 years of treatment with adalimumab + MTX, patients with longstanding RA experienced effective disease control with no change to the expected safety profile. A 1-year delay in receipt of adalimumab + MTX was associated with reduced effectiveness, suggesting that a window of opportunity to prevent irreversible damage exists even in a population with established RA."

Observed data analyses were performed for all patients who received >=1 dose of study drug and had data at each visit. Clinical response was assessed using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and swollen and tender joint counts (SJC66 and TJC68). Remission-like response was defined as 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) < 2.6, SJC66=0, TJC68=0, or DAS28 < 2.6 and radiographic nonprogression. Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Two experts blinded to sequence and order read radiographic films from baseline and Years 5, 6, and 8.

However, long term safety, cost effectiveness and feasibility in clinical practice remain uncertain.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a 18-months pragmatic, non-inferiority, cost minimalisation, randomized controlled trial on dose reduction and discontinuation of the subcutaneous tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers adalimumab and etanercept in RA patients with low disease activity. 180 RA patients with low disease activity (DAS28 < 3.2 or clinical judgment of the rheumatologist) are randomized 2:1 to either increased spacing and eventually discontinuation after 6 months of the TNF blocker, and usual care. Implementation is done in routine daily care, using treat to target and feedback implementation in both treatment arms. The primary outcome is non-inferiority (NI margin 20%) in cumulative incidence of persistent (> 3 months) RA flare, according to a recently validated DAS28 based flare criterion (DAS28 change > 1.2, or DAS28 increase of 0.6 and current DAS28 ‚â• 3.2). Secondary outcomes include mean disease activity, function, radiographic progression, safety and cost effectiveness. Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) differences between groups are expressed as a decremental cost effectiveness ratio (DCER), i.e. saved costs divided by (possible) loss in QALY.
DISCUSSION: The design of this study targeted several clinical and methodological issues on TNF blocker dose de-escalation, including how to taper the TNF blockers, the satisfactory control condition, how to define flare, implementation in clinical practice, and the choice of the non-inferiority margin. Pragmatic cost minimalisation studies using non-inferiority designs and DCERs will become more mainstream as cost effectiveness in healthcare gains importance.

DESIGN: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority strategy trial. SETTING: two rheumatology outpatient clinics in the netherlands, from december 2011 to may 2014. PARTICIPANTS: 180 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and low disease activity using adalimumab or etanercept; 121 allocated to the dose reduction strategy, 59 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS: disease activity guided dose reduction (advice to stepwise increase the injection interval every three months, until flare of disease activity or discontinuation) or usual care (no dose reduction advice). Flare was defined AS increase in DAS28-CRP (a composite score measuring disease activity) greater than 1.2, or increase greater than 0.6 and current score of at least 3.2. In the case of flare, TNF inhibitor use was restarted or escalated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: difference in proportions of patients with major flare (DAS28-CRP based flare longer than three months) between the two groups at 18 months, compared against a non-inferiority margin of 20%. Secondary outcomes included TNF inhibitor use at study end, functioning, quality of life, radiographic progression, and adverse events. RESULTS: dose reduction of adalimumab or etanercept was non-inferior to usual care (proportion of patients with major flare at 18 months, 12% v 10%; difference 2%, 95% confidence interval -12% to 12%). In the dose reduction group, TNF inhibitor use could successfully BE stopped in 20% (95% confidence interval 13% to 28%), the injection interval successfully increased in 43% (34% to 53%), but no dose reduction was possible in 37% (28% to 46%). Functional status, quality of life, relevant radiographic progression, and adverse events did not differ between the groups, although short lived flares (73% v 27%) and minimal radiographic progression (32% v 15%) were more frequent in dose reduction than usual care. CONCLUSIONS: a disease activity guided, dose reduction strategy of adalimumab or etanercept to treat rheumatoid arthritis is non-inferior to usual care with regard to major flaring, while resulting in the successful dose reduction or stopping in two thirds of patients.trial registration dutch trial register (www.trialregister.nl), NTR 3216."

A total of 103 early RA patients, without prior use of DMARDs, were randomized to receive CsA (3 mg/kg per day) or methotrexate (MTX) (0.15 mg/kg per week). In addition, all patients received prednisone (7.5 mg/day). After 42 months of treatment, pairs of hand and wrist radiographs of 41 patients treated with CsA and 42 treated with MTX were evaluated blindly and separately by two investigators, using reference radiographs for scoring. A scale scoring similar to Larsen's standard radiographs with minor modifications was used. The studied radiographs were obtained at the beginning and 42 months after therapy in both groups. Patients in both groups responded beneficially to the above treatment regimens. In the CsA group, 37 patients (71 %) remained radiographically stable and 4 worsened, while in the MTX group 39 patients (76%) remained stable and 3 deteriorated. No significant radiological worsening was found in the CsA-treated patients as compared to those treated with MTX. Early immuno-intervention in RA patients appears to be crucial for the future development of joint damage: CsA can delay radiological disease progression and may inhibit joint damage deterioration in early RA patients."

The conventional therapeutic dosing scheme is a loading dose of 100 mg/day for 3 days followed by 20 mg/day thereafter. Eliminating the 3-day loading dose may decrease the risk of adverse effects, most of Rheumatologists don't use the loading dose any more. Objective. To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Leflunomide (LFN) 100mg/week compared to Methotrexate (MTX) 10mg/week in a randomized, controlled trial with 26 weeks of follow up in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. Patients and Methods. 40 Libyan Patients who met The 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA and presented with active disease were included. All patients had medical records, including laboratory tests and hand X-rays. Clinical evaluations for improvement and ACR and EULAR response criteria were performed. Statistical analysis for independent's samples between both groups defined a p value of <=.05. Safety was evaluated by comparing the proportion of adverse events (AE) registered. Results. 40 patients were screened and randomized: 20 patients received 100 mg LFN weekly and 20 patients received MTX 10 mg per week, all received 10mg prednisone daily for two weeks followed by 5mg for another 4 weeks, NSAIDs were allowed during the entire study period on demand, all patients had regular follow up for 26 weeks. All 40 patients completed the study.. ACR20 improvement criteria were achieved by LFN group in 100%, and in 95% by the MTX group at week 26, ACR 50 improvement was achieved in 90% of both groups, ACR 70 in 80% in the LEF group and 75% in the MTX group at the end of the study. At the beginning of the study DAS28 was 5.85 and improved to3.07 in the LFN group versus 5,92 and 3.22 in the MTX group. AE for each group was 1 patient in the LFN group, and 2 patients in the MTX group. Regarding safety, no serious AE of a life threatening nature were reported. Conclusion. Leflunomide 100 mg weekly is adequately effective and safe as 10 mg Methotrexate per week in the treatment of active Rheumatoid Arthritis after 26 weeks of follow up"

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous tocilizumab or abatacept treatment. History taking, clinical examination, and laboratory evaluation were done at baseline and during a 24-week period of follow-up. Disease activity was calculated using the DAS28-ESR score. The incidence of accompanying adverse events was evaluated and all statistical analyses were performed by InStat., RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients were enrolled and classified randomly into the tocilizumab (n = 68) and abatacept (n = 64) groups. By week 24, the mean DAS28-ESR was significantly reduced in both groups (P < 0.0001) in association with significant reductions in CRP, ESR, and HAQ scores. No significant difference in the incidence rate of adverse effects appeared between both study groups. However, there were marked declines in the hemoglobin levels (P = 0.003) and neutrophil count (P = 0.002) together with significant elevations in systolic blood pressure (P = 0.002), liver enzymes (P = 0.001), total cholesterol (P = 0.001), and high-density lipoproteins (P = 0.002) in the tocilizumab group compared with the abatacept group., CONCLUSION: Both intravenous abatacept and tocilizumab significantly decreased the disease activity and improved the physical function in rheumatoid arthritis patients who failed to respond to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Although the efficacy of both drugs was similar, abatacept showed a more promising short-term safety profile since it was associated with less adverse effects and better laboratory outcomes."

Methods: Patients with MTX-IR received placebo up to week (W)24 or FIL200 mg, FIL100 mg, or adalimumab up to W52; all received MTX. Efficacy and safety data were stratified by four PPFs versus fewer than four PPFs: seropositivity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) ‚â• 6 mg/L, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints with CRP > 5.1, and erosions on X-rays. Results: At baseline, 687/1755 patients had four PPFs. At W12, whether with four PPFs or fewer than four PPFs, response rates on all American College of Rheumatology (ACR) measures were significantly greater with FIL200 and FIL100 versus placebo. At W52, FIL200 ACR20/50/70 response rates remained at least numerically higher versus adalimumab in both subgroups. At W52, FIL200 reduced modified total Sharp score (mTSS) change versus adalimumab in patients with four or fewer than four PPFs. Conclusions: In high-risk (four PPFs) patients with MTX-IR RA, FIL200 and FIL100 showed similar reductions in disease activity versus placebo at W12 as in patients with fewer than four PPFs. mTSS in patients receiving FIL200 changed little from W24 to W52, while that in patients receiving FIL100 progressed comparably to patients who received adalimumab. Tolerability was comparable across treatment arms and subgroups."

Methods: Methotrexate (MTX)-na√Øve patients received filgotinib 200 or 100 mg plus MTX (FIL200+MTX, FIL100+MTX), filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy (FIL200), or MTX monotherapy through 52 weeks (NCT02886728). Patients with inadequate response (IR) to MTX (MTX-IR) received FIL200+MTX, FIL100+MTX, adalimumab 40 mg +MTX (ADA+MTX), or placebo (PBO)+MTX (rerandomized to FIL200+MTX or FIL100+MTX at week 24) through 52 weeks (NCT02889796). Patients with IR to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD-IR) received FIL200 or FIL100 or PBO with background stable conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs for up to 24 weeks (NCT02873936). PROs included Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical/mental component summary (PCS/MCS), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Rheumatoid Arthritis (WPAI-RA), and Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGA). Data are reported as least-squares mean changes from baseline with standard error to the timepoint representing each study‚Äôs primary endpoint. All statistical comparisons are of filgotinib groups vs their respective control groups. Results: At week 24, among MTX-na√Øve patients, change from baseline (standard deviation) in HAQ-DI was ‚àí 1.00 (0.03; P < 0.001) with FIL200+MTX, ‚àí 0.94 (0.04; P < 0.01) with FIL100+MTX, and ‚àí 0.91 (0.04; P < 0.05) with FIL200 alone compared with ‚àí 0.81 (0.03) with MTX alone. At week 12, among MTX-IR patients, change from baseline in HAQ-DI was ‚àí 0.69 (0.04; P < 0.001 vs PBO+MTX, P < 0.05 vs ADA) with FIL200+MTX, ‚àí 0.57 (0.04; P < 0.001 vs placebo) with FIL100+MTX, and ‚àí 0.60 (0.04) with ADA vs ‚àí 0.40 (0.04) with PBO+MTX. At week 12, among bDMARD-IR patients, change from baseline in HAQ-DI was ‚àí 0.50 (0.06; P < 0.001) with FIL200+csDMARD and ‚àí 0.46 (0.05; P < 0.001) with FIL100+csDMARD vs ‚àí 0.19 (0.06) with placebo+csDMARD. Changes in SF-36 PCS and MCS, FACIT-Fatigue, WPAI, and PtGA tended to favor filgotinib over PBO, MTX, and ADA. Greater proportions of patients experienced clinically meaningful differences with either dosage of FIL in combination with csDMARDs (including MTX) and with FIL200 monotherapy vs comparators. Conclusions: Filgotinib provided improvements in PROs across patient populations. These findings suggest filgotinib can be an effective treatment option for patients with insufficient response to MTX or bDMARDs and patients who are MTX-na√Øve.

METHODS: metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint PDUS was assessed in 23 patients with RA, alongside arthroscopic synovitis and oxygen tension measurements, at baseline and 4 weeks after anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.
RESULTS: anti-TNF reduced PDUS scores, which were negatively correlated with rise in oxygen tensions. The latter was related to good EULAR response at week 52.
CONCLUSIONS: anti-TNF results in rapid reduction in synovial blood flow, with a corresponding rise in oxygen tension most marked in EULAR good responders."

The aim of this analysis was to characterize the relationship between tofacitinib dose and efficacy, as measured by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates, and to compare this between Japanese and Western patients with RA. Efficacy data were pooled from 2 double-blind, dose-ranging phase 2 studies of tofacitinib monotherapy 1-15 mg twice daily in patients with RA with an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). NCT00550446 was carried out in mostly Western patients and NCT00687193 in Japanese patients. ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates in week 12 were analyzed using maximum drug effect (Emax ) models on the logit domain. Both studies showed a dose-response for each end point, supporting the efficacy of tofacitinib in patients with inadequate response to DMARDs. Study-specific differences in Emax were noted, whereas potency (dose providing half the maximum effect [ED50 ]) was similar across studies. After adjustment for study differences in Emax by calculating the fractions of the maximum placebo-adjusted proportion of ACR responses, the estimated locations for the 5- and 10-mg twice-daily doses on the dose-response curves were similar for the 2 patient populations: ACR20, ACR50, andACR70 mean fractional responses for 5 and 10 mg twice daily were 0.78, 0.43, 0.32 and 0.90, 0.69, and 0.56, respectively, for the Japanese study and 0.54, 0.41, and 0.22 and 0.73, 0.61, and 0.40, respectively, for the Western study. This analysis therefore supports the rationale for the same dosing regimen in Japanese patients as in Western patients from an efficacy perspective. Copyright ¬¨¬© 2019 Pfizer Inc.

The results suggest a relationship between a fall in lymphocyte activity and clinical improvement on GST. They also show that the patients with most active disease, as determined by the ESR, had normal levels of lymphocyte activity. We suggest that peripheral lymphocyte activity is secondary to immunological stimulation in the joint capsule, and is not directly related to disease activity. We conclude that spontaneous activity is probably an epiphenomenon and not related directly to disease activity or to disease prognosis."

Study was done at Rheumatology Clinic of University Clinical Centre in Prishtina during 2009-2011 years.
METHODS: We evaluated primary efficacy and safety at 24 weeks in patients enrolled in the study of long-term efficacy of Rituximab and Etanercept. Patients with active Rheumatoid Arthritis and an inadequate response to 1 or more non biologic DMARDS were randomized to receive intravenous Rituximab (1 course consisting of 2 infusions of 1.000 mg each -one group, and Etanercept 25 mg twice weekly -second group, but both groups with background MTX. The primary efficacy end point was a response on the ACR 20%, improvement criteria at 24 weeks, Secondary end points were responses on the ACR 50 and ACR 70, improvement criteria, the DAS 28, and EULAR response criteria at 24 weeks.
RESULTS: During our investigations we treated 20 patients, 15 females and 5 males, in the treated group with RTX and 13 patients 8 females and 5 males in the treated group with ETN. Patients of group 1 and group 2 were of ages 37-69 years old and 19-69 years old (average 47-44) Most of the patients belong in 2nd and 3rd functional stage according to Steinbrocker. All ACR response parameters were significantly improved in RTX treated patients who also had clinically meaningful improvement in fatigue, disability and quality of life. Patients showed a trend less progression in radiographic end points. Most adverse events occurred with the first RTX infusion and were mild to moderate severity.
CONCLUSION: At 24 weeks, a single course of RTX and ETN provided significant and clinically meaningful improvements in disease activity in patients with active, longstanding RA who had an inadequate response to 1 or more nonbiologic DMARDS."

Methods: we examined 47 patients with RA, 19 men and 28 women, mean age 51.60+/-5.62 y, midscore of DAS28 is 2.78 +/-0.35, randomized into 2 groups. As basic therapy 20 patients (42.55 %) received methotrexate 7.5-15 mg/week, 23 patients (48.94 %) combined methotrexate with glucocorticoids 5- 10 mg/d, 4 patients (8.51 %) received leflunomide 20 mg/d. Patients of the first group (n=23) along with basic therapy were treated with osteogenon, the second group (n=24) basic therapy and calcium with vitamin D. The average level of BMD in first group was 0.959+/-0.031, in second group 0.962+/-0.033. Pain syndrome was assessed according to visual analogue scale before treatment and after 1, 3 and 6 months. BMD was determined by DXA. Results: pain decreased by 35.4 % (p<0.05) in the group of patients receiving osteogenon and in the group receiving standard combination of calcium and vitamin D to 9.1 % (p<0.05). Bone mineral density increased in the group receiving osteogenon (+6.9 %, p<0.001) after 6 months of treatment, in contrast to second group, in which was not observed reliable dynamic (+1.35 %, p>0.05). Conclusion: more significant improvement ofBMD was registered in first group in comparison with a group of patients that received the standard combination of calcium with vitamin D at recommended doses. In this way ossein hydroxyapatite complex can be recommended as a first line medicine for treatment of osteoporosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis"

Method(s): This was a prospective, non-interventional, multi-center study conducted in RA, PsA and axSpA patients initiating golimumab between April 2016 and May 2020 in 40 centers in Austria. WPAI, HRQoL (RAQoL, ankylosing spondylitis (AS)QoL and PsAQoL) questionnaires and disease activity (Clinical Disease Activity Index, CDAI, in RA and PsA; Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, BASDAI, in axSpA) were assessed at baseline and months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24. Association between WPAI and disease activity was tested using linear regression. Result(s): We enrolled 233 patients (RA, n = 95; axSpA, n = 69; PsA, n = 69), 110 patients were followed up to month 24. Mean age was 50.2 +/- 14.2 years; 64% were female. Disease activity decreased from baseline to month 24 (RA: CDAI -24.3 +/- 13.5; axSpA: BASDAI -4.4 +/- 2.1, and PsA: CDAI -21.7 +/- 8.5, p < 0.0001, each). Total work productivity impairment (TWPI), activity impairment and presenteeism subscores continuously decreased throughout month 24 in all indications: RA (-58.3 +/- 23%, -62.6 +/- 23.8% and -61.7 +/- 23.3%, respectively as compared to baseline; p < 0.0001, each), axSpA (-34.4 +/- 38.3%, p = 0.0117; -60.9 +/- 25.9%, and -43.8 +/- 26.6%, respectively, p <= 0.0001 both) and PsA (-35.8 +/- 43.7%, p = 0.0186; -52.3 +/- 25.4%, p < 0.0001; and -43.3 +/- 33.5%, p = 0.0007, respectively). Absenteeism scores decreased only in RA patients (-9.2 +/- 24.9%, p = 0.0234). HRQoL improved between baseline and month 24 (RAQoL: -12.6 +/- 7.5; ASQoL: -8.0 +/- 4.3; PsAQoL; -8.3 +/- 6.4, p < 0.0001, each).

9740984,,10.3899/jrheum.110570,"Golimumab is a fully human protein (antibody) which binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa). TNFa is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and plays a major role in causing the joint pain, swelling and damage from RA. Other marketed drugs that target TNFa (anti-TNFa drugs) have been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms, signs and joint damage of RA, but have limitations with respect to safety and ease of use. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of a new anti-TNFa drug, golimumab, at 2 doses, injected under the skin every 4 weeks in subjects with active RA previously treated with at least 1 dose of a biologic anti-TNFa agent (etanercept, adalimumab or infliximab). Concomitant therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine is permitted if the subject has tolerated these medications for at least 12 weeks prior to the first administration of study drug and is on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent. The study hypothesis is that golimumab will be a safe and effective treatment for RA in subjects with active RA previously treated with at least one biologic anti-TNFa agent as measured by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) responses and the change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), without causing unacceptable significant adverse effects. The ACR response criteria were designed to assess the level of improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA. The DAS28 responses also measure improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA using the joint examination and laboratory testing. The HAQ is a series of questions that measure a subject's impairment in physical function caused by RA. Patients will receive golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo injections under the skin every 4 weeks until Week 24. After Week 24, all subjects receive golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg injections, and golimumab continues for all groups every 4 weeks for about 4 and a half more years."

METHODS: serum samples from 152 MTX-naive adults with active RA who received placebo + MTX (n = 37) or golimumab (combined 50 mg + MTX or 100 mg ¬± MTX; n = 115) were analyzed for selected markers of inflammation and bone/cartilage turnover. One hundred patients were randomly selected for additional protein profiling using multianalyte profiles (HumanMap v1.6, Rules Based Medicine). Radiographs at baseline, Week 28, and Week 52 were scored using van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) methodology. Correlations were assessed between biomarker levels (baseline and change at Week 4) and joint space narrowing, erosion, and total vdH-S scores (changes at Weeks 28 and 52). Statistical significance was defined as a correlation coefficient with an absolute value ‚â• 0.3 and p < 0.05.
RESULTS: biomarker correlations with changes in vdH-S scores at Week 28 and/or 52 were observed predominantly in the placebo + MTX group and rarely in the combined golimumab treatment group. Changes in epidermal growth factor (EGF) and CD40 ligand (CD40L) at Week 4 were positively correlated with changes in total vdH-S scores at Weeks 28 and 52 in the placebo + MTX group.
CONCLUSION: these preliminary findings indicate that EGF and CD40L may have utility in monitoring MTX-treated patients with RA who are more likely to have radiographic progression as measured by increases in vdH-S scores."

Methods: The GO-BEFORE trial studied GLM 50mg and 100mg + MTX in MTX-naive patients. In the overall GO-BEFORE study population, patients exhibited lower disease activity (baseline ACR components and DAS28) than was observed in previous studies of biologic agents in MTX-naive patients1. This is a retrospective analysis of GO-BEFORE wk 52 data which compares efficacy outcomes in subsets of RA patients with severe, active disease to the overall study population. 637 MTX-naive pts were randomized to PBO+MTX (Grp 1), GLM 100mg+PBO (Grp 2), GLM 50mg+MTX (Grp 3), or GLM 100mg+MTX (Grp 4).

Subcutaneous (SC) GOL (50 mg or 100 mg every 4 weeks) was evaluated in phase 3 trials of patients with active RA, PsA, and AS. Safety data through Year 5 were pooled across 3 RA trials , 1 PsA trial, and 1 AS trial. Data summarized was derived from both placebo-controlled (through weeks 24-52) and uncontrolled study periods. For adverse events (AE) of special interest [serious infections (SI), opportunistic infections (OI), deaths, malignancies, demyelination, tuberculosis (TB)], incidence per 100 patient-years (pt-yrs) was determined. Results. Across all trials, 639 patients received placebo and 2228 received SC GOL 50 mg only (n = 671), 50 mg and 100 mg (n = 765), or 100 mg only (n = 792). Safety followup extended for averages of 28.5 and 203.2 weeks for placebo and GOL, respectively. Respective placebo and GOL AE incidence/100 pt-yrs (95% CI) through Year 5 were 4.86 (2.83-7.78) and 3.29 (2.92-3.69) for SI, 0.00 (0.00-0.86) and 0.23 (0.14-0.35) for TB, 0.00 (0.00-0.86) and 0.22 (0.13-0.34) for OI, 0.00 (0.00-0.86) and 0.10 (0.05-0.20) for lymphoma, 0.00 (0.00-0.86) and 0.08 (0.03-0.17) for demyelination, and 0.29 (0.01-1.59) and 0.41 (0.29-0.57) for death. TB, OI, lymphoma, and demyelination incidence appeared to be higher among patients receiving GOL 100 mg only. Conclusion. SC GOL safety through Year 5 remained consistent with previously reported Year 3 findings and with other TNF antagonists. Numerically higher incidences of TB, OI, lymphoma, and demyelination were observed with 100 mg versus 50 mg.

In treatment for RA, it has been recommended to assess the clinical disease activity at least every 3 months according to the treat to target (T2T) recommendation. Therefore, predictors of long-term efficacy with GLM treatment using clinical data at baseline and 3 months would seem to be extremely important. Objective To assess the predictability of using clinical data at baseline and week 12 (W12) after GLM treatment in GO-FORTH study, for achievement of each remission criteria after 1-year. Methods: GO-FORTH was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in pts with active RA despite MTX therapy. Pts were randomized to Placebo (PBO), GLM50 mg or GLM 100 mg q4 wks combined with MTX (6-8 mg/ week). Data of all pts who were randomized to GLM 50 mg or GLM 100mg as active treatment were used for analysis. Several definitions of remission at week 52 (W52) were used and defined as: DAS remission (DAS28ESR <2.6), HAQ remission (HAQ <0.5) and radiographic remission (+TMTSS <=0). Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) were calculated to assess predictability with all possible predictors using univariate logistic regression model. Area under the curves (AUC) were calculated to assess the performance of possible predictors using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Cutoff values were also calculated using Euclidean method. The correlations between possible predictors were carefully considered to determine predictor. Results: DAS28ESR score at W12 was chosen based on the values of AIC as a possible predictor of DAS remission at W52. HAQ score at W12 was also chosen as a possible predictor of HAQ remission at W52. Similar trends were observed in the both scores at baseline. The cutoff point (AUC) of DAS28ESR for DAS remission with GLM 50 mg and GLM 100 mg at W12 were 3.0 (0.876) and 3.5 (0.863), then cutoff point of HAQ score for HAQ remission with them were 0.625 (0.880) and 0.500 (0.958), respectively (see table). The results of baseline and PPVs/ NPVs for each determined predictors were also calculated as table shown. Both potential predictors showed larger AUC and smaller cutoff values at W12 than those at the baseline. There were no noticeable differences between GLM 50mg and GLM 100mg in the potential predictors. Predictors for radiographic remission were not specified by this analysis. Conclusion: These analyses suggest that DAS28ESR and HAQ score at baseline and W12 can be predictors for DAS remission and HAQ remission at W52 in Japanese pts treated with GLM combined with MTX individually. In particular in terms of DAS remission, it seems to be important to achieve LDA within 3 months to maintain long term clinical remission. (Table Presented)."

Nineteen patients were enrolled; 9 were randomized to the placebo (PBO) + methotrexate (MTX), GLM 50 mg + MTX, or GLM 100 mg + MTX therapy group; and 10 were randomized to the PBO, GLM 50 mg, or GLM 100 mg therapy group. One patient in the GLM 100 mg + MTX therapy group with median values from the GO-FORTH study was added. Data were evaluated by assessing the changes in DAS28-ESR, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and total Sharp score (TSS) at week 52. Mean changes in DAS28-ESR in the MTX monotherapy, GLM 50 mg + MTX, GLM 100 mg + MTX, PBO, GLM 50 mg, and GLM 100 mg therapy groups were -2.70, -2.57, -2.27, -0.60, -2.53, and -2.53, respectively; the mean improvements in HAQ-DI were 0.188, 0.708, 0.377, 0.188, 1.042, and 0.625, respectively. The mean changes in TSS were 1.63, -0.33, -1.17, 4.25, 1.00, and 1.67, respectively. A significant difference was only observed in the mean TSS change between the PBO + MTX and the GLM 100 mg + MTX groups. However, in terms of mean changes in DAS28-ESR in the combination therapy groups, PBO + MTX therapy seemed to elicit similar results as the GLM 50 mg + MTX and GLM 100 mg + MTX therapies (no significant difference) because all four patients in the PBO + MTX therapy group may have received GLM from week 24 as a crossover. Combined GLM + MTX therapy reduced disease activity and strongly inhibited radiographic disease progression in patients with active RA at week 52."

METHODS: in the multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled GO-FORWARD study, 444 adults with active RA despite MTX received subcutaneous placebo + MTX (crossover to golimumab 50 mg at Week 24), golimumab 100 mg + placebo, golimumab 50 mg + MTX, or golimumab 100 mg + MTX every 4 weeks. Physical function and general health were assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS, MCS) scores of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36), respectively, through Week 52. Fatigue was measured through Week 24 using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) questionnaire.
RESULTS: mean improvements from baseline in HAQ-DI, SF-36 PCS, and FACIT-Fatigue scores (Weeks 14 and 24) were significantly greater for golimumab 50 mg + MTX and 100 mg + MTX versus placebo + MTX.

The blind was maintained through the 52-week database lock, after which treatment adjustments were permitted. Adverse events (AE) were monitored through week 268. Efficacy was evaluated using the american college of rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 responses and a 28-joint disease activity score using c-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP). Response rates at week 256 were analyzed by an intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: a total of 444 patients were randomized, and 313 received GOL through week 252; 301 patients completed the safety followup through week 268. Infections were the most common type of AE; 172 patients (39.6%) had ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 1 serious AE. No unexpected safety signals were observed. At week 256, ACR20/50/70 responses were achieved by 63.1%, 40.8%, and 24.1%, respectively, of all randomized patients. About 78% of all patients achieved a good or moderate DAS28-CRP response.

Methods: 444 pts with active RA (2 4 TJC and 24 SJC) despite MTX were randomized to PBO+MTX, GLM 100 mg+PBO, GLM 50 mg+MTX, or GLM 100 mg+MTX q4 wks through wk48. At wk16, any pt with <20% improvement from baseline in SJC & TJC entered early escape (EE) in a double-blinded fashion such that PBO+MTX received GLM 50mg+MTX, MTX was added for GLM 100 mg+PBO, and GLM 50 mg+MTX received GLM 100 mg+MTX; dosing for GLM 100 mg+MTX was unchanged. PBO+MTX crossed over to GLM 50 mg+MTX at wk24. Physical function was assessed using HAQ disability index and SF-36 PCS score. HRQoL was assessed using the PCS and MCS scores of the SF-36. Productivity was assessed on a 10-cm VAS. An ANOVA on van der Waerden normal scores was performed for between-group comparisons at wk24. At wk52, observed efficacy was summarized; no treatment grp comparisons were performed. Results: Mean baseline HAQ scores indicated moderate functional impairment; PCS scores were lower than US population norm (50+/-10). GLM+MTX was significantly better than PBO+MTX in improving physical function, HRQoL, productivity, and time lost from work by pt (50 mg only) at wk24 (p<0.05). Through wk24, there were no statistically significant improvements in employability, time lost from work by caregiver or healthcare resource consumption. Improvements in HAQ, PCS, MCS, and productivity observed at wk24 were sustained/enhanced through wk52. By wk52, approx 75% of pts receiving GLM 50 or 100 mg+MTX achieved improvement in baseline HAQ >= 0.25 and mean changes in productivity ranged from -2.4 to -2.7 across GLM grps. Time lost from work by pts and caregivers decreased from wks24-52.

In this sub-analysis of GO-FURTHER, we compare the safety, efficacy, prednisone use, and discontinuation rates in patients age <65 years vs those >65 years through 2 years of treatment with intravenous (IV) golimumab (GLM) plus methotrexate (MTX) in an open-label extension of a Phase III trial of pts with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite MTX therapy. Methods: in this Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled GO-FURTHER trial, 592 patients with active RA were randomized (2: 1) to IV GLM 2 mg/kg plus MTX (Group 1) or placebo (PBO) plus MTX (Group 2) at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks thereafter. PBO patients crossed over to GLM at week 16 (early escape) or week 24 (crossover by design). The final GLM infusion was at week 100. Assessments included ACR 20/50/70 response criteria. Safety was monitored through week 112. Results: in total randomized patients, 523 patients aged <65 years and 69 patients >65 years were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population with last observation carried forward through week 100. Clinical response by ACR 20/50/70, respectively, was observed in 62%, 34.2%, and 17.5% of those <65 years at week 24 (primary endpoint) and was similar (67.9%, 39.6%, and 17%) in those >65 years of age. The ACR response rates were significantly higher (p<0.001) in GLM+MTX group compared with the PBO + MTX group in both age groups. At week 52 and week 100, ACR 20/50/70 values for patients <65 years and patients >65 years remained similar to those at week 24 (Table). Mean baseline prednisone dose (mg) was higher in the <65 (7.04+/-2.47) vs the >65 years age group (6.76+/-2.69). Discontinuation rates were similar among patients aged <65 years who received PBO + MTX and GLM + MTX, respectively, at week 24 (2.8% vs 2.9%). Among patients >65 years, discontinuation rates were higher in the GLM + MTX group vs PBO + MTX, respectively, at week 24 (11.3% vs 6.3%). The 2 most common reasons for discontinuation in both age groups for PBO + MTX and GLM + MTX were adverse events and withdrawal of consent. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were numerically higher in patients aged >65 years (26.4%) vs those <65 years (18.7%) with infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and fractures being the most commonly reported events in the >65 years age group. Conclusion: clinical response to IV GLM + MTX were significantly higher than PBO + MTX in both age groups and the response was maintained through week 100 in those patients who were <65 years and those >65 years. Mean prednisone dose was slightly higher in patients <65 years, but prednisone use based on percentage was similar in both groups. SAEs were higher in patients >65 years vs <65 years, but no increase in unexpected events was observed in those >65 years. These data suggest IV GLM + MTX treatment in patients >65 years is not associated with loss of clinical response or an increase in unexpected adverse events vs patients <65 years. (Table Presented)"

METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial, adults with RA were randomly assigned to receive IV placebo (n = 197) or golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 395) infusions at Week 0, Week 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. All patients continued stable oral MTX (15-25 mg/wk). HRQOL assessments included Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI; physical function), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 questionnaire physical/mental component summary (SF-36 PCS/MCS) scores, EQ-5D assessment of current health state, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) questionnaire, and disease effect on productivity [10-cm visual analog scale (VAS)].
RESULTS: Mean HAQ-DI improvements from baseline were significantly greater with golimumab + MTX than placebo + MTX at Week 14 and Week 24 (p < 0.001). Significantly greater improvements in all 8 individual SF-36 subscores and both the SF-36 PCS and MCS scores (p < 0.001) also accompanied golimumab + MTX therapy. Improved EQ-5D and EQ-5D VAS (p < 0.001) and FACIT-Fatigue (p < 0.001) scores were also observed for golimumab + MTX-treated patients at Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24, and greater proportions of golimumab + MTX-treated patients had clinically meaningful improvements in these measures. Greater reductions in disease effect on productivity were observed with golimumab + MTX versus placebo + MTX at Week 24 (p < 0.001). Improvements in physical function, HRQOL, fatigue, and productivity significantly correlated with disease activity improvement.
CONCLUSION: In active RA, IV golimumab + MTX significantly improved physical function, HRQOL, fatigue, and productivity using multiple measurement tools; all correlated with improvements in disease activity (NCT00973479, EudraCT 2008-006064-11)."

We analyzed pooled safety results from three phase 3 IV golimumab trials in these rheumatologic diseases and hypothesized that the safety profile of IV golimumab would be similar to that established for other TNFi, including subcutaneous golimumab. Methods: Data from three double-blind, randomized trials of IV golimumab in patients with RA, PsA, and AS, each with a placebo-controlled period and an extension of active treatment, were included. Golimumab 2 mg/kg was administered at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks through week 100 (RA) or week 52 (PsA, AS). Concomitant low-dose, oral corticosteroids were permitted. Concomitant methotrexate was required in the RA trial and permitted in the PsA and AS trials; placebo patients crossed over to golimumab at weeks 24 (RA, PsA) and 16 (AS), respectively. Adverse events (AEs), including infections, serious infections, malignancies, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), were assessed through week 112 (RA) or week 60 (PsA, AS). Results: In total, 539 patients were randomized to placebo, and 740 patients were randomized to golimumab; 1248 patients received ‚â• 1 golimumab administration. Among the placebo and golimumab patients, respectively, during the placebo-controlled periods, 40.6% and 50.3% had an AE, 2.4% and 3.8% had a serious AE, and 0.4% and 0.8% had a serious infection. Among all golimumab-treated patients, the numbers of events/100 patient-years (95% CI) were as follows: AEs, 175.2 (169.0, 181.6); serious AEs, 12.7 (11.0, 14.5); serious infections, 3.4 (2.5, 4.4); active tuberculosis, 0.4 (0.1, 0.8); opportunistic infection, 0.2 (0.1, 0.6); malignancies, 0.4 (0.2, 0.9), and MACE, 0.5 (0.2, 1.0). There were no cases of lymphoma. Three (0.6%) placebo-treated patients and 6 (0.5%) golimumab-treated patients died during the studies. Concomitant methotrexate was associated with increased occurrence of elevated alanine transaminase levels and lower incidence of antibodies to golimumab. During the placebo-controlled periods, serious infections in the placebo and golimumab groups were more common in patients receiving concomitant low-dose oral corticosteroids vs. those not receiving corticosteroids. Conclusions: IV golimumab demonstrated a safety profile that was broadly consistent across these rheumatologic indications and with other TNFi, including subcutaneous golimumab. Concomitant methotrexate or corticosteroids were associated with an increase in specific AEs. Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00973479. Registered on September 9, 2009.

The objective of this post hoc analysis was to examine regional differences in baseline disease activity and remission rates following golimumab treatment for RA. This was a planned, descriptive post hoc analysis of data from the GO-MORE trial. Baseline disease activity and remission were defined as moderate or severe based on EULAR criteria. This analysis included 3280 participants from the GO-MORE trial. All participants included in this analysis had high or moderate disease activity at baseline. At baseline, high disease activity was least common in Europe (71.0%), Canada (77.0%), and the Middle East (78.2%) and most common in Latin America (90.7%), South Africa (91.5%), and Asia (92.5%). Month 6 remission rates were highest in South Africa (29.1%), Europe (27.9%), and the Middle East (27.3%) and lowest in Canada (19.7%), Latin America (17.2%), and Asia (15.0%). Higher rates of remission in each geographical region generally corresponded with lower baseline disease activity. We suspect that access to care and implementation of the treat-to-target strategy were the most important determinants, but this apparent relationship needs to be confirmed in further studies that include a statistical analysis of prognostic indicators.

However, few adequately controlled studies are available concerning the concurrent effect of AZ on the immune and clinical responses to treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Thirty patients suffering from classical seropositive RA received AZ (1.5 - 2.0 mg/kg/day) and placebo in a controlled clinical cross-over study for two 12-week periods. Other treatments were kept constant throughout the entire 6 months. In terms of the clinical responses of joint count and grip strength patients receiving AZ improved markedly, in contrast to the placebo group. After 2 months, joint scanning revealed no progress of the disease in patients undergoing AZ treatment. Corresponding with the remarkably beneficial clinical effect of AZ, a significant drop in immunoglobulins was observed. However, since AZ failed to suppress in vivo specific antibody synthesis in RA, the question remains as to whether this drug actually does interfere with the autoimmunogenesis of the disease."

Patients were assigned randomly to 5 years of treatment with MTX alone (initial dose, 7.5 mg/week) or with MTX (initial dose, 5 mg/week) plus their previous DMARD continued at half dosage. After 3 years of therapy, the combined-treatment group showed significantly better sustained response of the Lansbury index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein than the MTX-only group. Ten patients withdrew because of adverse drug effects, with a somewhat higher frequency in the combined-treatment group (six of 19, 32%) than in the MTX-only group (four of 18, 22%; difference not significant). One patient in each group withdrew because of insufficient response to therapy.

All participants started methotrexate combined with (a) active conventional treatment (either prednisolone tapered to 5 mg/day, or sulfasalazine combined with hydroxychloroquine and intra-articular corticosteroids), (b) certolizumab pegol, (c) abatacept, or (d) tocilizumab., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was adjusted clinical disease activity index remission (CDAI<=2.8) at 24 weeks with active conventional treatment as the reference. Key secondary outcomes and analyses included CDAI remission at 12 weeks and over time, other remission criteria, a non-inferiority analysis, and harms., RESULTS: 812 patients underwent randomisation. The mean age was 54.3 years (standard deviation 14.7) and 68.8% were women. Baseline disease activity score of 28 joints was 5.0 (standard deviation 1.1). Adjusted 24 week CDAI remission rates were 42.7% (95% confidence interval 36.1% to 49.3%) for active conventional treatment, 46.5% (39.9% to 53.1%) for certolizumab pegol, 52.0% (45.5% to 58.6%) for abatacept, and 42.1% (35.3% to 48.8%) for tocilizumab. Corresponding absolute differences were 3.9% (95% confidence interval -5.5% to 13.2%) for certolizumab pegol, 9.4% (0.1% to 18.7%) for abatacept, and -0.6% (-10.1% to 8.9%) for tocilizumab. Key secondary outcomes showed no major differences among the four treatments. Differences in CDAI remission rates for active conventional treatment versus certolizumab pegol and tocilizumab, but not abatacept, remained within the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 15% (per protocol population). The total number of serious adverse events was 13 (percentage of patients who experienced at least one event 5.6%) for active conventional treatment, 20 (8.4%) for certolizumab pegol, 10 (4.9%) for abatacept, and 10 (4.9%) for tocilizumab. Eleven patients treated with abatacept stopped treatment early compared with 20-23 patients in the other arms., CONCLUSIONS: All four treatments achieved high remission rates. Higher CDAI remission rate was observed for abatacept versus active conventional treatment, but not for certolizumab pegol or tocilizumab versus active conventional treatment. Other remission rates were similar across treatments. Non-inferiority analysis indicated that active conventional treatment was non-inferior to certolizumab pegol and tocilizumab, but not to abatacept. The results highlight the efficacy and safety of active conventional treatment based on methotrexate combined with corticosteroids, with nominally better results for abatacept, in treatment naive early rheumatoid arthritis., TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT2011-004720-35, NCT01491815.

9257701,,10.1101/2025.01.26.25321158,"Background/Purpose: rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. The mechanisms of CV disease in RA remain poorly understood. Observational data suggest that earlier treatment of RA produces better responses. This RCT (ACTRN12611000972921) evaluated whether adalimumab (ADA) improves CV risk biomarkers in patients ACPA-positive RA and to explore the contribution of known risk factors. Methods: 60 (30 early, 30 established) patients with moderate-highly active ACPA-positive RA were enrolled in a RCT of humira versus placebo (1: 1). Patients underwent assessments of Reactive Hyperaemic Index (RHI), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and disease activity twice before receiving treatment and then at weeks 1,4,12 and 24. Intention-to-treat analysis compared changes in each treatment arm by t test. Secondary analysis by random effects GLS regression modelling evaluated effects upon RHI and PWV adjusting for clustering within individuals. Results: there were no significant differences between in treatment arms for RHI. While preliminary analysis suggested that positive shared epitope (SE) status was associated with poorer endothelial function (p 0.02) rather than for inflammation (CRP p0.379) or treatment (p 0.487) this was not significant after adjustment for clustering. A large 0.65m/sec reduction in PWV was seen prior to treatment in both groups. At weeks 4 and 12 PWV was significantly lower in the ADA arm. This trend was seen more consistently in patients with recent onset (<12 months) disease. Secondary analysis found that the most significant effects upon PWV were age (p 0.000), mean arterial pressure (p0.000) and CRP (p0.004). Conclusion: treatment with ADA may improve aortic stiffness and treatment may be more effective in early disease. However the greater effects are from blood pressure and ageing. While PWV is clearly influenced by CRP RHI may be influenced more by SE status. Further work is needed evaluating ACPA-negative and SE-negative subjective and pre-clinical RA. (Table Presented)"
9261257,,10.1101/2025.01.26.25321158,"Background/Purpose: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with elevated cardiovascular (CV) risk not explained by traditional risk factors. Increased CV risk may develop prior to the onset of arthritis. Amongst RA patients Shared Epitope (SE) positivity is associated with increased CV mortality but it is unclear if this is mediated by inflammation. Observational studies suggest that TNFinhibition improves endothelial dysfunction and lowers CV risk but RCT data are lacking. HEART-RA is a single-site RCT evaluating the effect of Humira upon endothelial function in ACPA positive RA. Methods: ACPA positive RA patients with moderate disease activity were enrolled in a 24-week trial of Humira versus placebo on a background of usual care undergoing assessments of disease activity and endothelial function (reactive hyperaemic index - RHI) at baseline, 2, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. Serum lipids were evaluated when deemed appropriate by the treating clinician. Improvements RHI in Humira and placebo arms were compared by t test. Secondary analysis evaluated influences upon RHI by univariate analysis and multivariate time-series regression modelling. Results: 23 subjects included 9 early (<6months) and 14 established RA underwent a total 138 assessments. 1 patient carried none, 10 one and 12 two SE. 12 patients (4 Humira and 3 placebo) withdrew after week 12 and were assessed open label at 24 weeks. HDL was available for 28 and LDL for 24. There were non-significant trends to greater RHI improvements in the Humira arm. Secondary analysis found better RHI in patients currently receiving Humira distinct from more general negative effects of higher disease activity and SE dose. Paradoxically ever-smokers had better RHI. Limited data suggested positive effects from HDL and negative from LDL. Conclusion: Several disease-specific factors appear to contribute to endothelial dysfunction in RA. RHI is clearly better in patients receiving Humira distinct from the broader effects of disease activity. The paradoxical effect of smoking is not consistent with previous studies and is likely due to the small number of patients. However, negative effects of the SE are consistent with previous work. Furthermore, the effect appears to be quite distinct from inflammatory mechanisms seen in RA and introducing the possible role of antigen processing and lipid transport with implications for subjects with Pre-RA and therapies that that adversely influence lipids.

Primary outcome measure was the change of left ventricular longitudinal strain after 3 months of treatment. Additionally, we measured coronary flow reserve, flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls as oxidative stress markers and C-reactive protein blood levels at baseline and post-treatment., RESULTS: At baseline, patients among the three treatment arms had similar age, sex, disease activity score and atherosclerotic risk factors.

Methods: The study included 40 patients with RA who had an inadequate response to conventional therapy (identifier: IRCT2014011213739N2). The patients were permitted to continue the conventional therapy excluding NSAIDs. 21 of them were treated orally by M2000 at a dose of 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks and the others did not. Serum samples were collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after treatment and were tested for the serum level of anti-CCP and anti-dsDNA antibodies using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The serum level of RF and C-reactive proteins (CRP) was determined by the immunoturbidimetric assay, respectively. Results: At baseline, all patients in the M2000 treated group and the control group were positive for anti-CCP, RF. moreover, 4 of 21 (19%) in the M2000 treated group and 2 of the 19 (10.5%) patients in the control group were positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies, respectively.

Fifty-four adult RA patients were randomly allocated to methotrexate (MTX) (n = 27) and MTX plus sulphasalazine (SSZ) (n = 27) groups. The subjects were followed-up fortnightly for four weeks then monthly for six months. The disease activity was assessed with the help of 10 clinical and four laboratory indices. The improvement was graded as: minor, mild decreases in indices, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) continued, physician's global assessment (PGA) decreased by one; marked, acceptable decreases in indices, NSAIDs being taken sparingly, PGA decreased by at least 2, and complete, all indices normalised and patients discontinued NSAIDs completely. The improvement was considered clinically important when marked or complete improvement occurred. Adverse drug reactions resulted in withdrawal of 4 subjects from the MTX + SSZ group and 1 from the control groups. Four and three subjects in the combined and MTX groups respectively were lost to follow-up. Subjects in both groups showed significant decline in all indices except hemoglobin and neutrophil count.

Identifying and treating these problems could lead to improved patient quality of life and outcomes. Despite these risks being well-established, patients currently are not systematically targeted for management interventions for these morbidities. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a nurse-led integrated care review in primary care to identify and manage these morbidities., METHODS: A pilot cluster RCT was delivered across four UK general practices. Patients with a diagnostic Read code for one of the inflammatory rheumatological conditions of interest were recruited by post. In intervention practices (n = 2), eligible patients were invited to attend the INCLUDE review. Outcome measures included health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), patient activation, self-efficacy and treatment burden. A sample (n = 24) of INCLUDE review consultations were audio-recorded and assessed against a fidelity checklist., RESULTS: 453/789 (57%) patients responded to the invitation, although 114/453 (25%) were excluded as they either did not fulfil eligibility criteria or failed to provide full written consent. In the intervention practices, uptake of the INCLUDE review was high at 72%. Retention at 3 and 6 months both reached pre-specified success criteria. Participants in intervention practices had more primary care contacts than controls (mean 29 vs 22) over the 12 months, with higher prescribing of all relevant medication classes in participants in intervention practices, particularly so for osteoporosis medication (baseline 29% vs 12 month 46%). The intervention was delivered with fidelity, although potential areas for improvement were identified., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study suggest it is feasible to deliver an RCT of the nurse-led integrated care (INCLUDE) review in primary care. A significant morbidity burden was identified. Early results suggest the INCLUDE review was associated with changes in practice. Lessons have been learnt around Read codes for patient identification and refining the nurse training., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12765345."

Primary results of this phase 2b study have already been reported and show that baricitinib reduces signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with no unexpected safety signals1. MRI was used in this study to examine dose dependency of baricitinib on joint changes in a subgroup of patients (pts) with erosive RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Methods: In this phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial, 301 pts with active, established RA (> 8 swollen and 8 tender joints) on stable MTX were randomized 2:1:1:1:1 to placebo or 1 of 4 once-daily LY doses (1, 2, 4 or 8 mg) for up to 24 weeks. 208 pts (placebo [n=68], 1 mg [n=34], 2 mg [n=40], 4 mg [n=33], 8 mg [n=33]) with definitive radiographic erosion had MRI of the dominant hand/wrist at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Pts assigned to placebo or 1 mg were reassigned to an exploratory 4 mg or 2 mg twice daily group at week 12 and excluded from the 24-week analysis. Fat-suppressed, T1-weighted 3D gradient-echo and STIR images were obtained with and without gadolinium contrast using 1.5T MRI and a hand frame to ensure reproducible positioning. MR images were read independently by 2 expert radiologists blinded to treatment and visit order. Images were scored using RAMRIS and a validated 9-point cartilage loss scale. Total inflammation (osteitis + 3x synovitis) and total joint damage (erosion > 2.5x cartilage loss) scores were calculated. ANCOVA adjusting for baseline score and dose group was used for analysis. Due to the exploratory nature of the substudy, 1-sided p-values less than 0.1 were considered indicative of possible MRI difference (trends) vs placebo. Results: There was a significant (> smallest detectable change) decrease in osteitis over 12 weeks in 15% of pts on placebo vs 29% and 29% on baricitinib 4 and 8 mg, respectively. Similarly, synovitis decreased in 18% of pts on placebo vs 33% and 29% of pts on 4 or 8 mg baricitinib. Bone erosion did not progress in 80% of placebo vs 96% and 88% of pts on 4 or 8 mg baricitinib. Significant decreases in adjusted mean synovitis, osteitis and total inflammation scores were observed in the 4 mg and 8 mg groups compared to placebo at week 12 that persisted to week 24 (table 1). A trend in improvement in total joint damage was also observed for the 4 mg group. These MRI improvements correlated with significant improvements in tender and swollen joints in the 4 mg and 8 mg groups and with numeric decreases in median CRP.

Methods: after a 24-week blinded period, eligible patients entered an initial 52-week open-label extension (OLE); patients receiving 8 mg once daily (QD) continued with that dose and all others received 4 mg QD. Doses could be escalated to 8 mg QD at 28 or 32 weeks at investigator discretion when >= 6 tender and >= 6 swollen joints were present. Patients completing the first OLE were eligible to enter a second 52-week OLE and receive 4 mg QD regardless of previous dose. Results: in the 4-mg (n = 108) and 8-mg (n = 93) groups, treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) occurred in 63% and 67%, serious AE in 16% and 13%, infections in 35% and 40%, and serious infections in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for AE for all baricitinib groups in the second OLE were similar to or lower than rates observed in the first OLE. No opportunistic infections, tuberculosis cases, or lymphomas were observed through 128 weeks; 1 death occurred during the first OLE. Among all patients in both OLE, the proportions who achieved disease improvement at Week 24 were similar or increased at weeks 76 and 128.

METHODS: 301 patients with active RA on stable methotrexate were randomized 2: 1: 1: 1: 1 to placebo or once-daily baricitinib (1-, 2-, 4-, or 8-mg) for up to 24 weeks. 154 patients with definitive radiographic erosion had MRI of the hand/wrist at baseline and weeks 12 and 24. Two expert radiologists, blinded to treatment and visit order, scored images for synovitis, osteitis, bone erosion, and cartilage loss. Combined inflammation (osteitis + 3x synovitis score) and total joint damage (erosion + 2.5x cartilage loss score) scores were calculated. Treatment groups were compared using analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline scores. RESULTS: mean changes from baseline to week 12 for synovitis were -0.10, -1.50, and -1.60 for patients treated with placebo, baricitinib 4-mg, and baricitinib 8-mg, respectively (P=0.003 vs placebo for baricitinib 4- and 8-mg); mean changes for osteitis were 0.00, -3.20, and -2.10 (P=0.001 vs placebo for baricitinib 4-mg and P=0.037 for 8-mg) and mean changes for bone erosion were 0.90, 0.10, and 0.40 (P=0.089 for 4-mg and P=0.275 for 8 mg), respectively in these treatment groups. CONCLUSION: using MRI findings in this subgroup of patients suggest suppression of synovitis, osteitis, and combined inflammation by baricitinib 4- and 8-mg, which corroborate previously demonstrated clinical efficacy of baricitinib and increase confidence that baricitinib 4-mg could positively effect reduction of the radiographic progression in Phase III studies"

9260856,,10.3899/jrheum.110014,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Efficacy and Safety of Etanercept on Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Methotrexate Therapy in Japan (JESMR) study is to compare the efficacy of continuation versus discontinuation of methotrexate (MTX) when starting etanercept (ETN) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: In total, 151 patients with active RA who had been taking MTX were randomized to either ETN 25 mg twice a week with 6-8 mg/week MTX (the E+M group), or ETN alone (the E group). The primary endpoint at Week 52 was the radiographic progression assessed by van der Heijde-modified Sharp score.
RESULTS: The mean progression in total score at Week 52 was not significantly different, statistically, between the E+M group and the E group (0.8 vs 3.6, respectively; p = 0.06). However, a significant difference was observed in radiographic progression between Weeks 24 and 52 (0.3 vs 2.5; p = 0.03), and the mean progression of the erosion score was negative in the E+M group, which was significantly better than the E group at Week 52 (-0.2 vs 1.8; p = 0.02). Clinically, the cumulative probability plot of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-N values at Week 52 clearly demonstrated a superior response in the E+M group than in the E group. ACR20, 50, and 70 response rates at Week 52 in the E+M group (86.3%, 76.7%, and 50.7%) were significantly greater than those in the E group (63.8%; p = 0.003, 43.5%; p < 0.0001 and 29.0%; p = 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSION: MTX should be continued when starting ETN in patients with active RA. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00688103)."

High cost and increased risk of tuberculosis reactvaton with biologics and an equivalent effficacy of combinaton DMARD therapy make the later an inevitable next choice in developing countries like India. However, there is no consensus on the best combinaton csDMARD therapy due to lack of head-to-head trials comparing diferent combinaton therapies. Here, we studied the outcomes of two commonly used combinaton csDMARD regimens in RA. Objectve: The objectve of this study was to compare the effficacy and safety of the two combinaton csDMARD therapy in RA patients failing MTX monotherapy. Method(s): This is a 12-week, open-label, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial. RA patients with disease <2 years failing MTX monotherapy were randomized to add either of the two treatment regimens-lefunomide + hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine. The primary endpoint was proporton of patients achieving European League Against Rheumatsm (EULAR) good response. The secondary endpoints were improvement in iHAQ, US7 score, and adverse events. Result(s): Out of the 805 patients screened, 256 eligible patients were included in the trial and started on MTX monotherapy. Among them, 118 patients (46%) responded and 136 nonresponders were randomized to lefunomide (LEF) or sulfasalazine (SSZ) group (two patients were excluded). At the end of 12 weeks, 58.8% and 54.4% patients achieved EULAR good response in each group, respectvely (P = 0.7, odds rato [OR]: 1.1, 95% confdence interval [CI]: [0.6-2.36]]. DAS 28 remission was achieved by 42.6% and 44% of patients and median iHAQ was 0.7 (interquartle range [IQR]: 0.4-1) and 0.5 (IQR: 0.07-1.3) (P = 0.9) in LEF and SSZ groups, respectvely. The change in US7 score and adverse events was statstcally similar in both the groups. More patients in SSZ group required parenteral MTX as compared to LEF group (21% vs. 7.5%) (P = 0.04, OR: 3.2, 95% CI: [1.1-9.6]). Conclusion(s): Both the combinaton therapies are equally effectve in MTX monotherapy-resistant RA with a comparable safety profile. However, combinaton of oral SSZ and MTX may have higher incidence of gastrointestnal intolerance requiring switch to parenteral MTX."

Methods: Twenty-nine subjects with an inadequate response to methotrexate at a stable dose (at least 7.5 mg/week and no more than 25 mg/week) for a minimum of 3 months at screening were randomly assigned to etanercept 25 mg twice weekly or leflunomide (10 mg/day or 20 mg/day) in a 2:1 allocation, respectively. Primary end-point was proportion of subjects with 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria at week 16. Secondary end-point was proportion of subjects achieving moderate or good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response at week 16. Safety measures included evaluation of adverse events at each visit and laboratory data, including hematology and chemistry profiles. Results: Twenty subjects were allocated to the etanercept group and nine subjects were allocated to the leflunomide group. All the etanercept subjects completed the 16 weeks of treatment with no adverse events. Adverse events occurred in seven out of the nine subjects in the leflunomide group; elevated AST/ALT levels (>1 * UNL) occurred in 6 subjects and mild neutropenia (ANC< 1500/lL) in 1 subject.

This post-hoc analysis assessed potential relationships between haemoglobin and disease activity in Japanese patients with RA, enrolled in the KAKEHASI study (NCT02293902). METHODS: In this study, adult patients with moderate-to-severe active RA, who had an inadequate response to methotrexate, were randomised to subcutaneous sarilumab 150 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or 200 mg q2w or placebo for 24 weeks. Post-hoc analyses were conducted on changes in haemoglobin and proportion of anaemic patients, using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures assuming an unstructured covariance. Relationships between haemoglobin and efficacy measures were explored. RESULTS: At baseline, nearly half of patients had anaemia, defined by World Health Organization criteria (haemoglobin <12 g/dL, female; or <13 g/dL, male). At Week 24, the least squares mean change in haemoglobin levels was greater in sarilumab groups than for placebo (150 mg: 1.23 g/dL, 200 mg: 1.19 g/dL, placebo: 0.17 g/dL; p=0.0002 for both doses vs. placebo). By Week 24, the proportion of patients with anaemia was 17.8%, 22.9%, and 30.1% for sarilumab 150 mg, 200 mg, and placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with RA, both doses of sarilumab were associated with greater improvement in haemoglobin levels and reduction in proportion of patients with anaemia, compared with placebo.

METHODS: Sera from adults with active RA despite MTX therapy, who received subcutaneous injections of placebo + MTX (MTX alone, n = 34) or golimumab 50 or 100 mg every 2 or 4 weeks + MTX (n = 137), were analyzed for levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), interleukin 18 (IL-18), E-selectin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1).
RESULTS: Golimumab + MTX treatment significantly decreased serum CRP, SAA, IL-18, E-selectin, TIMP-1, and MMP-9 levels (median percent changes of -4.1% to -74.3% across treatment groups) versus MTX alone (-5.8% to 9.7%) when first measured at Week 4; decreases were sustained through Week 16. Larger magnitudes of decrease in all biomarkers were observed for clinical responders versus nonresponders. For golimumab + MTX, regression analyses including all biomarkers and select clinical measures showed that reductions in levels of several markers (SAA, E-selectin, MMP-9) as early as Week 4 correlated significantly with improvement in swollen joint count (SJC) at Week 16, as did reductions in E-selectin with improvement in tender joint count at Week 16. After accounting for the biomarkers, however, treatment group was no longer significant for SJC.
CONCLUSION: Significant decreases in several inflammatory biomarkers were associated with golimumab + MTX therapy. Decreases in serum levels of SAA, E-selectin, and MMP-9 at Week 4 may be useful in predicting clinical response at Week 16."

Material and Methods: We observed 98 patients with a documented diagnosis of RA. All patients were randomized into two groups, depending on the basic therapy variant: Group 1 (n=56) - patients with the combined therapy of methotrexate and rituximab; Group 2 (n=42) - patients with methotrexate therapy only. Follow-up was 24 months. To assess life quality (LQ) questionnaires EQ-5D and HAQ were used. Results: While filling in the EQ-5D questionnaire at baseline, all RA patients noted health problems in varying degrees. After a year of therapy a statistically significant increase in the health index was established both in the group 1 and group 2 - 0.61+/-0.04 and 0.63+/-0.07 (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). A statistically significant increase was found with the VAS RA patients in group 1 in 12 months (46.7+/-6.3 mm, p<0.05) and in 24 months (49.3+/-11.4 mm, p<0.05) on the initial data. In assessing the HAQ index in 12 months a statistically significant reduction was revealed in the group of patients treated with rituximab, relative benchmarks - 1.125 +/-0.08 g/cm2 (p<0.05). In the group of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy, a statistically significant change in HAQ index was not obtained. Similar patterns persisted through 24 months. Conclusion: By EQ-5D questionnaire satisfactory therapeutic effect was observed in the group of the patients with a combined therapy of methotrexate and rituximab, while in the group with MTX only-it's minimal one. When evaluating the HAQ index a pronounced clinical benefit was noted in the group of the patients receiving rituximab while in the group with MTX only-it is a minimal one."
9256854,,10.3899/jrheum.080813,"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abatacept plus methotrexate (MTX) over 5 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: patients were randomized to abatacept 10 or 2 mg/kg or placebo, plus MTX. Patients completing the 1-year, double-blind period entered the longterm extension, where all patients received a fixed dose of abatacept ~10 mg/kg. We describe safety analyses for all patients who received at least 1 dose of abatacept and efficacy analyses for the original ~10 mg/kg abatacept-treated group, over 5 years.
RESULTS: of the 235 abatacept- or placebo-treated patients completing the double-blind period, 219 entered the longterm extension; 130 (59.4%) were continuing at Year 5. No unexpected safety events were observed during the longterm extension compared with the double-blind period. Incidence rates of adverse events (AE) and serious AE were 489.7 and 20.0/100 patient-years in Year 1 versus 374.9 and 18.9/100 patient-years in the cumulative period, respectively. Using exploratory analyses, improvements observed at Year 1 in the 10 mg/kg group were maintained at Year 5, as assessed by ACR responses (ACR20=77.1% vs 82.7%; ACR50=53.0% vs 65.4%; ACR70=28.9% vs 40.4% at Years 1 and 5, respectively) and disease activity (Low Disease Activity State=48.2% vs 58.5%; Disease Activity Score-28-defined remission=25.3% vs 45.3% at Years 1 and 5, respectively).
CONCLUSION: abatacept maintained the efficacy observed at Year 1 over 5 years of treatment, and demonstrated consistent safety and tolerability. These data, along with relatively high retention rates, support the longterm clinical benefit provided by selective T cell costimulation modulation.

METHODS: patients randomised to IV abatacept (10 or 2 mg/kg) or placebo, plus MTX, during the 1-year double-blind (DB) period of a Phase 2b study could enter the long-term extension (LTE) and receive IV abatacept 10 mg/kg monthly. Safety was assessed in patients who received ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢1 dose of abatacept; efficacy was assessed in patients originally randomised to 10 mg/kg abatacept (as-observed data).
RESULTS: a total of 219 patients entered the LTE; 114 (52.1%) completed 7 years of treatment with abatacept plus MTX. Cumulative (DB + LTE) incidence rates of serious adverse events, serious infections, malignancies, and autoimmune events were 17.6, 3.2, 1.8, and 1.2/100 patient-years, respectively. Safety was consistent between the DB (n=220) and cumulative (n=287) periods. Improvements in American College of Rheumatology responses, disease activity, and normalisation of physical function and health-related quality of life were maintained over time. Approximately 80% of patients who achieved low disease activity or normalised modified Health Assessment Questionnaire scores at Year 1, and who remained in the study, sustained these responses in each subsequent year.
CONCLUSIONS: IV abatacept in combination with MTX demonstrated consistent safety and sustained efficacy over 7 years in MTX inadequate responders with established RA. Furthermore, some patients demonstrated a normalisation of physical function and health-related quality of life that was sustained over time."

Methods: RA patients were eligible if they had active disease despite treatment with MTX plus TNF blockers. All patients have no steroids, and no previous history of CVD. 32 patients with moderate to severe active RA patients (DAS28 >3.2) were randomly assigned to receive TCZ plus MTX (n=16) or ABT plus MTX (n=16). All patients with worsening disease activity at week 12, the patients were allowed to escape to another group (by clinician's judgment).Arterial stiffness was assessed with cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and augmentation index corrected for a heart rate of 75 beats per minute (AIx@75) at baseline and 24 weeks follow-up. Cardiovascular risk factors and clinical data was collected at regular visits.CAVI was calculated by the following formula:CAVI= 2r/dPxln(Ps/Pd)PWV2, where Ps is systolic blood pressure, Pd is diastolic blood pressure, PWV is pulse wave velocity, dP is Ps- Pd,r is blood density.CAVI measures arterial wall stiffness independent of blood pressure and it is superior to PWV as an index of arterial stiffness. Results: The characteristics of each group at baseline were not significantly different. 15 each in the TCZ and ABT groups completed 24 weeks.CAVI and AIx@75 were attenuated significantly by TCZ (CAVI; week 0-week 24, 0.92+0.15 m/s, p= 0.02) (AIx@75; week 0-week 24, 3.59+0.33%, p= 0.03).On the other hand, CAVI and A,hx@75 were not attenuated significantly by ABT (CAVI; week 0-week 24, 0.22+0.11 m/s, p= 0.52) (AIx@75; week 0-week 24, 0.98+0.21%, p= 0.66). The change (week 0-week 24) CAVI and AIx@75 of the TCZ group were significantly improvement than those of the ABT group (TCZ vs. ABT, CAVI: p= 0.024; AIx@75: p=0.032). TCZ and ABT did not significantly change carotid intima-media thickness (week 0-week 24, TCZ: 0.00+0.11 mm, ABT: -0.00+0.13 mm), and did not produce significant changes in carotid artery plaque (week 0-week 24, numbers of combined grade 0/1/2/3/4, TCZ: -1/1/0/0, ABT: -1/0/-0/0). There were no significant changes either within ratio of serum total cholesterol (TC) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (week 0-week 24, TCZ: 0.02+0.04; ABT: 0.03+0.03) (p>0.05). In the TCZ, TC was significantly increased (week 0-week 24, -18.0+5.2 mg/dL, p= 0.03). There were no significant changes within the ABT group in TC (ABT: -2.0+0.6 mg/dL; p=0.75).

However, less is known about clinical responses as predictors of PRO changes. The goal of this study was to examinewhether clinical outcomes atWeek 12 were predictive of PRO changes atWeek 24 in Latin American patients with RA. Methods: in the first phase of an open-label study (NCT00848354), patients from Latin America with methotrexate (MTX)-resistant, moderate to severe active RA were randomized 2: 1 to receive etanercept 50 mg weekly plus MTX (ETN+MTX; n=281) or an additional conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine) plus MTX (DMARD+MTX; n=142) for 24weeks. The PROs includedHealthAssessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 36-item Short Form (SF-36), Hospital Anxiety (HADS-A) and Depression (HADS-D) subscales, Physician and Patient Global Assessment scores (PGA, PtGA), Physician and Patient Satisfaction, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: RA (WPAI: rA), and Resource Utilization. PRO changes from baseline to Week 24 were calculated by baseline to Week 12 responses on ACR (<20, >=20 to <50, >=50 to <70, >=70) and on the 28-joint Disease Activity Scores (DAS28 >=3.2 >=2.6 to <3.2 and <2.6). Observed-cases data for each treatment group were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model with linear contrast, adjusted for baseline PRO and ACR/DAS28 values. Results: for both ETN+MTX-andDMARD+MTX-treated patients, therewas a significant linear trend between Week 12 changes in ACR and DAS28 responses andWeek 24 changes in HAQ-DI (p<0.001 for all), with numerical improvements generally favoring the ETN+MTX group (Figure). Similar relationships were observed for SF-36 PGA, PtGA, Physician Satisfaction, Patient Satisfaction, and WPAI Activity Impairment. In addition, there was a significant linear trend between Week 12 changes in ACR, but not DAS28 responses, and Week 24 changes in the number of visits to rheumatologists, other physicians, or emergency rooms due to RA for ETN+MTX-treated, but not DMARD+MTX-treated patients. Other relationships could not be assessed with confidence due to a small number of patients in the DMARD+MTX responder subgroup.

METHODS: Patients with RA were eligible if they had active disease (28-joint Disease Activity Score > 3.2) and no prior treatment with methotrexate or biologics. All 64 patients had no history of cardiovascular disease or steroid treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive TCZ alone (n = 22), ETN alone (n = 21), or ADA alone (n = 21). Arterial stiffness was assessed with cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and aortic augmentation index normalized to a fixed heart rate of 75 bpm (AIx@75) at baseline and 24 weeks' followup. Clinical data were collected at regular visits.
RESULTS: The characteristics of each group at baseline were not significantly different. In all groups there was significant attenuation from baseline to 24 weeks in CAVI (Week 0-Week 24, TCZ: 0.85 ¬¨¬± 0.15 m/s, p = 0.02; ETN: 0.81 ¬¨¬± 0.18 m/s, p = 0.03; ADA: 0.90 ¬¨¬± 0.21 m/s, p = 0.02) and in AIx@75.

Methods: in the first phase of an open-label study (NCT00848354), patients from Latin America with methotrexate (MTX)-resistant, moderate to severe active RA were randomized 2: 1 to receive etanercept 50 mg weekly plus MTX (ETN+MTX; n=281) or an additional conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine) plus MTX (DMARD+MTX; n=142) for 24weeks. The PROs includedHealthAssessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 36-item Short Form (SF-36), Hospital Anxiety (HADS-A) and Depression (HADS-D) subscales, Physician and Patient Global Assessment scores (PGA, PtGA), Physician and Patient Satisfaction, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: RA (WPAI: rA), and Resource Utilization. PRO changes from baseline to Week 24 were calculated by baseline to Week 12 responses on ACR (<20, >=20 to <50, >=50 to <70, >=70) and on the 28-joint Disease Activity Scores (DAS28 >=3.2 >=2.6 to <3.2 and <2.6).

Objective: To examine long-term safety/efficacy of etanercept, methotrexate, and/or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in Latin American patients with moderate-to-severe active RA. Methods: In the first phase of this open-label study, patients were randomized to etanercept 50 mg weekly plus methotrexate or conventional DMARD (hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine) plus methotrexate for 24 weeks. At the start of the second phase (week 24), investigators selected a treatment regimen that included any combination/dosage of etanercept, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine based on previous treatment response, preference, and local product labeling, and was continued for the 104-week extension. Results: In the extension, in the group previously randomized to etanercept-plus-methotrexate therapy, etanercept was continued in 259/260 patients; methotrexate continued in 260/260; and hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine added in 8/260 and 3/260, respectively. In the group previously randomized to conventional DMARD-plus-methotrexate therapy, conventional DMARD was discontinued in 86/126 and etanercept added in 105/126. Among etanercept-exposed patients (total exposure, 798.1 patient-year [PY]), rates of adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections per PY were 1.7, 0.07, and 0.02 events per PY. In both groups, after treatment modification was permitted, clinical response rates and improvements in clinical/patient-reported outcomes from baseline were sustained to week 128. Conclusion: After investigators were permitted to modify treatment, etanercept was part of the treatment regimen in 95% of patients.

This causes disruption of the well organized supramolecular architectures of the basal lamina composed of a network of collagen IV and other components such AS laminins, nidogens or perlecan. The aim of this study was to 1) investigate the circulating levels of mmp-degraded collagen type IV fragments in RA and 2) if TCZ may reduce the epithelial turnover of the RA pathogenesis. Methods: the LITHE biomarker study (n =682) was a phase III double-blind, placebo (pbo)-controlled, parallel group study of 4- and 8-mg/kg TCZ in combination with methotrexate (MTX). The biomarker C4M, a competitive ELISA assay evaluating fragments of type IV collagen, was tested in serum from baseline and week 4, 16, 24, and 52. A dose-dependent effect was investigated and the differences between groups were evaluated by mann-whitney test. Early response was evaluated at week 16 AS 7-20% improvement in swollen/tender joint counts; and ACR50 was evaluated at week 52. Results: all of the 3 patient groups experienced a decrease of C4M from baseline to week 16 of roughly 20%. At this point there were no significant differences between the C4M levels of the placebo group compared to treatment groups. This level seemed to BE stabile from week 16-24 for all of the 3 groups. Interestingly, from week 24-52 C4M in the placebo group significantly increased (p<0.0001) from a geometric mean of 70.7ng/ml to 83.6ng/ml. The C4M level of the patient group receiving TCZ 4mg/kg was steady with a geometric mean of 68.6 at week 24 and 71.4 at week 52. Patients in the TCZ 8mg/kg had a significant decrease (p=0.0017) from a geometric mean of 67.8 to 58.8 from week 24-52.there was a significant difference in C4M level between placebo and treatment groups at week 52 (p<0.05). Conclusion: the differences of C4M between the 3 treatment groups at week 52, indicate a dose-dependent reduction of epithelial degradation AS an effect of treatment over time. Furthermore, the decrease of C4M from baseline to week 16 in all of the 3 treatment groups, suggests that MTX has an additional effect on top of that of TCZ. (figure presented)"
9260790,,10.3899/jrheum.120447,"OBJECTIVE: to assess radiographic progression, physical function, clinical disease activity, and safety in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) and who were treated with tocilizumab-MTX or MTX during Year 2 of a 2-year study.
METHODS: during Year 1, patients were randomized to placebo-MTX, 4 mg/kg tocilizumab-MTX, or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab-MTX. During Year 2, patients continued the initial double-blind treatment or switched to open-label 8 mg/kg tocilizumab-MTX. Co-primary endpoints at Week 104 were mean change from baseline in Genant-modified Total Sharp Score (GmTSS) and adjusted mean area under the curve (AUC) for change from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Signs and symptoms of RA and safety were also evaluated.
RESULTS: at Week 104, mean change from baseline in GmTSS was significantly lower for patients initially randomized to tocilizumab-MTX 4 mg/kg (0.58; p = 0.0025) or 8 mg/kg (0.37; p < 0.0001) than for patients initially randomized to placebo-MTX (1.96). Adjusted mean AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI was also significantly lower in patients initially randomized to tocilizumab-MTX 4 mg/kg (-287.5; p < 0.0001) or 8 mg/kg (-320.8; p < 0.0001) than in patients initially randomized to placebo-MTX (-139.4). Signs and symptoms of RA were maintained or showed improvement. No new safety signals were noted.
CONCLUSION: compared with placebo-MTX, tocilizumab-MTX significantly inhibited structural joint damage and improved physical function in patients with RA who previously had inadequate response to MTX. An extension of this study is continuing and will provide additional longterm efficacy and safety data. National Clinical Trials registry NCT00106535."

The serum Protein Fingerprint, type I collagen degradation mediated by MMP-cleavage (C1M), is a biomarker of connective tissue destruction. We investigated 1) whether baseline (BL) C1M levels were correlated with structural status, progression and pain, 2) how C1M changed with time and treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ) and 3) if C1M could be a potential early surrogate marker of treatment efficacy with TCZ. Methods: LITHE biomarker study (n=585) was a 1-year phase III, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled, parallel group study of TCZ 4 or 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, in RA patients on stable doses of methotrexate (MTX). C1M was tested in serum from BL and week 2, 4, 16, 24 and 52. Spearman's correlations was analysed between BL level of C1M (log transformed) and clinical measures. The associations between BL serum C1M and change in JSN and mTSS were investigated in the PBO group by regressions analysis, including CRP, age, BMI, disease duration and BL JSN/mTSS. Change in C1M levels were studied as a function of time and treatment. Lastly, in patients receiving TCZ the level of change within 1-year in structural progression and pain were investigated in two groups based of the change in C1M level until week 16: 1; <35% change in C1M and 2; >35% change in C1M and analysed by Student's T-test. Results: BL C1M was significantly correlated with change in JSN at week 24 (r=0.38 p<0.0001) and at week 52 (r=0.63, p<0.0001) and with changes in mTSS at 24 (r=0.21 p<0.012) and 52 weeks (r=0.58, p<0.0001). BL C1M was weakly negatively correlated with change in VAS pain at 24 weeks (r=-0.1, p<0.05). However, BL C1M was not correlated to BL JSN (rho=0.12) or mTSS (rho=0.14), but highly correlated with BL VAS pain (rho=0.3). Serum C1M was dose-dependently reduced by TCZ8 (p<0.0001) and TCZ4+MTX (p<0.05) as compared to PBO. Change in C1M at 16 weeks after treatment initiation in the TCZ groups was related to the level of radiographic changes over 1 year (p<0.05). Surprisingly, VAS pain had a negative relationship with change in C1M at 16 weeks. (Figure presented) Conclusion: MMP-mediated tissue degradation is imperative in joint destruction, as those patients with the highest levels of C1M were significantly more likely to progress in JSN and mTSS compared to those with a low level. Surprisingly, pain showed the reverse relationship with C1M. C1M may assist in identifying those patients that are rapid progressors. Interestingly, TCZ dose-dependently inhibited C1M level already after 2 weeks, suggesting almost immediate onset of joint protection. C1M may both be a surrogate marker of structural efficacy and enable prognostic identification of those patients that are in most need of treatment."

However, a significant amount of patients do not respond adequately long term and would most likely benefit from changing treatment at an early time point. Biomarkers reflecting joint tissue degradation (e.g. C1M) are direct measures of joint health and have been shown to be prognostic of structural progression, as well as pharmacodynamics markers of tocilizumab response. We investigated whether lack of early changes in biomarkers, in response to tocilizumab, were predictive of lack of long-term(52 week) clinical benefit. Method(s): Pooled biomarker data from the two treatment arms (4 and 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + MTX) were included in this reanalysis of the LITHE (a phase III randomized placebo controlled study, NCT00106535) biomarker study (N=380). Patients had moderate-severe RA and were DMARD-IRs. Biomarkers reflecting tissue degradation were selected; type I, II, III, IV and VI collagen metabolites C1M, C2M, C3M, C4M and C6M. Missing biomarker data(<5%) were imputed using KNN. Patients were dichotomized into quartiles using 16-week %-suppression in the biomarkers. Long-term clinical benefit was assessed by ACR20 and ACR50 at week 52. Escape patients were annotated as ACR non-responders. Mann- Whitney was used to compare level of biomarker suppression between responders and non-responders. Logistic regression was used to predict lack of response, adjusting for age, sex, BMI and baseline biomarker level. Result(s): There were a total of 196 (50.5%) ACR20 and 266 (70.0%) ACR50 non-responders at week 52. There were significant differences in the median levels of biomarker suppression between ACR non-responders and responders: i) C1M; ACR20, 28 vs. 47% (p=0.0004), ACR50, 34 vs. 45% (p=0.02), ii) C2M; ACR20, 7 vs. 13%(p=0.007), ACR50, 8 vs. 13% (p=0.02), iii) C3M; ACR20, 14 vs. 28% (p=0.0008),ACR50, 17 vs. 30% (p=0.009), iv) C4M; ACR20, 20 vs. 30% (p=0.0001), ACR50, 22 vs. 29% (p=0.04), and v) C6M; ACR20, 36 vs. 53% (p=0.0004), ACR50, 37 vs. 56%(p=0.004). C1M was the best marker for prediction of whom would not respond totocilizumab. Patients with a 38 to 60% suppression in C1M were 2.0 times more likely to achieve an ACR50, whereas patient with less than a 38% suppression were 3.2 to 3.7 more likely not to achieve an ACR50 response and 3.7 to 5.6 more likely not to achieve an ACR20 response (table). The remaining markers could predict lack of ACR50 with ORs from 1.9 to 2.9 and ACR20 with ORs from 2.4 to 3.0, if the marker actually increased from baseline to 16 weeks (Q4, table). Conclusion(s): We found that lack of early inhibition in tissue turnover biomarkers, especially C1M, were predictive of long term lack of clinical benefit. This indicates that biomarkers associated with joint tissue health may be used as patient monitoring and risk-assessment tool for anti-IL6 effect."

9258274,,10.1371/journal.pone.0113937,"UNLABELLED: approximately 30% of rheumatoid arthritis patients achieve inadequate response to anti-TNF biologics. Attempts to identify molecular biomarkers predicting response have met with mixed success. This may be attributable, in part, to the variable and subjective disease assessment endpoints with large placebo effects typically used to classify patient response. Sixty-one patients with active RA despite methotrexate treatment, and with MRI-documented synovitis, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo. Blood was collected at baseline and genome-wide transcription in whole blood was measured using microarrays. The primary endpoint in this study was determined by measuring the transfer rate constant (Ktrans) of a gadolinium-based contrast agent from plasma to synovium using MRI. Secondary endpoints included repeated clinical assessments with DAS28(CRP), and assessments of osteitis and synovitis by the RAMRIS method. Infliximab showed greater decrease from baseline in DCE-MRI Ktrans of wrist and MCP at all visits compared with placebo (P<0.001). Statistical analysis was performed to identify genes associated with treatment-specific 14-week change in Ktrans. The 256 genes identified were used to derive a gene signature score by averaging their log expression within each patient. The resulting score correlated with improvement of Ktrans in infliximab-treated patients and with deterioration of Ktrans in placebo-treated subjects. Poor responders showed high expression of activated B-cell genes whereas good responders exhibited a gene expression pattern consistent with mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes and high levels of reticulated platelets. This gene signature was significantly associated with clinical response in two previously published whole blood gene expression studies using anti-TNF therapies. These data provide support for the hypothesis that anti-TNF inadequate responders comprise a distinct molecular subtype of RA characterized by differences in pre-treatment blood mRNA expression. They also highlight the importance of placebo controls and robust, objective endpoints in biomarker discovery.

Despite substantial improvement in treatments in recent years, treatment response is still not guaranteed. The aim of this study was to identify variation in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) of RA patients in response to Tocilizumab, and to investigate both molecular and clinical factors influencing response. Clinical and biochemical data for 485 RA patients receiving Tocilizumab in combination with methotrexate were extracted from the LITHE phase III clinical study (NCT00106535), and post-hoc analysis conducted. Latent class mixed models were used to identify statistically distinct trajectories of DAS28 after the initiation of treatment. Biomarker measurements were then analysed cross-sectionally and temporally, to characterise patients by serological biomarkers and clinical factors. We identified three distinct trajectories of drug response: class 1 (n = 85, 17.5%), class 2 (n = 338, 69.7%) and class 3 (n = 62, 12.8%). All groups started with high DAS28 on average (DAS28 > 5.1). Class 1 showed the least reduction in DAS28, with significantly more patients seeking escape therapy (p < 0.001). Class 3 showed significantly higher rates of improvement in DAS28, with 58.1% achieving ACR response levels compared to 2.4% in class 1 (p < 0.0001). Biomarkers of inflammation, MMP-3, CRP, C1M, showed greater reduction in class 3 compared to the other classes.

Here we describe the methods and rationale for these studies. Methods and Rationale: The MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies included men (aged 21‚Äì65¬†years) with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatic diseases, respectively. Participants had no history of reproductive health issues, and the following semen parameter values (‚â• 5th percentile of World Health Organization reference values) at baseline: semen volume ‚â• 1.5¬†mL, total sperm/ejaculate ‚â• 39 million, sperm concentration ‚â• 15¬†million/mL, sperm total motility ‚â• 40% and normal sperm morphology ‚â• 30%. Each trial included a 13-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period (filgotinib 200¬†mg vs placebo, up to N = 125 per arm), for pooled analysis of the week-13 primary endpoint (proportion of participants with ‚â• 50% decrease from baseline in sperm concentration). All semen assessments were based on two samples (‚â§ 14¬†days apart) to minimize effects of physiological variation; stringent standardization processes were applied across assessment sites. From week¬†13, MANTA and MANTA-RAy study designs deviated owing to disease-specific considerations. All subjects with a ‚â• 50% decrease in sperm parameters continued the study in the monitoring phase until reversibility, or up to a maximum of 52¬†weeks, with standard of care as treatment. Overall conclusions from MANTA and MANTA-RAy will be based on the totality of the data, including secondary/exploratory measures (e.g. sperm motility/morphology, sex hormones, reversibility of any effects on semen parameters). Conclusions: Despite the complexities, the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies form a robust trial programme that is the first large-scale, placebo-controlled evaluation of potential impacts of an advanced IBD and rheumatic disease therapy on semen parameters.

However, the effects of common anti-inflammatory treatments on HDL function are not yet known. In this study we investigated the impact of infliximab + methotrexate (MTX) versus placebo + MTX on HDL functionality in patients with early RA. Methods: Eighteen patients 55.58 (12. 45) years with erosive early RA receiving MTX were randomised to infliximab (5mg/kg) or placebo infusions. At week 54 and thereafter, all patients received infliximab. HDL function was measured at baseline, 54 weeks and 110 weeks. The impact of HDL on cultured endothelial cells was assayed using ESR Spectroscopy for nitric oxide bioavailability (NO) and Superoxide Production (SO). HDL-associated Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity was measured by spectrophotometry. HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux was measured in J774 macrophages, pre-treated with cAMP. Results: Combination of infliximab and MTX treatment at 54 weeks resulted in marginally improved HDL endothelial properties compared to MTX alone. At 110 weeks, following two years treatment with Infliximab and MTX all endothelial HDL properties including NO, SO and PON-1 were significantly improved (p>0.01) (Fig. 1). HDL's cholesterol efflux capacity remained unchanged at 54 and 110 weeks of treatment. (Figure presented) Conclusion: In this study we demonstrated, for the first time in patients with RA that two years treatment with infliximab has a significant beneficial effect on HDL endothelial properties of these patients. These findings suggest that targeting anti-TNF alpha pathway might be a novel treatment option to improve HDL functionality in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions."

However, the ability to identify patients most likely to have progressive disease is limited in those with established RA. In MOBILITY (NCT01061736), sarilumab + MTX significantly reduced radiographic joint damage compared with placebo (Pbo) + MTX at 24 and 52 weeks. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included infections, neutropenia, injection site reactions and increased transaminases. This study evaluated the prognostic utility of proteins involved in bone resorption and joint inflammation in patients treated with Pbo+MTX from the MOBILITY study. Methods: serum markers were measured at baseline and post-treatment in patients receiving Pbo+MTX (n = 128) or subcutaneous SAR 200 mg q2w + MTX (n = 131). For baseline analysis, both treatment groups were included; for post-treatment analysis, only Pbo+MTX patients were analysed. Spearman ranked correlations (rho) were calculated between baseline markers and baseline radiographic scores (x-ray) or DAS28-CRP for both treatment groups. Correlations between baseline biomarkers and change from baseline in x-ray scores at week 52 or DAS28-CRP at week 24 were calculated for the Pbo+MTX group. Results: correlations were observed between baseline MMP-3 levels and baseline x-ray scores as well as week 52 change from baseline in mTSS and ES. Baseline C1M was associated with week 52 JSN progression. Baseline C1M and C3M correlated with baseline DAS28-CRP (rho = 0.36 and 0.199 respectively; nominal P < 0.01). No significant correlations were identified between baseline levels of RANKL, osteoprotegerin, OC or CTX-1 with baseline clinical scores. Conclusion: analysis of markers described in the literature as prognostic of structural damage and disease activity in MTX-IR patients showed correlation in MOBILITY patients. These data suggest that multivariate analysis of markers may be necessary to identify increased risk of joint destruction and elevated disease activity in patients with established RA.

Pre-clinical studies have implicated IL-6 signaling in regulation of osteoclasts and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) to increase levels of bone resorptive molecules like receptor activated NF kB ligand (RANKL) and joint destructive proteins, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Blockade of IL-6R signaling by sarilumab significantly reduced structural damage in RA patients, as measured by the modified van der Heijde total Sharp Score, including the erosion score and joint space narrowing components in the Phase 3 part of the MOBILITY study (NCT01061736). Most common TEAEs included infections and injection site reactions. A higher incidence of serious infections was observed with sarilumab. Lab abnormalities included decreases in neutrophils and increases in transaminases and lipids. To elucidate mechanisms of clinical reduction of bone and joint damage by sarilumab, we evaluated a panel of serum markers associated with bone resorption (RANKL and osteoprotegerin [OPG]), bone turnover (CTX-1 and C1M), osteoblast formation (osteocalcin [OC]), synovium (MMP-3 and C3M) and cartilage degradation (C2M) in patients enrolled in MOBILITY B. Methods: Sera were analyzed from 128 patients treated with placebo (Pbo) + methotrexate (MTX), and 131 patients receiving subcutaneous 200 mg sarilumab every other week (q2w) + MTX. Serum biomarkers levels were measured by ELISA. All biomarkers were analyzed at baseline, and post-treatment at Wks 2 and 24, with the exceptions of CTX-1 and OC, which were analyzed at baseline, Wks 24 and 52 post-treatment. A mixed effect model with repeated measures on % change from baseline (after rank transformation) was performed for all biomarkers (ANOVA-type method). Treatments were compared at each visit. For samples above the limit of quantitation (LOQ), the LOQ was used in analyses, for samples below the LOQ, half the LOQ was used. Results: Sarilumab + MTX treatment significantly reduced levels of MMP-3 and MMP generated fragments of collagen type 1 and type 3 (C1M and C3M) compared to Pbo + MTX at all timepoints analyzed (Table). RANKL levels were also reduced at Wk 24 in the sarilumab + MTX group, however approximately 15% of values were above the LOQ. In contrast, OC increased from baseline in the sarilumab 200 mg q2w + MTX group compared to Pbo + MTX but did not reach significance (Wk 52, p=0.0571). Conclusion: Sarilumab reduced bone resorption and joint damage markers, and increased OC, a marker of bone formation, in RA patients. This is the first report that IL-6 inhibition leads to RANKL reduction in RA patients. This data supports a mechanism whereby increased IL-6 signaling promotes structural damage through osteoclasts and FLS and by reducing osteoblast bone formation. (Table Presented)."

Patients and methods: short-term analysis was based on 24-week wholesale acquisition costs of drugs and treatment response observed in the MONARCH Phase III trial (NCT02332590) per American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50 criteria and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Moderate/Good Disease Activity Score 28-joint count erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Long-term analysis, which also considered drug administration and routine care costs, was conducted via a 6-month decision tree and a 1- to 10-year Markov model with microsimulation of patient profiles from the MOBILITY Phase III trial (NCT01061736). Utilities and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated by mapping 6-month ACR levels to a relative change in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index score and via published algorithms. Results: for sarilumab and adalimumab, respectively, 24-week drug costs were $18,954 and $29,232, and costs per responder were $26,435 vs $50,055 on ACR20; $41,475 vs $98,425 on ACR50; and $22,511 vs $41,230 on EULAR Moderate/Good. Base case results at 10 years for total costs and QALYs were $176,977 and 2.75 for sarilumab and $212,136 and 2.61 for adalimumab, respectively. Sarilumab was consistently the more effective and cost-saving treatment across all short-term and long-term incremental analyses. Conclusion: sarilumab monotherapy was the economically dominant treatment on incremental cost per responder and incremental cost per QALY compared with adalimumab monotherapy. These results were maintained within the sensitivity analyses"

Patients with RA have elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels; however, the utility of IL-6 as a predictor of treatment response is unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate, by post hoc analysis, whether baseline IL-6 levels could predict sarilumab treatment responses in two phase III studies. METHODS: Serum IL-6 concentrations were measured in patients with RA prior to receiving sarilumab 200 mg (n = 148) or adalimumab 40 mg (n = 152) every two weeks (Q2W) (MONARCH, NCT02332590) or sarilumab 150 or 200 mg+methotrexate (n = 401 and n = 396, respectively) or placebo+methotrexate (n = 397) Q2W (MOBILITY, NCT01061736). Efficacy and patient-reported outcomes were compared between and within groups according to IL-6 tertile using linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: In MONARCH, patients with high baseline IL-6 (n = 100; all ‚â•3√óupper limit of normal) had higher disease activity at baseline than those with low IL-6 (n = 100). The magnitude of clinical improvement over 24 weeks with sarilumab versus adalimumab was greater in patients with high baseline IL-6 than patients with low baseline IL-6. In MOBILITY, patients with high IL-6 (n = 398) had higher disease activity and joint damage at baseline than those with low IL-6 (n = 397), were more likely to have joint progression, and had less clinical improvement over 52 weeks' treatment with placebo+methotrexate compared with sarilumab 150/200 mg+methotrexate. Baseline IL-6 and C-reactive protein were both predictive of outcomes. Safety profiles were similar between defined IL-6 tertiles. CONCLUSION: IL-6 may be a prognostic marker of disease progression and severity, and patients with high IL-6 may be likely to benefit from sarilumab compared with adalimumab or methotrexate. Prospective validation is warranted to confirm the results of these post hoc analyses."

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (teaes) was greater with sarilumab than placebo. The most common teaes were infections, neutropenia, injection-site reactions, and increased transaminases. In the present study, efficacy of sarilumab across prespecified subpopulations from MOBILITY was assessed. Methods: the MOBILITY study design and methods have previously been reported.1 incidence of ACR20 at week 24 and leastsquares mean difference in change from baseline in HAQ-DI at week 16, coprimary endpoints in MOBILITY, were evaluated for placebo (n=398), sarilumab 150 mg q2w (n=400), and sarilumab 200 mg q2w (n=399) in prespecified subpopulations. Treatment-bysubgroup interactions were assessed by a logistic regression model for ACR20 at week 24 and by a mixed-effect model for repeated measures for HAQ-DI at week 16. Results: no treatment-by-subgroup interactions were observed in the proportion of patients achieving ACR20 response at week 24 (table), indicating that, across all subgroups, the efficacy of sarilumab was consistent with the overall study findings. There appeared to BE a trend toward lower efficacy in patients with increasing weight and BMI, particularly in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w group (figure). No treatment-by-subgroup interactions were observed for HAQ-DI improvements at week 16, and the trends observed with ACR20 response in regards to lower efficacy with increased weight and BMI were not observed. Conclusion: aCR20 and HAQ-DI responses with sarilumab were generally consistent across all subgroups in MOBILITY, although ACR20 responses may BE decreased in patients with increasing weight and BMI.

Patients were randomized to high dosage (20 mg/week) or low dosage (7.5 mg/week) MTX; all patients received 40 mg open-label ADA every other week for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was Week 24 mean 28-joint Disease Activity Score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) to test for noninferiority of low-dosage MTX using a 15% margin. US images were scored using a 10-joint semiquantitative system incorporating OMERACT definitions for pathology, assessing synovial hypertrophy, vascularity, and bony erosions.
RESULTS: rapid improvement in clinical indices was observed in both groups after addition of ADA. The difference in mean DAS28-CRP (0.37, 95% CI 0.07-0.66) comparing low-dosage (4.12, 95% CI 3.88-4.34) versus high-dosage MTX (3.75, 95% CI 3.52-3.97) was statistically significant and non-inferiority was not met.

11085193,,10.1055/s-0040-1702098,"Background: Hypertension (HT) is the most pervasive disease worldwide, causing multiple chronic conditions without apparent symptoms. Global burden of disease is extremely high due to HT. The Framingham study tells us that about 90% of people after the age of 65 years have a lifetime risk of developing HT. The aetiology of hypertension is various and complex, involving both genetic and behavioural factors. More and more people experience increased anger, anxiety and depression brought on by globalization, cultural changes, socioeconomic changes, and stress at the work place. Anger is a critical contributing factor in essential hypertension (EHT). In our research, we tried to correlate anger with EHT and to treat anger - and thus the level of hypertension - with homeopathic simillimum. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between level of anger and level of hypertension. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of homeopathic treatment on anger - and thereby on blood pressure (BP) - in comparison with standard care treatment for hypertension. Methods: 300 patients with EHT were screened, 172 of whom (108 men, 64 women) were enrolled after informed, voluntary consent. They were divided into two equal groups by simple randomisation. After thorough case-taking, all patients were advised regarding DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), life-style modification and antihypertensives, as per individual requirements. The STAXI-2 scale was applied to measure anger at the beginning and after six months'study period. One group was kept on placebo and the other on individualised homeopathic medicine. Regular follow-up was every two weeks. Data generated was analysed by SPSS v.21. Results: Except state anger and its components, all other variables of anger, as well as systolic and diastolic BP, were remarkably reduced (p < 0.001) by homeopathy. Also, 89% of patients in the homeopathy group experienced relief in the symptoms of co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, gastroesophageal reflux disorder and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Standard care with anti-hypertensives had little impact on anger or the general psychopathology of patients, and had no effect on co-morbidities. Conclusion: The patients treated with individualised homeopathic treatment showed statistically significant improvement in anger and hypertension, and also showed notable relief in the symptoms of co-morbidities."
9738035,,10.3899/jrheum.171232,"OBJECTIVE: Obese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) report more joint swelling and tenderness and often have poorer responses to therapy than nonobese patients. The aim of this posthoc analysis of the MUSICA trial was to compare imaging and clinical disease activity measures in obese and nonobese patients with RA., METHODS: MUSICA evaluated methotrexate (MTX) 20 mg/week versus 7.5 mg/week in combination with adalimumab (ADA) in RA patients with an inadequate response to MTX. Patients were categorized by baseline body mass index as normal (< 25), overweight (>= 25 to < 30), or obese (>= 30). Synovial vascularity and hypertrophy, swollen and tender joint counts (SJC and TJC), American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses, and low disease activity (LDA), defined as Clinical Disease Activity Index < 10 and 28-joint count Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) < 3.2, were assessed at weeks 12 and 24., RESULTS: Patient characteristics were similar among groups at baseline. Obese patients had numerically smaller changes from baseline to weeks 12/24 in SJC, TJC, DAS28-CRP, and synovial hypertrophy and vascularity versus nonobese patients. Significantly fewer obese patients reached ACR20/50 at weeks 12 and 24, and LDA at Week 12; this difference was especially apparent in patients receiving 7.5 mg/week MTX but was no longer significant at Week 24., CONCLUSION: Obese patients with RA had worse clinical and ultrasonographic responses than nonobese patients, which were partly overcome with time. Obese patients may experience better and faster clinical improvements if ADA is initiated with high-dose (20 mg/week) rather than low-dose MTX. [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01185288]."

The aim of the study was to compare mid-term clinical, radiological, and survival outcomes of SR and MR posterior-stabilized prostheses in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Two hundred consecutive patients who underwent TKA between January 2012 and July 2013 were enrolled in the SR group (100 patients) and an MR group (100 patients), with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Functional, radiological, satisfaction, and survival rates were evaluated. There was a significantly higher range of motion (ROM) in the SR group than in the MR group (flexion, 123.65 +/- 10.12 degrees vs. 115.52 +/- 10.03 degrees, p < 0.001). Quadriceps strength (3.05 +/- 0.43 vs. 2.68 +/- 0.58 kg, p = 0.025) and chair test results (80 [93.02%] vs. 69 [83.13%], p = 0.027) were better in the SR group than in the MR group. The SR group also had significantly less anterior knee pain (6 [6.98%] vs. 15 [18.07%], p < 0.05) and a better satisfaction rate than those in the MR group. No significant differences were observed in clinical scale scores such as Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), Knee Society Score (KSS), and Short-Form 12 (SF-12), radiological results in terms of component position and radiolucent lines. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimates at 5 years were not significantly different (96.91% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.5-99.5%] vs. 94.86% [95% CI: 90.6-98.6%], p = 0.4696). The SR prosthesis design was better than that of the MR in terms of ROM, reduced anterior knee pain, contributions to better recovery of the extension mechanism, and higher satisfaction rates. The SR had similar results in clinical scales such as HSS, KSS, SF-12, radiological, or survival results to MR prostheses. More accurate measurements and longer-term follow-up are required.Copyright ¬© 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved."

Presently, RA is mainly treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biological agents; however, they offer limited efficacy in some patients. Therefore, additional therapeutic strategies need to be developed. Yishen Tongbi decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation widely used to treat RA in China. However, currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use for the treatment of RA. Therefore, we aim to verify the efficacy of Yishen Tongbi decoction to treat RA by a noninferiority trial, and to provide a basis for its use with a full-scale clinical trial., METHODS/DESIGN: One hundred eligible patients with RA will be randomized into two groups of 50 patients. One group will receive Yishen Tongbi decoction and placebo replacing methotrexate (MTX), while the other group will receive MTX and placebo replacing Yishen Tongbi decoction. Patient's whose visual analogue scale score for pain is greater than 40 mm will be administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as enteric-coated diclofenac sodium, 25 mg three times a day); administration of all medications will be recorded. The clinical indicators of patients and their disease activity will be assessed at baseline and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment initiation. The primary outcome of efficacy will be the proportion of patients who demonstrate a favourable response based on their Clinical Disease Activity Index score at 24 weeks after treatment. All adverse events will be reported., DISCUSSION: Traditional Chinese medicine theory and modern western medicine research have identified the efficacy of Yishen Tongbi decoction to treat RA. Previous clinical observation and efficacy trials of Yishen Tongbi decoction in animal models for the treatment of RA has demonstrated significant effect. Because of the potential benefits of Yishen Tongbi decoction in the treatment of patients with RA, we designed this double-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial; the results and conclusions of the trail will be published after the completion of the study., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trials Registry, ChiCTR1900024902.

Both studies were followed by open-label extension (OLE) studies with OKZ 120 mg every 2 weeks, RA0057 and RA0089, respectively. Safety assessments were reported up to 124 weeks in RA0057 and 92 weeks in RA0089. Efficacy assessments were reported up to week 60 in RA0057 and week 52 in RA0089. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed, and missing data were not imputed., RESULTS: A total of 190 patients in RA0057 and 103 patients in RA0089 received OKZ with median treatment duration of 14.1 and 10.1 months, respectively. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 44 patients (23.2%, 32.7 events per 100 patient-years [PY]) in RA0057 and in 13 patients (12.6%, 23.6 events per 100 PY) in RA0089. Among treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including SAEs, infections were the most common events. TEAEs leading to withdrawal were reported in 33 (17.4%) patients in RA0057 and in 7 (6.8%) patients in RA0089. Disease activity score 28-joint count on the basis of C-reactive protein level, clinical disease activity index, and simplified disease activity index, as well as the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, and 70% response rates were maintained during the OLE studies, including in those who switched from PBO or TCZ. Improvements in patient-reported outcomes were maintained in OLEs as well., CONCLUSION: In the 2 long-term studies, OKZ treatment demonstrated a safety profile expected for IL-6 blocking agents without new safety signals and led to sustained improvements in RA symptoms, physical function, and quality of life."
11085230,,10.2352/issn.2470-1173.2018.01.vda-332,"Purpose Regular physical activity and non-sedentary lifestyle are important for 300,000 Canadians who suffer from Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). A non-sedentary lifestyle improves their condition and reduces the risk of other comorbidities. Physiotherapists and rheumatologists often prescribe a physical activity plan for patients with RA. However, it is hard for patients to keep a detailed record of their physical activity and non-sedentary behaviour throughout the day. Wearable devices can help, but existing consumer devices like Fitbit do not allow any modification, such as customizing the physical activity plan to suit the physical abilities of a patient with mobility issues. Methods We developed a new technology that repurposes the online advertisement space with reminders for each patient to maintain a non-sedentary lifestyle. We developed a Chrome extension which identifies the advertisements on websites such as Facebook, YouTube and Amazon, and replaces those advertisements with personalized reminders to be active. The FitVizweb application downloads a patientas Fitbitdataand determines progress towards non-sedentary goals. The progress is then sent to the FitViz-Ad extension which replaces the online advertisements with reminders to move throughout the day. We conducted an initial 2-week usability study with 14 healthy individuals as participants. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: The control group and the intervention group. The control group did not use the Chrome extension. The intervention group, on the other hand, used the Chrome extension for two weeks. At the end of the study, we compared the change in step counts and the number of hours in a day spent as non-sedentary. We also conducted a semi-structured interview to better understand the experience of using the FitViz-Ad Chrome extension. Results We did not observe a significant change in the step counts before and after the study between the control group (M = 7508.93, SD = 2423.88) and intervention group (M = 6625.48, SD = .1891.63); t(10) = ?0.7, p = 0.5). The nonsedentary hour data was not normally distributed and the Wilcoxon test revealed no significant difference in the number of non-sedentary hours W(1) = 32.5, Z = ?0.965, p = 0.295. Participants reported an increase in awareness about Physical Activity. One participant said: a[a]But when I started using the app [extension] and I was working, like it was reminding me on a constant basis that Iam not moving. So I knewa like I was aware and I think itas important to just know and like sometimes aoh Iam so tired but cause I didnat get up.a ll except 2 participants in the intervention group found the reminders to be non-intrusive. However, participants expressed desire to be able to customize the reminder pop-up. Current efforts focus on improving the design of the FitViz ads and enabling patients to choose the type of reminder. A second usability study that involves RA patients is planned. Conclusions Our results show that the design of the FitViz-Ad can be a on-intrusive reminder for rheumatoid arthritis patients to remind and support their Physical Activities."
11085264,,10.1097/gox.0000000000003373,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also called scleroderma, is a rare chronic autoimmune disease that, can have a wide range of cutaneous, joint, and internal organ involvement. In the skin, SSc, is characterized by enhanced fibroblast activity leading to hypertrophic dermal collagen that, results in thickened, less flexible skin. (Hassani, 2016) SSc is often divided into two types, based on extent of cutaneous involvement: diffuse SSc and limited SSc. The hand is a frequent, area of involvement in both subtypes of SSc. Hand disability in SSc leads to a high burden on, quality of life for patients as it limits both work and activities of daily living. Treatment, for hand sclerosis remains limited with generally progressive disease despite aggressive, treatment with anti-fibrotic medications, immunosuppressive agents, and topical approaches., Specific hand therapies include physiotherapy and injections of autologous adipose-derived, stromal vascular fraction into the fingers with some success. (Guillaume-Jugnot, 2016; Liem,, 2019), Ultraviolet therapy has been used in dermatology for several decades. UVA-1 is a form of, phototherapy that utilizes the longest wavelengths in the UV spectrum from 340-400 nm. It is, able to penetrate deeper in the skin than other types of phototherapy and target different, types of cells including fibroblasts. In sclerosing skin conditions UVA-1 appears to be, superior to other forms of UV light. Medium to high dose UVA-1 also appears to be superior to, low dose UVA-1 for sclerosing conditions. (Kreuter 2006)., UVA-1 has been reported to be beneficial to skin changes in SSc in several case reports and a, few small studies. (Jacobe 2020) Interpretation of these reports has been difficult based on, the small numbers of subjects involved and the non-blinded non-randomized nature of the, reports. In a single controlled study with half-side comparison of 9 patients, the, investigators could not demonstrate improvement with UVA-1 in the treated hand. (Thomas 2007), This study was limited by a small number of patients and the long disease duration prior to, treatment (mean of 13 years). A more recent report of a patient with SSc for 2.5 years and, severe acrosclerosis that responded to 21 sessions of UVA-1 with improved mobility and, functionality renews interest in this treatment modality. (Cuenca-Barrales 2019), If UVA1 therapy can significantly improve hand involvement in SSc with regards to, functionality and disability, it may be a cost-effective and beneficial treatment for this, patient segment with debilitating disease., Purpose and Objectives:, 1. To assess the efficacy of 30 sessions of ultraviolet-1 (UVA1) therapy in treating hand, involvement of SSc in a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, intra-patient,, UV-blocking glove-controlled, crossover clinical trial., 1. To compare improvement in hand function as measured by the Hand Mobility in, Scleroderma (HAMIS) test, in the UVA1-treated hand compared to control hand, (gloved)., 2. To compare the improvement in hand function as measured by the Cochin hand, functional disability scale (CHFDS) in the UVA1-treated hand compared to control, hand (gloved)., 3. To compare the improvement in skin hardening based on durometer measurements in the, UVA1-treated hand compared to control hand (gloved)., 4. To measure improvement in the physician measure of skin thickness on hands and, fingers (0-3) scale after completion of 30 UVA1 sessions., 5. To assess the duration of response after a complete 30-treatment course at 3 and12, months post treatment using the HAMIS, CHFDS, durometer, and physician skin, thickness assessment., 2. Assess patient-reported outcomes before, during and after treatment using Skindex-16,, Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ), PROMIS-Physical Function (PROMIS-PF), Hand Disability, in Systemic Sclerosis - Digital Ulcers(HDISS-DU) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS)., Study Design:, This study will use a single-blind, prospective, randomized (dominant/non-dominant hand), comparator design to assess the effect of high dose (80-120 J/cm2) UVA1 therapy on hand, function in scleroderma in a paired t-test design. This study will be placebo-controlled, (with a UV-blocking gloved hand), cross-over, randomized clinical trial. Following the, initial treatment period (30 treatments), patients will have the option to undergo the same, high dose UVA1 treatment protocol on the untreated control hand. A follow up period of 12, months following completion of UVA1 therapy will prospectively follow patients to monitor for, relapse of their disease to assess the durability of the clinical response to UVA1 therapy on, hand scleroderma., Inclusion criteria:, -  Must be able to understand and provide written informed consent, -  Scleroderma skin involvement affecting both hands approximately equally, -  Age of at least 18-years-old, -  Male or female, -  Ability to engage in twice weekly UVA1 sessions, -  No changes in systemic therapy during the first 100 days of the study period, Exclusion criteria:, -  On photosensitizing medication, -  Inability to complete study visits, -  UV light therapy in the 4 weeks prior to entering the study, -  Commercial tanning or excessive sun exposure in the 4 weeks prior to entering the study, -  Current pregnancy or planned pregnancy during the study period, -  Use of topical therapies other than emollients (suprapotent corticosteroids) in the 2, weeks prior to entering the study, -  History of intolerance to ultraviolet light, -  Any other condition that will disqualify the patient from the study in the opinion of, the investigator, Procedures:, This is a single-blinded, randomized, UV-blocking glove controlled, dominant/non-dominant, hand, cross-over study to determine the efficacy of UVA1 in the treatment of hand, scleroderma. Each participant will have at least one hand treated with UVA1 during the active, treatment period of the study. The study will be performed at the University of Utah, Dermatology Department using both the University of Utah E12 Clinic space as well as the, Midvalley Clinic space. UVA1 lights boxes are located at both E12 and Midvalley locations., Personnel involved in the study will include the PI, the co-investigators, and the study, coordinators. Approximately 27 patients will be enrolled to account for a 25% drop-out rate., The number needed to treat to show a difference in the treatment vs. control hands is 21. The, study timeline is summarized in Table 1., Screening:, For screening, subjects with qualifying scleroderma involving both hands will be asked to, read and sign the informed consent document. They will be reminded that they are to take, their time and, if necessary, take it home for further consideration. Questions will be, answered. Those meeting inclusion / exclusion criteria who have signed informed consent will, be enrolled., After answering questions and prior to the first treatment the Principal Investigator (PI), will examine the entire patient and assess for the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis with, bilateral hand involvement and perform the following assessments: HAMIS, CHFDS, durometer, measurements, and mRSS. (Please see efficacy assessment section for details of HAMIS, CHFDS,, durometer, and mRSS). Photographs of the hands and other affected areas will be taken. The, patient will be asked to identify their dominant (writing) hand and their answer will be, noted. Using a random number generator, the patient will be randomized to undergo UVA1, treatment vs UV-blocking glove (control) on the dominant hand. The non-dominant hand will, receive the other modality. A study coordinator will perform the randomization on the day of, first treatment and the PI will be blinded to the treatment assignment., UVA1 Treatments:, Blinding:, A UV-blocking glove will be placed on the control hand as determined by the randomization, process. Subjects will wear eyewear that occludes external light., Evaluations for adverse effects will be carried out by the UVA1 operator (a nurse not, involved in any assessments) and the blinded investigator at prescribed intervals. Evaluation, of UVA1 efficacy on hand scleroderma will be assessed by a trained and experienced evaluator, who is blinded as to the UVA1-treated side (covered / not covered). The efficacy evaluations, will be carried out prior to treatments on days both evaluations and treatments are, completed. After participants have been evaluated at the 3-month post-treatment study visit, the blinded evaluator will become unblinded to the UVA1-treated side for the purpose of, allowing participants to receive standard of care therapy. Therefore, participants will be, allowed to receive additional UVA-1 treatments to one or both hands in addition to any other, necessary standard of care treatments after the 3-month post-treatment visit., Dosing Schedule:, Prior studies with UVA1 have shown that high and medium dose protocols (>40-120 J/cm2) are, more effective than low dose (20-40 J/cm2) to treat sclerosing skin conditions. (Hassani,, 2016) Thus, we will set the initiation dose at 50 J. The hands will be positioned, approximately 9 inches from the bulbs. The palmar surface of the hand will be exposed for, half the treatment and the dorsal surface for half the treatment. If tolerating well after, three treatments, the dose will be increased to 60 J for three treatments and then 70 J for, the remaining treatments., Patients will return to clinic two-to-three times per week for 30 treatments over a 100-day, period to receive UVA1 treatments. If the patient experiences redness, burning, pain, or, blistering at the treatment site, treatment will be held if active symptoms persist at the, time of the next scheduled treatment. If the symptoms have resolved and the patient has, healed by the next scheduled treatment, the UVA1 energy will be reduced by 10 J of the, previously delivered dose. Dose escalation will then proceed by increasing the UVA1 energy, after three well tolerated treatments., Evaluations:, 1. Efficacy evaluations will be performed at baseline, after 15 UVA1 treatment sessions,, after 30 UVA1 treatment sessions, and at 3 and 12 months after completion of all UVA1, treatments. For each evaluation prior to the 12-month evaluation, one of the, sub-Investigators who is blinded to the treatment assignments will generate and record the, HAMIS, CHFDS, Durometer, and mRSS. Hands will be photographed. Patients will complete all, PROM including using Skindex-16, Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ), PROMIS-Physical Function, (PROMIS-PF), Hand Disability in Systemic Sclerosis - Digital Ulcers(HDISS-DU), and Visual, Analog Scale (VAS)., The blinded evaluator will also perform safety evaluation and document study-related adverse, events., 1. Primary Efficacy Measure:, The efficacy will be measured using the HAMIS test score to assess for improvement over, time and as compared to the untreated hand. The primary endpoint will be assessed after, 30 UVA1 treatments. The primary endpoint is improvement in HAMIS score as compared to, the untreated hand after 30 UVA1 treatment sessions., 2. Secondary Efficacy Measures:, Secondary efficacy measures include HAMIS test score improvement from baseline in treated and, untreated hands after 30 UVA1 treatment sessions, as well as changes in CHFDS, Durometer, measures, mRSS, Skindex-16, MHQ, PROMIS-PF, and VAS scores between baseline and after 30 UVA1, treatment sessions and (when applicable) between treated and untreated hands. Other secondary, efficacy measures include change in HAMIS test scores CHFDS, Durometer measures, Physician, assessment, Skindex-16, MHQ, PROMIS-PF, HDISS-DU, and VAS scores between completion of 30, UVA1 treatments and 3 and 12 months post-treatment in both hands as compared to baseline and, after 30 UVA1 treatment sessions in each hand. Secondary endpoint measures also include time, to disease worsening after treatment as defined by a 3-point (, 10%) increase in HAMIS scores, post-treatment., Endpoint measure descriptions:, HAMIS is a hand function test developed for adults with systemic sclerosis. HAMIS consists of, 9 items designed to measure all movements assessed in an ordinary range of motion, (ROM)-measured hand test. Specific items test finger flexion and extension, thumb abduction,, pincer grip, finger abduction/swelling, dorsal extension and volar extension of the wrist,, and pronation and supination. Each item is graded on a 0-3 scale, where 0 corresponds to, normal function and 3 denotes that the individual is unable to perform the item. Each hand is, assessed separately. The minimum score for HAMIS is 0, representing normal hand function. The, maximum score of HAMIS is 27, representing a high degree of dysfunction. (Sandqvist, 2000), The CHFDS is a questionnaire with 18 questions concerning daily living activities,, administered by a clinician, which each question scored on a scale from 0 (performed without, difficulty) to 5 (impossible to do). The total score is obtained by adding the scores from, all items (range 0-90), with lower scores indicating normal function and higher scores, indicating poor function. This test was developed for rheumatoid arthritis but has been, validated in scleroderma. (Rannaou, 2007), A Durometer is an instrument for testing the hardness of various materials. It has been used, in scleroderma to measure the hardness of affected skin as compared to normal skin., The physician assessment on skin thickness on the hand and fingers based on the modified, Rodnan skin score (mRSS) which is a standard outcome measure for skin disease in systemic, sclerosis. The score is calculated by evaluating the skin thickness at 17 different body, sites. Each site is graded from 0 to 3, with 0 representing normal skin and 3 representing, severe skin thickness. The score is calculated by adding the scores at each site to arrive at, a total score ranging from 0 (normal) to 51 (severe disease). (Khanna, 2017) In this study we, will only calculate the score for the hands and fingers. Total possible score of 6 on each, hand., Skindex-16 is a 16-item validated assessment for the patient to identify the impact of their, skin disease on three quality of life domains: symptoms, emotions, and physical functioning., Scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale with 0 representing no impact on quality of life and, 100 representing maximal impact., The Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ) is a 37-item validated instrument exploring, hand-specific outcomes across six domains: overall hand function, activities of daily living, (ADLs), pain, work performance, aesthetics, and patient satisfaction with hand function. It, asks questions separately about each hand, allowing for comparisons between hands. The raw, score is converted to a 0-100 scale. For pain, a higher score indicates more pain, but for, the other five scales, higher scores indicate better hand performance. The score for the, affected hand is obtained by selecting either the right or the left hand score., Hand Disability in Systemic Sclerosis - Digital Ulcers(HDISS-DU) is a patient reported, outcome measure developed to capture the full spectrum of symptoms and disability related to, digital ulcers, which are common and debilitating in scleroderma involving the hands. The, instrument consists of 24 items. Responses are scored from 1 to 6 (6 scores), where 1 is, 'yes, without difficulty', 2 is 'yes, with a little difficulty', 3 is 'yes, with some, difficulty', 4 is 'yes with much difficulty', 5 is 'nearly impossible to do' and 'used, unaffected hand only' (both responses were assigned the same score), and 6 is 'impossible'., The eighth response option 'did not do this activity in the past 7 days' is scored as, missing. The overall HDISSDU score is calculated as the mean of non-missing item scores (with, a missing data threshold of < 12 items) and ranged from a minimum score of 1 to a maximum, score of 6, with increasing score corresponding to increasing disability., PROMIS Physical Function (PROMIS-PF) is a computer adaptive test (CAT), wherein initial, screening questions guide the need for additional questions following an iterative algorithm., For example, if a patient is unable to walk 100 feet without resting, an additional question, about jogging 1 mile would not be asked. A weighted t-score results based on national, averages with 50 as the mean score; >50 means higher physical function, <50 means lower, physical function., All PROs (Skindex-16, MHQ, PROMIS-PF) will be collected electronically at every visit."

The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in patients (pts) with polyarticular course (pc)JIA were demonstrated in a Phase 3 trial. Objective(s): To assess tofacitinib efficacy/safety in pts with pcJIA, stratified by concomitant methotrexate (MTX) use and prior exposure to biologic (b)DMARDs. Method(s): This post hoc analysis included data from pts with pcJIA aged 2-<18 years in a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled withdrawal study. Pts received tofacitinib 5 mg BID or body weight-based lower equivalent dose. Pts achieving >=JIA/ ACR30 response at Week (W)18 were randomised 1:1 to continue tofacitinib or switch to PBO to W44. Here, pts were analysed in subgroups: concomitant MTX use on study Day 1 (yes/no) and prior bDMARD exposure (yes/no). Efficacy for tofacitinib vs PBO was assessed to W44, by subgroup: JIA flare rate; JIA/ACR50/70/90 response and JIA/ACR inactive disease (ID) rates; and least squares mean (LSM) change from W18 (delta) in JADAS27-CRP. Safety with tofacitinib was assessed throughout, by subgroup. Result(s): 184 pts with pcJIA received tofacitinib to W18, when pts were randomised to receive tofacitinib (n=72) or PBO (n=70). Of these pts, 106 received concomitant MTX and 43 had prior bDMARD exposure. Across subgroups, most pts were female and white, and mean age ranged from 10.9-12.9 years. JIA flare rate was lower and JIA/ACR50/70/90 response and JIA/ACR-ID rates were higher with tofacitinib vs PBO at W44 across subgroups (Table). The greatest differences between treatments were in pts who did not use concomitant MTX and those with prior bDMARD exposure. Across subgroups, JADAS27-CRP improved or was stable at W44 vs W18 in pts receiving tofacitinib; scores worsened with PBO, most evidently in pts with prior bDMARD exposure (Table). AEs and serious AEs, respectively, occurred in: 72.9% and 3.0% (+MTX); 88.2% and 3.9% (-MTX); 80.3% and 4.5% (prior bDMARDs); and 75.4% and 2.5% (no prior bDMARDs) of pts. The most common AEs, by system organ class, were infections in all subgroups (43.6-58.8% of pts). AEs of special interest occurred at a low frequency across subgroups; overall, 1.6% had hepatic events, 1.1% had herpes zoster (all events nonserious) and 1.6% had serious infections. No pts died, nor had opportunistic infections (including TB), malignancies, macrophage activation syndrome, MACE, GI perforations, interstitial lung disease or thrombotic events. Conclusion(s): In pts with pcJIA, tofacitinib was efficacious irrespective of concomitant MTX use or prior bDMARD exposure. Tofacitinib safety in all subgroups was generally consistent with the overall Phase 3 study population. The analysis is limited by the small sample size in the subgroups."

The study aimed to examine and compare Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of patients with RA. The study was a clinical trial in which Fifty-seven patients with RA were randomly assigned to the three groups of MBSR, CBT, and control group (treatment as usual). Data were collected using the Chalder Fatigue Scale, Pittsburg Sleep quality, Tower of London test, and Activity disease (DAS-28) in three stages: baseline, post-treatment, and Follow-up. The data were analyzed using a mixed repeated-measures analysis of variance. At post-treatment, both MBSR and CBT groups were significantly more effective than the control group on all variables (P .05). According to the results, in the post-test and Follow-up stages, the mean of chronic fatigue and sleep quality in the intervention groups (MBSR and CBT) was significantly lower than in the control group; also, concerning the executive performance variable, in the post-test stage, the average executive performance in the CBT group was significantly higher than the control group and in the Follow-up stage, the average of both intervention groups was significantly higher than the control group. Therefore, in general, it can be concluded that MBSR and CBT treatments had a significant effect on all variables (sleep quality, chronic fatigue, and executive function) except disease activity.Copyright ¬© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
11085273,,10.55563/clinexprheumatol/k0ctlf,"OBJECTIVES: To assess differences in the strength of inhibition of IL-6/STAT3 signalling induced by subcutaneously (sc) administered tocilizumab (TCZ) and sarilumab (SAR)., METHODS: Data were collected on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who achieved low disease activity (Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI]<=10) following treatment with weekly or bi-weekly administration of 162 mg sc of TCZ (TCZ qw group, n=8; TCZ q2w group, n=8), bi-weekly doses of 200 mg sc of SAR (SAR q2w group, n=7), or MTX (n=8) as a control. The clinical characteristics of each group were collected, and the serum concentrations of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) were measured using ELISA. Whole blood samples from each group were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of IL-6. The proportion of phosphorylated (p)STAT3-positive CD4+ T cells was measured using phosflow cytometric analysis., RESULTS: The proportion of pSTAT3-positive CD4+ T cells following stimulation with 100 ng/ml of recombinant human IL-6 was significantly different among the groups (median 1.8% [0.9-3.0] vs. 7.7% [2.9-8.0] vs. 12.5% [11.4-16.6] vs. 71.5% [68.0-78.5] for the TCZ qw, SAR q2w, TCZ q2w, and MTX control groups, respectively; p<0.01 for all comparisons)., CONCLUSIONS: SAR 200 mg q2w showed significantly stronger inhibition of IL-6/STAT3 signalling than TCZ sc q2w but weaker inhibition than TCZ sc qw. The results of this study may be useful for adjusting the IL-6 blockade treatment for patients with RA."
11085281,,10.2165/00128413-200414230-00013,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting 1% of the, population. Aggressive treatment is a fundamental therapeutic strategy to improve, disease-related outcomes and cardiovascular disease, which contributes to excess mortality in, RA. Thus, therapeutics targeting novel pathways that treat RA and reduce cardiovascular risk, are needed. A potential target is blocking the proinflammatory, immunogenic, and, proatherogenic consequences of isolevuglandins (isoLGs)., IsoLGs are highly reactive dicarbonyl products of oxidative stress that bind covalently to, proteins causing conformational changes rendering them immunogenic and proinflammatory. Two, decades of work at Vanderbilt led to the identification of 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) as a, highly effective scavenger of reactive dicarbonyls such as isoLGs. Scavenging reactive, dicarbonyls is preferable to using antioxidants because reactive oxygen species are necessary, for normal cellular function. In animal models of autoimmunity, hypertension, and, atherosclerosis 2-HOBA reduced inflammation, autoantibodies, blood pressure, and, atherosclerosis, and in human phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers 2-HOBA was well, tolerated., In this phase 2 study we will randomize up to 32 subjects with RA meeting inclusion/exclusion, criteria to 750mg 2-HOBA or matching placebo three times a day for 4 weeks.

However, from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, the cost-effectiveness of triple therapy versus bDMARD treatment sequences as a first-line therapy for patients with RA is still unclear., METHODS: An individual patient simulation model was used to extrapolate the lifetime cost and health outcomes by tracing patients from initial treatment through switches to further treatment lines in a sequence. Therapeutic efficacy and physical function were evaluated using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response, 28-Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28), and Health Assessment Questionnaire score. All input parameters in the model were derived from published studies, national databases, local hospitals, and experts' opinions. Both direct costs and indirect costs were taken into consideration. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to test the uncertainty of the model, as were multiple scenario analyses., RESULTS: The lifetime analysis demonstrated that triple therapy was associated with lower costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) than bDMARD sequences. These resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from $87,090/QALY to $104,032/QALY, higher than the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold in China ($30,950/QALY). The baseline DAS28 impacted the model outcomes the most. Scenario analyses indicated that adding triple therapy to bDMARD sequences as a first-, second-, third-, or fourth-line therapy is very cost-effective, at a WTP of $10,316/QALY., CONCLUSIONS: From a Chinese payer perspective, triple therapy as first-line treatment in treatment sequence could be regarded as cost-effectiveness option for patients who failed MTX, compared to bDMARDs as first-line treatment, and instead of prescribing triple therapy as a substitute for bDMARDs as a first-line treatment, adding triple therapy to the bDMARD treatment sequence is likely to be very cost-effective for patients with active RA compared to bDMARD sequences."
11085299,,10.2169/internalmedicine.3934-19,"Objective To investigate the clinical outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who discontinued infliximab (IFX) treatment at our hospital. Methods Among 249 patients receiving IFX from 2007 to 2015, we retrospectively investigated the clinical courses of 18 who discontinued IFX after achieving the 28-joint disease activity score based on the erythrocyte sedimentation (DAS28-ESR) clinical remission (CR) and whose clinical courses were available continuously for 96 weeks after discontinuation. Results At IFX introduction, the median age was 56.9 (range 36.1-72.4) years, and the disease duration was 5.2 (0.4-25.6) years. The median duration of maintaining either CR or a low disease activity (LDA) with IFX was 37.2 (4.0-91.4) months, and the total duration of IFX therapy was 45.8 (17.1-96.9) months. After discontinuation, 8 patients (44.4%) maintained CR/LDA for 96 weeks (no-flare group), and 10 (55.6%) experienced flares (DAS28-ESR>=3.2) within 96 weeks (flare group). In the no-flare group, six patients receiving intensified conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD) therapy to prevent flare ups simultaneously either with or immediately after discontinuing IFX. In the flare group, four patients received intensified csDMARD therapy. Six patients restarted biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), and all achieved CR again. Ultimately, 12 patients (66.7%) maintained a Bio-free disease control for 96 weeks. A comparison of the clinical backgrounds between the flare and no-flare groups showed no marked difference in their disease duration, IFX dosage, duration of maintaining CR with IFX, or concomitant csDMARDs use. Conclusion Irrespective of the RA disease duration, more than half of all patients maintained a Bio-free condition for 96 weeks. Continuing LDA with IFX for a sufficiently long period of time before discontinuation and preventive intensification of csDMARD therapy may help maintain a Bio-free condition."

The aim of the study was to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid action. Method(s): In a randomized, crossover, single-blind, discovery study, 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency (and no other endocrinopathies) were admitted at the in-patient clinic and studied during physiological glucocorticoid exposure and withdrawal. A randomization plan before the first intervention was used. Besides mild physical and/or mental fatigue and salt craving, no serious adverse events were observed. The transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNAomic, and serum metabolomics were compared between the interventions using integrated multi-omic analysis. Result(s): We identified a transcriptomic profile derived from two tissues and a multi-omic cluster, both predictive of glucocorticoid exposure. A microRNA (miR-122-5p) that was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoid exposure was identified (p=0.009) and replicated in independent studies with varying glucocorticoid exposure (0.01 <= p<=0.05). Conclusion(s): We have generated results that construct the basis for successful discovery of biomarker(s) to measure effects of glucocorticoids, allowing strategies to individualize and optimize glucocorticoid therapy, and shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure, such as in cardiovascular disease and obesity.Copyright ¬© Chantzichristos et."

This study evaluated whether applying low-energy laser therapy (LLT) on the knee joint could be an effective adjuvant intervention for patients with JIA. Sixty children with polyarticular JIA participated and were randomly allocated to receive either LLT (wavelength lambda = 903 nm; power output of 50 mW; and energy of 1.5 J) plus exercises (LLT group) or exercises alone (control group). Pain, peak concentric torque of quadriceps muscles, fatigue, and functional status were measured by the visual analogue scale, isokinetic testing system, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, respectively pre- and post-intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. Per the mixed-model analysis of variance, the LLT group showed a statistically more favorable improvement in pain (P =.003, etap 2 =.014), fatigue perception (P =.004, etap 2 =.015), and functional status (P =.022, etap 2 =.09) across the three assessment occasions, as compared to the control group. However, no significant difference was demonstrated between both groups concerning peak concentric torque (all P >.05). Incorporation of LLT into the standard physical rehabilitation program for patients with JIA has the potential to induce more conducive improvements in pain, fatigue, and functional performance, but is not effective for improving muscle performance.Copyright ¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are an important basis for evaluating the impact of JIA and associated therapies, however, which is particular challenge in the pediatric setting. At present, no randomized controlled studies have investigated the effect and usability of ePROs symptom management for children with JIA. Method(s): This longitudinal, randomized, controlled trial will be carried out at outpatient and pediatric wards of the Shanghai Children's Medical Center affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. A total of one hundred children with JIA diagnosed according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) patients are randomized to receive individualized symptom management based on ePROs or routine management. The primary outcome is the mean C-Ped-PROMIS T-scores of patients in the ePROs-based group and the control group. The secondary outcomes are the trajectories of C-Ped-PROMIS T-scores and HRQOL scores, and changing relationship between them. Data were collected at 5 time points: at enrollment (""baseline"") and at the time of follow-up visits scheduled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

Safety analyses were performed using the safety analysis set and the exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was calculated. Efficacy was assessed from baseline in the parent studies., RESULTS: Of 790 patients completing the phase II parent studies, 739 enrolled in the study. Through April 2019, 59.5% of patients had received >= 4 years of the study drug. Mean (SD) exposure to filgotinib was 3.55 (1.57) years in the filgotinib + MTX group and 3.38 (1.59) years in the filgotinib monotherapy group. EAIR per 100 patient-years of exposure for TEAEs was 24.6 in the filgotinib + MTX group and 25.8 in the filgotinib monotherapy group, and for serious TEAEs, the EAIR was 3.1 and 4.3, respectively. American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 responses among patients remaining in the study could be maintained through 4 years, with 89.3%/69.6%/49.1% of the filgotinib + MTX group and 91.8%/69.4%/44.4% of the monotherapy group maintaining ACR20/50/70 responses, respectively, based on observed data., CONCLUSION: Filgotinib was well tolerated with a 4-year safety profile comparable to that of the parent trials, both in patients receiving combination therapy with MTX or as monotherapy.

Patients were divided into tertiles according to the burden of AEs. As outcomes, we assessed 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) levels and remission rates at 12 and 24¬¨‚Ä†months. Three hundred thirty-one AEs in 99 patients were reported, and 27 (8%) were categorized as severe or serious. Mean burden of AEs per patient was 5.4‚Äö√Ñ√¢¬¨¬±‚Äö√Ñ√¢4.3.

METHODS: ninety-nine patients with early, DMARD naive RA were treated, aiming at remission, with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, low-dose oral prednisolone and, when needed, IAGCIs for 2 years, and randomised to receive infliximab or placebo from weeks 4 to 26. During each of the 15 study visits, patients were scored retrospectively 0.2-0.4 points (depending on the number of non-injected joints) if IAGCIs to all swollen joints were not given. Patients were divided into tertiles by their cumulative scores for neglected injections (CSNI) over 24 months. 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) area under the curve (AUC) between 0-24 months, remission rates, changes in quality of life, and radiological changes during the follow-up were assessed. Trends across tertiles of CSNI were tested with generalised linear models.
RESULTS: higher CSNI was associated with lower strict remission rates (p=0.005), and lower quality of life (p=0.004) at 24 months, and higher DAS28 AUC (p<0.001) during the follow-up. At 24 months, DAS28 remission rates were 90%, 93% and 76% (p=0.081), and strict remission rates were 74%, 77% and 39% by tertiles of CSNI. No significant differences were observed in radiological progression (p=0.089). IAGCIs were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: neglecting IAGCIs into swollen joints is associated with lower remission rates, higher disease activity, and lower quality of life. Hence, IAGCIs should be used as an integral part of the targeted treatment of early RA."
9263490,,10.3899/jrheum.140267,"Objective. With modern initial aggressive combination treatments with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARD), most patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) achieve remission, have marginal radiographic progression, and sustain normal function. Here we aim to identify the patients failing these targets even after aggressive treatment. Methods. Ninety-nine patients with early, active RA were treated with a combination of 3 sDMARD and prednisolone (PRD), and either infliximab or placebo infusions during the first 6 months, aiming at strict remission. After 24 months, the treatments became unrestricted. At 60 months, 4 evident clinical features of treatment failure were defined: area under curve (AUC) between 6-60 months for disease activity score assessing 28 joints > 2.6; AUC 6-60 for health assessment questionnaire > 0.5; progression in total Sharp/van der Heijde score 0-60 months > 3 units; and need of PRD or biologic DMARD treatment at 60 months. Results. A total of 93 patients were followed up for 60 months. Of them, 45 had no features of treatment failure, 30 had 1, 10 had 2, 7 had 3, and 1 patient had all 4 features. Having 2-4 features of treatment failure at 5 years was predicted by the health assessment score at baseline, and by even low residual disease activity at 3 and 6 months. Conclusions. Only 20% of the patients with RA treated early with combination sDMARD and PRD have more than 1 clinical feature of treatment failure at 60 months. Residual clinical disease activity at 3-6 months was the most important predictor for identifying these patients. The study was registered at www.clintrials.gov (NCT00908089)."

9738932,,10.1371/journal.pone.0183294,"Background: We have previously reported a 37% remission rate in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with a combination therapy with 3 DMARDs and prednisolone (the FIN-RACo treatment strategy). Here we set out to study the contribution of infliximab (INFL) added as an induction therapy during the first 6 months in patients with early RA treated with FIN-RACo strategy by using full doses of methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and prednisolone (PRED) (= COMBI) compared with COMBI+ placebo (PLA). Here we report the 2- year clinical and radiological outcome. Methods: In this multicenter (15 centres), randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we enrolled 100 patients aged <65 y with early RA (symptoms <= 12 mo), active (>= 6 swollen and >= 6 tender joints, early morning stiffness >= 45 min and/or ESR >= 30 mm/h and/or CRP520 mg/l). COMBI was started in all patients targeted to remission. The patients were randomized in a double-blind way to receive INFL (3 mg/kg) or PLA at weeks 4 6, 10, 18 and 26. Doses of MTX (max 25 mg) and SSZ (max 2 g) were individually tailored to reach remission. Doses of HCQ (35 mg/ kg/week) and PRED (7.5 mg/day) were constant. Remission was assessed by the strict ACR criteria (no swollen or tender joints), and by DAS28. In cases of inefficacy/intolerability, the DMARDs were substituted, but it was obligatory to use 3 DMARDs and PRED. Local glucocorticoid injections were allowed. Primary outcomes were proportion of patients in remission and radiology. Results: At entry, the mean age (SD) of the patients was 46 y (10), median duration (IQR) of symptoms 4 mo (2, 6), 68% were RF+, and 67% female. Mean number (SD) of swollen joints was 15 (6), tender joints 20 (10), ESR 33 (22) mm/h and HAQ 1.0 (0.7). At 24 months, 62% of the patients were in ACR remission (COMBI+PLA 53%, COMBI+INFL 70%). Remission rate over time was higher in the COMBI+INFL group [OR=1.97 (95% CI: 1.03 to 3.74), p=0.04]. By DAS28 criteria, 85% of the patients were in remission (COMBI+PLA 82%, COMBI+INFL 88%, n.s., over 3-24 months more often in COMBI+INFL (p=0.047). The median total Sharp score (TSS) was 0 in both groups at baseline. At 24 months, 41% of patients in COMBI+PLA and 54% in COMBI+INFL had 0 score. A mean (95% CI) change of TSS from baseline to 24 months was 1.4 (0.8 to 2.2) in COMBI+PLA and -0.2 (-1.1 to 0.4) in COMBI+INFL (p=0.005). Conclusions: Intensified use of the FIN-RACo combination strategy in patients with early active RA induced strict remission by ACR criteria in 62% and by DAS28criteria in 82% of the patients. Radiological changes were rare during the study. Adding INFL during the first 6 months reflected in higher frequency of remissions and prevention of radiological progression during 2 years."

After the publication of an unfavourable trial, however, the drug was restricted to patients with ulcerative colitis. In the late 1970s sulphasalazine was re-examined in rheumatoid arthritis and favourable results reported in ""open"" trials. A double blind controlled trial was therefore conducted comparing enteric coated sulphasalazine and D-penicillamine in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. A total of 63 patients were recruited in two centres; 31 were treated with sulphasalazine and 32 received penicillamine. After 16 weeks' treatment both drugs had produced significant improvements in clinical score, pain score measured on a visual analogue scale, grip strength, Ritchie articular index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum C reactive protein concentration. Nausea was the major side effect in the sulphasalazine treated group. No potentially dangerous effects of sulphasalazine were encountered in contrast with those seen in the penicillamine group. The results suggest that sulphasalazine is an effective and safe drug capable of producing remissions in active rheumatoid arthritis. They also lend confidence to the use of preliminary ""open"" trials as a means of screening for remission inducing drugs in rheumatoid arthritis."

However, it is unknown whether different early aggressive interventions can induce stable remission or a low-active disease state that can be maintained with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD) therapy, and whether they differ in efficacy and safety. The Nordic Rheumatic Diseases Strategy Trials And Registries (NORD-STAR) study will assess and compare (1) the proportion of patients who achieve remission in a head-to-head comparison between csDMARD plus glucocorticoid therapy and three different biological DMARD (bDMARD) therapies with different modes of action and (2) two de-escalation strategies in patients who respond to first-line therapy.
METHODS/DESIGN: in a pragmatic, 80-160-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded, phase 4 study, 800 patients with early RA (symptom duration less than 24¬¨‚Ä†months) are randomized 1: 1: 1: 1 to one of four different treatment arms: (1) aggressive csDMARD therapy with methotrexate‚Äö√Ñ√¢+‚Äö√Ñ√¢sulphasalazine‚Äö√Ñ√¢+‚Äö√Ñ√¢hydroxychloroquine‚Äö√Ñ√¢+‚Äö√Ñ√¢i.a. glucocorticoids (arm 1A) or methotrexate‚Äö√Ñ√¢+‚Äö√Ñ√¢prednisolone p.o.

The primary clinical endpoint is the proportion of patients reaching Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission at week 24. Patients in stable remission over 24 consecutive weeks enter part 2 of the study earliest after 48¬¨‚Ä†weeks. Patients not achieving sustained CDAI remission over 24 consecutive weeks, exit the study after 80¬¨‚Ä†weeks. In part 2, patients are re-randomized to two different de-escalation strategies, either immediate or delayed (after 24¬¨‚Ä†weeks) tapering, followed by cessation of study medication. All patients remain on stable doses of methotrexate. The primary clinical endpoint in part 2 is the proportion of patients in remission (CDAI ‚Äö√¢¬ß2.8) 24¬¨‚Ä†weeks after initiating treatment de-escalation.

In the NORD-STAR trial (1), the aim is to compare the efficacy of different initial treatment regimes in early RA and the effects of subsequent dose reduction and termination of all therapies except methotrexate (MTX). Method(s): This 80-160 week, randomized, multicentre, open-label, assessor-blinded, phase 4 study includes 800 patients with early RA (symptoms < 24 months). Patients are randomized to one of four different treatment arms with stratification for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) status and gender: aggressive conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD) therapy with MTX +/- glucocorticoids (oral or intra-articular), MTX + certolizumab-pegol, MTX + abatacept, or MTX + tocilizumab. The primary clinical endpoint is the proportion of patients reaching Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission at week 24.

The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib was demonstrated as induction and maintenance therapy in 3 Phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled studies (OCTAVE Induction 1, NCT01465763; OCTAVE Induction 2, NCT01458951; OCTAVE Sustain, NCT01458574) in patients (pts) with moderate to severe UC. Methods We present interim safety and efficacy data up to 3 years of treatment (as of 8 July 2016) from an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, long-term extension study (OLE; NCT01470612) in pts who had completed or demonstrated treatment failure in OCTAVE Sustain, or who were non-res-ponders after completing OCTAVE Induction 1 or 2. Pts in remission at Week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain received tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID); all others received 10 mg BID. At Month 2, all pts underwent endoscopy, and non-responders from Induction were mandated to withdraw if no evidence of clinical response was shown. Remission was defined by a Mayo score <2 with no individual subscore >1, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Binary efficacy endpoints were derived from Mayo score, based on local-read endoscopic subscore. Results 914 pts (5 mg BID, n = 156 [17.1%]; 10 mg BID, n = 758 [82.9%]) received >1 dose of study drug; 381 pts (41.7%) discontinued. The most frequent AE leading to dis-continuation was worsening of UC. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs by system organ class (both doses) were 'infections/infestations' and 'gastrointestinal disorders', and by preferred term were 'nasopharyngitis' and 'worsening of UC Serious infections AEs were reported in 4 (2.6%) and 14 (1.8%) pts with 5 and 10 mg BID, respectively. Malignancies excl. NMSC were reported in 9 (1.2%) pts in the 10 mg BID group (no clustering of malignancy type); none were reported in the 5 mg BID group. No new safety risks were identified. Data 'as observed' for remission and mucosal healing at Months 2, 12 and 24 are shown.

Previous reports suggest these effects may have an impact on clinical decision-making based on CRP, e.g. DAS28 (1). We aimed to investigate for the first time the possible association between 7 SNPs in the CRP and the serum level of CRP/ DAS28 in a cohort of 180 untreated inflammatory active early RA patients Methods: 180 DMARD naive RA patients with disease duration >6 months were included in a randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial (OPERA-study,NCT00660647) of methotrexate, intraarticular glucucorticoids + either adalimumab or placebo. SNPs were analyzed by the TaqMan OpenArray system. The 7 SNPs (Table 2) were selected based on previously reported effects on CRP levels(1). CRP was measured using CRP QUICK-READ (range 8-160 mg/l). The associations between SNPs (and haplotypes of SNPs) and CRP and DAS28 levels were evaluated using linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex and treatment. For the analysis of genotypic and haplotypic effects, the common allele homozygous genotype/haplotype was selected as reference, and the effects are presented as percentage. 'Haplo.stats' package for R was used Results: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups, Table 1. There were no significant genotypic or haplotypic effects of the 7 SNPs on CRP levels at baseline or one year (P>0.080). Homozygosity for the minor allele of rs2808632 reduced borderline significant the baseline DAS28 levels to 54% P=0.055, and heterozygosity for rs1800947 increased DAS28 levels at one year to 158% P=0.03. Six haplotypes were constructed encompassing 94% of the cohort, Table 3. The H4 haplotype reduced baseline DAS28 score to 51% P=0.009, and the H6 haplotype increased the DAS28 score at one year to 168% P=0.02. No further haplotypic effect on DAS28 were observed at baseline or one year. (Table Presented) Conclusion: Seven selected CRP gene SNPs had no impact on preand one year post-treatment levels of CRP. Minor genotypic and haplotypic effects on DAS28 scores were observed, but these were not consistent between baseline and one year. This study shows that DAS28 can be used for clinical decision-making without adjustment for CRP gene variants."

Methods: We included 180 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-naive patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) randomized to adalimumab (ADA; n = 89) or placebo (n = 91) in combination with MTX. Plasma samples before and 3 months after treatment initiation were analyzed for 91 specific miRNA by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on microfluidic dynamic arrays. A linear mixed-effects model was used to test for associations between pretreatment miRNA and changes in miRNA expression and American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Boolean (28 joints) remission at 3 and 12 months, applying false discovery rate correction for multiple testing. Using leave-one-out cross validation, we built predictive multivariate miRNA models and estimated classification performances using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results: In the ADA group, a higher pretreatment level of miR-27a-3p was significantly associated with remission at 12 months. The level decreased in remitting patients between pretreatment and 3 months, and increased in nonremitting patients. No associations were found in the placebo group receiving only MTX. Two multivariate miRNA models were able to predict response to ADA treatment after 3 and 12 months, with 63% and 82% area under the ROC curves, respectively. Conclusion: We identified miR-27a-3p as a potential predictive biomarker of ACR/EULAR remission in patients with early RA treated with ADA in combination with MTX. We conclude that pretreatment plasma-miRNA profiles may be of predictive value, but the results need confirmation in independent cohorts. Copyright ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2018. All rights reserved."

We conducted a pilot feasibility randomised controlled clinical trial to test whether intensive periodontal therapy reduces RA disease activity in patients with active RA and periodontitis. METHODS: The following inclusion criteria were applied: patients with RA and periodontitis, aged 18+, stable on treatment with DMARDs for ‚â•‚Äâ3 months, disease activity score (DAS28) ‚â•3.2, and DAS28 >5.1 only if patient unwilling to take biologics. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were randomised to immediate intensive periodontal therapy or to delayed therapy (control group) administered by a dental hygienist in a secondary care setting. Data were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Participants randomised to the control group (delayed therapy) received the standard of care for the duration of the trial, including oral hygiene instructions delivered by a dental hygienist, and the same periodontal therapy as the intervention group after study completion (i.e., 6 months after randomisation). The periodontal inflammation surface area (PISA) was calculated using clinical attachment loss, periodontal probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing. Cumulative probing depth was also measured. We examined the effect of periodontal therapy on periodontal outcomes and on clinical markers of disease activity in RA, as measured by the DAS28-CRP score and musculoskeletal ultrasound grey scale and power Doppler scores. RESULTS: A total of 649 patients with RA were invited to participate in the study. Of these, 296 (46%) RA patients consented to participate in the screening visit. A sample of 201 were assessed for eligibility, of whom 41 (20%) did not meet RA inclusion criteria and 100 (50%) did not meet periodontal disease (PD) criteria. Amongst 60 (30%) eligible participants, 30 were randomised to immediate periodontal therapy and 30 were allocated to the control group. The loss to follow-up was 18% at the end of the trial. There were no major differences with regards to baseline characteristics between groups. Periodontal therapy was associated with reduced periodontal inflamed surface area, cumulative probing depths, RA disease activity scores and ultrasound scores over the course of the trial. There was no change in clinical attachment loss. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the trial was feasible and acceptable to study participants. Recruitment and satisfactory retention into a randomised controlled trial on the effect of periodontal treatment on RA patients is possible, albeit challenging. In this feasibility study of patients with RA and periodontitis, periodontal treatment resulted in significant improvements in periodontal disease outcomes and overall RA disease activity, although complete resolution of periodontal inflammation was difficult to achieve in some cases.

To evaluate whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis who did not respond sufficiently to tocilizumab (TCZ) plus disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment by Week 8 responded at later timepoints when continuing to take their original dose of TCZ. Methods. In this posthoc analysis of data from phase III randomized controlled trials of inadequate responders (IR) to DMARD or tumor necrosis factor-a inhibitors (anti-TNF), percentages of patients meeting early response criteria were calculated by randomized treatment arm (TCZ 4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, or placebo in combination with DMARD). Percentages of patients achieving certain disease activity thresholds at later timepoints were calculated for patients who had/had not achieved response by Week 8. Results. In DMARD-IR early nonresponders, 29.0%, 17.2%, and 3.7% of TCZ 8 mg/kg-randomized, TCZ 4 mg/kg-randomized, and placebo-randomized patients, respectively, achieved 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) < 3.2 by Week 24. Among anti-TNF-IR patients without early response, 26.5%, 8.5%, and 1.9% of TCZ 8 mg/kg-randomized, TCZ 4 mg/kg-randomized, and placebo-randomized patients, respectively, achieved DAS28 < 3.2 at Week 24. Conclusion. A substantial number of DMARD-IR patients taking TCZ 4 or 8 mg/kg and anti-TNF-IR patients taking TCZ 8 mg/kg who failed to respond by 8 weeks benefited from continued TCZ treatment in combination with DMARD.

METHODS: This post hoc analysis pooled data from RA phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing TOF 5 or 10 mg BID, adalimumab (ADA), or placebo, with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and a phase IIIb/IV RCT assessing TOF 5 mg BID monotherapy, TOF 5 mg BID with methotrexate (MTX), or ADA with MTX. Outcomes included proportions of patients achieving ACR20/50/70 responses and ‚â• 20/50/70% improvement rates in ACR components at week 2 and months 1, 3, and 6; and mean percent improvement in ACR components and Clinical or Simplified Disease Activity Index (CDAI or SDAI) low disease activity or remission rates, at month 3, for ACR20/50/70 responders.
RESULTS: Across treatment groups, ‚â• 20/50/70% improvement rates were numerically higher for most physician- vs patient-reported measures. In phase III RCTs, at earlier timepoints, ‚â• 50/70% improvements in patient global assessment of disease activity, pain, and physician global assessment were similar.

Methods: This post hoc analysis pooled data from three Phase 3 studies of tofacitinib (ORAL Scan; ORAL Standard; ORAL Sync) in RA patients. Patients received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily, placebo, or adalimumab (active control; ORAL Standard only, not powered for superiority) with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Assessed through Month (M)12 were changes from baseline in disease activity, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Medical Outcomes Study Sleep scale (MOS-SS), and Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) composite/domain scores, and proportions of patients reporting improvements from baseline in FACIT-F total and SF-36 domain scores ‚â• minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) or ‚â• population normative values. Pearson correlations examined associations among PROs at M6. Treatment comparisons were exploratory, with p < 0.05 considered nominally significant. Results: Generally, active treatment led to significant improvements from baseline in FACIT-F total, and MOS-SS and SF-36 composite/domain scores vs placebo, observed by M1 and maintained through M6 (last placebo-controlled time point).

A mixed-effects model with repeated measures was used to evaluate treatment effect at each visit. Efficacy analyses were exploratory, with no multiplicity adjustments. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: of the 199 pts in this analysis (continuous, n=100; interrupted, n=99), 117 received concomitant MTX. At study baseline (BL) in the continuous and interrupted grps, respectively: 81.8/83.8% of total pts were white, 84.8/86.9% were female, and mean age was 55.0/53.9 years. CRP, HAQ-DI, and DAS28-4(ESR) BL values were generally similar between groups. At Day 8, mean CRP and DAS28-4(ESR) significantly increased from BL for pts receiving interrupted vs continuous tx; HAQ-DI values were similar between grps (Figure). At Day 15, mean CRP, HAQ-DI, and DAS28-4(ESR) significantly increased from BL for pts receiving interrupted vs continuous tx. After tofacitinib reinitiation for 28 days (Day 43), CFB in CRP, HAQ-DI, and DAS28-4(ESR) were similar between grps and approached BL levels. Adverse events (AEs) were experienced by 35.4% and 49.5% of pts receiving interrupted and continuous tx, respectively. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs were bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infection (each AE: 6 pts) and vaccination-related immunisation reaction, myalgia, and rash (each AE: 5 pts). Serious AEs occurred in 3 pts (3%) in each grp. In total, 1 pt (1%) in the interrupted grp discontinued due to study drug-related AEs; no pts discontinued due to disease flare. Conclusion: efficacy of tofacitinib 10 mg BID can be re-established following a temporary (2 weeks) tx discontinuation in pts with RA. Pts receiving continuous tx maintained efficacy throughout the study. Further investigations are required"

Tofacitinib doses could be switched during the study at investigator discretion. In this post hoc analysis, data from ORAL Sequel were stratified into four groups: 5 -> 10 mg BID (Dose-up); 5 mg BID (Stay-on 5); 10 -> 5 mg BID (Dose-down); and 10 mg BID (Stay-on 10).

Safety was assessed for the study duration., RESULTS: Generally, DAS28 improvements and minimum clinically important difference rates were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in Dose-up versus Stay-on 5 up to month 12. DAS28 remission rates were significantly greater in Dose-up versus Stay-on 5 at month 12. Change from baseline in DAS28 was similar in Dose-down and Stay-on 10. No significant differences in DAS28 LDA rates were observed between groups. Safety data were similar overall across the four groups., CONCLUSION: In patients with RA receiving open-label tofacitinib, this analysis found that some benefited from increasing dose from 5 to 10 mg BID and did not find that reducing dose from 10 to 5 mg BID affected efficacy or that dose switching in either direction affected safety., STUDY REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00413699.

Methods: this was a post hoc analysis of two 24-month, phase III randomized controlled trials in methotrexate (MTX)-na‚àö√òve (ORAL Start [NCT01039688]) or MTX-inadequate responder (IR) patients (ORAL Scan [NCT00847613]) receiving tofacitinib 5 or 10¬¨‚Ä†mg twice daily as either monotherapy or with background MTX. The modified total Sharp score (mTSS) and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) were analyzed at month 24 according to disease activity at month 6 defined by the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) or the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, C-reactive protein (DAS28CRP). Results: mean changes from baseline in mTSS at month 24 were less in patients with CDAI remission at month 6 than in those with CDAI moderate/high disease activity (MDA/HDA) at month 6. A DAS28CRP of < 1.9 most closely approximated CDAI remission (‚Äö√¢¬ß 2.8). Tofacitinib appeared to inhibit joint damage in the presence of persistent inflammation compared with MTX. More patients receiving tofacitinib or MTX with CDAI remission or low disease activity (LDA) at month 6 reported normative HAQ-DI scores (< 0.5) at month 24 than did those with CDAI MDA/HDA. Conclusion: regardless of treatment, in both MTX-na‚àö√òve and MTX-IR patients, remission or LDA at month 6 was associated with successful long-term outcomes: inhibition of structural progression and normative HAQ-DI scores. Long-term outcomes were similar when patients achieved CDAI remission or a DAS28CRP of < 1.9, confirming that this is an appropriate cut-off for remission with DAS28CRP. Tofacitinib potentially inhibits joint damage even with persistent inflammation. Funding: pfizer Inc. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: nCT01039688 and NCT00847613"

The treatment target for RA is remission or low disease activity (LDA). Routine assessment of patient index data 3 (RAPID3) consists of 3 patient-reported ACR RA core data set measures: function, pain, and patient global estimate of status. Here, we use RAPID3 to evaluate disease activity in RA patients treated with tofacitinib in 6 Phase 3 (P3) studies. Methods: data were analyzed from 6 P3 studies in which MTX-naive patients or patients with inadequate response (IR) to MTX, biologic/conventional synthetic DMARDs, or TNF inhibitors (TNFi) received tofacitinib as monotherapy, or with MTX or other csDMARDs. ORAL Standard also included an adalimumab arm. All patients were required to meet the ACR classification criteria for the diagnosis of RA. To calculate RAPID3 scores, each of the 3 individual measures (HAQ-DI, pain visual analog scale , and patient global assessment VAS) was scored from 0-10 (HAQ-DI was scored from 0-3 x 3.33) for a total of 30, and divided by 3 to give an adjusted 0-10 score. Remission was defined as RAPID3 <1 and LDA was defined as RAPID3 <2. RAPID3 scores were calculated at the time of the primary endpoint of the index study (either 3 or 6 months) and at the end of each study (either 6, 12, or 24 months). Non-responder imputation was used for all comparisons between treatment and control groups. This analysis was post-hoc. No multiple comparison adjustment was done. Results: of the 4,218 patients included in the P3 studies, 3,162 (75.0%) patients were treated with tofacitinib. Across studies, baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar with the exception of shorter and longer disease duration in ORAL Start and ORAL Step, respectively. Mean RAPID3 score (0-10) at baseline ranged from 5.1 to 6.1 and the proportion of patients with RAPID3 LDA at baseline ranged from 2.8% to 6.3%. At the time of the primary endpoint, significantly (p<0.05) higher rates of RAPID3 remission and LDA were observed with tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily (BID) vs the control groups (placebo/MTX) in ORAL Standard, Start and Solo. Adalimumab was not significant vs placebo in ORAL Standard. In ORAL Scan (MTX-IR), ORAL Step (TNFi-IR) and ORAL Sync (DMARD-IR), higher rates of RAPID3 remission and LDA were observed vs placebo, respectively, however these were not consistently significant. At the end of each P3 study, the rates of RAPID3 remission and LDA were sustained or slightly increased vs at the time of the primary endpoint. Higher rates were seen in patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID vs 5 mg BID (Table). Conclusion: this analysis of the tofacitinib P3 studies demonstrated that patients receiving tofacitinib had improvements in the 3 patient-reported ACR RA core data set measures, and can achieve RAPID3-defined remission and LDA.

9258656,,10.3899/jrheum.140238,"OBJECTIVE: Our 24-week study (NCT01197755; OSKIRA-3) compared the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib versus placebo in patients taking background methotrexate treatment with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response to a single tumor necrosis factor-Œ± antagonist.
METHODS: Adult patients were randomized (1:1:1) to fostamatinib [100 mg bid for 24 weeks (n=105; Group A)], or 100 mg bid for 4 weeks, then 150 mg qd (n=108; Group B), or to placebo (n=110; Group C) for 24 weeks. Nonresponders at Week 12 could enter a longterm extension study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response at Week 24.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced. Significantly more patients in fostamatinib Group A (36.2%; p=0.004), but not B (27.8%; p=0.168), achieved ACR20 at Week 24 versus placebo (21.1%). Frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea, hypertension, and headache. Elevated blood pressure (‚â•140/90 mm Hg) at ‚â•1 visit was observed in 46.7%, 51.9%, and 26.6% of patients, respectively. There were 2 deaths in the study, 1 in Group B and 1 in the placebo group.
CONCLUSION: Fostamatinib 100 mg bid, but not fostamatinib 100 mg bid for 4 weeks then 150 mg qd, achieved statistical improvements in ACR20 at 24 weeks versus placebo. Because of efficacy and safety results from the phase III clinical program, the companies developing fostamatinib have decided not to study it further in RA at this time."
9261387,,10.3899/jrheum.140238,"Background/Purpose: Fostamatinib (Fosta) is an oral SYK inhibitor. This 24-wk study (NCT01197755) compared Fosta vs placebo (PBO) on methotrexate (MTX) treatment in patients (pts) with active RA and an inadequate response to a single TNF-alpha antagonist. Methods: Adult pts on MTX were randomized (1:1:1) to Fosta (100 mg bid for 24 wks [n = 105; Group (Gp) A] or 100 mg bid for 4 wks then 150 mg qd [n = 108; Gp B]) or to PBO (n = 109; Gp C) for 24 wks. Non-responders at Wk 12 could leave the study and enter an active extension study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of pts achieving ACR20 response at Wk 24. Secondary endpoints evaluated efficacy, safety and tolerability up to 24 wks. Results: Baseline characteristics were well balanced across gps. Fosta Gp A, but not Gp B had significantly more pts achieving ACR20 at Wk 24 vs PBO (Table, p=0.004; p=0.168 respectively). At Wk 24, 36.2% of pts in Gp A, 27.8% of pts in Gp B, and 21.1% of pts on PBO achieved ACR20 (Table). Improvement was seen as early as Wk 1 (Table). Secondary endpoints were not tested statistically for Gp B due to failure of the primary endpoint. Fosta Gp A did not show a difference in radiographic outcomes at Wk 24 vs PBO. Frequently reported adverse events (AEs) in Gps A, B and PBO were diarrhea (20.0%, 26.9%, 6.4%), hypertension (13.3%, 13.9%, 8.3%) and headache (7.6%, 8.3%, 10.1%). Serious AEs occurred in 6.7%, 6.5% and 5.5% of pts. AEs leading to discontinuation (DAE) occurred in 9.5%, 10.2% and 8.3% of pts, the most frequent being diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Elevated BP (> 140/90 mmHg) was observed in 46.7%, 51.9%, and 26.6% of pts at > 1 visit. the study (10, 15, and 5 in Gps A, B and C, respectively). In pts on baseline antihypertensives, 50/135 pts had an increase in baseline medication and/or a new therapy (21, 18, and 11 in Gps A, B and C, respectively). Three pts (2 Gp A; and 1 in Gp B) had a DAE due to hypertension. There were 3 adjudicated CV events in Fosta Gp B (cardiopulmonary arrest with fatal myocardial infarction [2.4/100 PY]; heart failure; syncope). One event in PBO was adjudicated as indeterminate (2.7/100 PY; sudden death, unknown etiology). These were the only two deaths in the trial. There was 1 malignancy (2.4/100 PY; renal cell carcinoma) in Fosta Gp B. Conclusion: In this phase III study in pts with an inadequate response to a single TNF-alpha antagonist, Fosta 100 mg bid but not Fosta 100 mg bid for 4 wks then 150 mg qd achieved statistical improvements in ACR20 response rate at 24 wks vs PBO. The overall level of response was not as large as had been anticipated based on evaluation of Phase 2 results (eg the TASKi program). Safety and tolerability findings were consistent with the profile observed in earlier Fosta studies. (Table Presented)."

Therefore, using the data from the POET study, we evaluated the available potential clinical predictors of prolonged disease control after discontinuation of TNFi. Methods: data of 439 RA patients who were randomized to stop TNFi treatment in the POET study were analyzed post-hoc. The indicator of prolonged acceptable disease control over 12 months was: not restarting TNFi treatment. Available potential clinical predictors were: type of TNFi (antibody vs. receptor antagonist); concomitant conventional systemic DMARD; female sex; Younger age (<60 yrs.); short disease duration (<10 yrs.); RF positive; ACPA positive; erosive disease; normal weight (BMI 18.5 - 25); first TNFi; DAS28 deep remission (DAS28 <1.98) and MBDAscore <44, all at baseline. Associations between potential clinical predictors and disease relapse versus prolonged acceptable disease control were examined using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Results: in the POET study 439 stable controlled RA-patients in remission or low-disease activity stopped their TNFi. During the following 12 months observation 50,1% of patients remained in low disease activity or remission. Univariate analysis revealed an association of the following predictors: type of TNFi (antibody vs. receptor antagonist) OR: 2.26(1.53-3.34) p<0.0001; Short disease duration OR: 1.88(1.26-2.79) p=0.002; absences of erosions OR: 1.62(1.08-2.44) p=0.020 and MBDA score <44 OR: 2.32(1.32-4.05) p=0.003. Multivariate (backward deletion) of potential clinical predictors of prolonged acceptable disease control after TNFi discontinuation are: type of TNFi (antibody vs. receptor antagonist) OR: 2.39(1.57 - 3.65) p<0.0001; Short disease duration (<10 yrs.) OR 2.02 (1.34 - 3.05) p=0.001; and MBDA <44 OR: 2.01 (1.11 - 3.65) p= 0.022. Conclusion: this post hoc analysis in well-controlled RA patients stopping their TNFi during participations in the POET study suggests that patients characterized by the use of an TNFi antibody (predominatly adalumimab but including infliximab, golumimab and certoluzimab) with a short disease duration and a low MBDA score are likely to remain well-controlled (remission or low disease activity) during the following 12 months. Their littermates using a receptor antagonist (etanercept) with a longstanding disease and a high MBDA are most likely to flare. These data allow the well-controlled RA-patient using a TNFi and their attending physician to make an educated shared decision on continuation or stopping this expensive treatment"

Methods: post-hoc analysis of 439 RA patients (67.3% rheumatoid factor positive) with longstanding RA in remission or with stable low disease activity, randomized to stopping TNFi treatment in the multicenter POET trial. Prolonged acceptable disease control was defined as not restarting TNFi treatment within 12 months after stopping. Baseline demographic and disease-related variables were included in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis for identifying predictors of relapse. Results: one year after baseline, 220 patients (50.1%) had not restarted TNFi treatment. Use of an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody (versus a receptor antagonist, OR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.58-3.67), ‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬¢‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚Äö√†√ª¬¨¬®¬¨√ü10 yrs. disease duration (OR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.42-3.26) and low or moderate multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) scores (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.10-3.64) at baseline were independently predictive of successful TNFi discontinuation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.61-0.71). Results were similar when using no physician-reported flare as the criterion. TNFi-free survival was significantly different for patient groups based on the number of predictors present, ranging from 21.4% of patients with no predictor present to 66.7% of patients with all three predictors present. Conclusion: patients using an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, with shorter disease duration and low or moderate baseline MBDA score are most likely to achieve prolonged disease control after TNFi discontinuation"

We evaluated the multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score as a predictor of disease relapse after discontinuation of TNF inhibitor (TNFi) treatment. Methods 439 RA patients who were randomized to stop TNFi treatment in the POET study were analyzed post-hoc. Three indicators of disease relapse were assessed over 12 months: 1) restarting TNFi treatment, 2) escalation of any DMARD therapy and 3) physician-reported flare. MBDA score was assessed at baseline. Associations between MBDA score and disease relapse were examined using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Results At baseline, 50.1%, 35.3% and 14.6% of patients had low (<30), moderate (30-44) or high (>44) MBDA scores. Within 12 months, 49.9% of patients had restarted TNFi medication, 59.0% had escalation of any DMARD and 57.2% had 1 physician-reported flare. MBDA score was associated with each indicator of relapse. At least one indicator of relapse was observed in 59.5%, 68.4% and 81.3% of patients with low, moderate or high MBDA scores, respectively (P = 0.004). Adjusted for baseline DAS28-ESR, disease duration, BMI and erosions, high MBDA scores were associated with increased risk for restarting TNFi treatment (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.00-3.40), DMARD escalation (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.01-3.94) and physician-reported flare (OR = 2.00, 95% 1.06-3.77). Conclusion For RA patients with stable LDA who stopped TNFi, a high baseline MBDA score was independently predictive of disease relapse within 12 months. The MBDA score may be useful for identifying patients at risk of relapse after TNFi discontinuation. Copyright ¬¨¬© 2018 Ghiti Moghadam et al.

To optimise cost-effectiveness, tapering or interruption of TNFi therapy in established RA patients is advocated. We explored whether cessation of TNFi results in impaired vasodilator function and whether this relates to the development of a Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-based flare. Forty-one patients were assessed for eligibility as RA with at least 12¬¨‚Ä†months of low disease activity (based on 28 joint counts); 35 enrolled into the randomised study: 8 were randomised to continue, 27 to stopping TNFi. Forearm vasodilation to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was assessed before cessation of TNFi therapy (visit 1) and 6¬¨‚Ä†months after (dis)continuation of TNFi or at flare (based on DAS28) whichever came first (visit 2). None of the patients who continued their TNFi therapy flared. Eight out of 22 patients who stopped TNFi therapy flared. The vasodilator response to ACh and SNP was reduced significantly in patients who experienced a flare of RA: in patients who did not experience a flare, the vasodilator response to ACh or SNP was not significantly affected. Vasodilator function is reduced after cessation of TNFi, but only when RA reactivates, indicating that early vasodilator dysfunction is a consequence rather than a cause of systemic inflammation in RA and not specifically related to inhibition of TNF≈í¬± signalling. Without close monitoring, microvascular damage can occur after TNFi interruption with potential devastating implications for cardiovascular health.

However, not all patients maintain remission or low disease activity after tapering or discontinuation of bDMARDs. The aim of the ImPact of Residual Inflammation Detected via Imaging TEchniques, Drug Levels and Patient Characteristics on the Outcome of Dose TaperIng of Adalimumab in Clinical Remission Rheumatoid ArThritis (RA) study, or PREDICTRA, is to generate data on patient and disease characteristics that may predict the clinical course of a fixed dose-tapering regimen with the bDMARD adalimumab., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PREDICTRA is an ongoing, multicentre, phase IV, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study of adalimumab dose tapering controlled by withdrawal in participants with RA who achieved stable clinical remission while receiving adalimumab. The study includes a screening period, a 4-week lead-in period with open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week and a subsequent 36-week double-blind period during which participants are randomised 5:1 to adalimumab 40 mg every 3 weeks (taper arm) or placebo (withdrawal arm). The primary explanatory efficacy variables are lead-in baseline hand and wrist MRI-detected synovitis and bone marrow oedema scores, as well as a composite of both scores; the dependent variable is the occurrence of flare up to week 40. Additional efficacy variables, safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and immunogenicity will also be assessed, and an ultrasound substudy will be conducted., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, local laws and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

First-line therapy with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARD) is insufficiently effective in 40% of cases and these patients are treated with biotherapies. The increased use of these drugs each year is becoming a public health issue with considerable economic burden. This cost is 20 times higher than that of sDMARD. However, among patients treated with biotherapies, clinical practice shows that about one third will not respond to the selected drug. In nonresponse cases, practitioners currently have no choice but to perform an empirical switching between different treatments, because no tool capable of predicting the response or nonresponse to these molecules is currently available., METHODS: The study is a prospective, phase III, controlled, multicenter, and randomized, single-blind (patient) clinical trial, including RA patients with a previous failure to anti-TNF therapies. The main objective is the analysis of the clinical and pharmacoeconomic impact after 6 months of treatment. Intervention arm: prescription of biotherapy (rituximab, adalimumab, abatacept) using SinnoTest R software, a prediction software based on proteomic biomarkers. Control arm: prescription of biotherapy based on current practice, without the SinnoTest R software (any biotherapy). In addition, a substudy will be carried out within this trial to generate a biobank and further analyze the proteomic profile of the patients and their modification throughout the study., DISCUSSION: This clinical trial study will be the first validation study of a biotherapy response prediction software, bringing personalized medicine into the management of RA. We expect that the findings from this study will bring several benefits for the patient and the Health Care System., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClincalTrials.gov NCT04147026 .

METHODS: patients with early RA who received adalimumab plus MTX (n = 240), adalimumab (n = 222), or MTX (n = 216) were grouped by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response, 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28), or remission-like state [tender joint count (TJC) = 0; DAS28 < 2.6; swollen joint count = 0; ACR100] at 26 and 104 weeks. Radiographic progression was assessed by cumulative probability plots, mean changes in total Sharp score (DeltaTSS), and percentages of progressors (DeltaTSS > 0.5).
RESULTS: across the spectrum of clinical outcomes, including ACR20 nonresponses and remission-like responses, therapy with adalimumab plus MTX permitted less radiographic progression at Weeks 26 and 104 than MTX monotherapy. Adalimumab monotherapy was generally intermediate. A strong, proportional relationship was observed between clinical response and radiographic efficacy only for MTX monotherapy. The monotherapies approximated the radiographic efficacy of adalimumab plus MTX only among remission-like responders, although progression was significantly greater with MTX monotherapy versus adalimumab plus MTX for patients with TJC = 0.

9260929,,10.3899/jrheum.130543,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the longterm safety of adalimumab administered with or without methotrexate (MTX) and compare the efficacy of combination therapy initialization to adalimumab or MTX monotherapy initialization during the open-label extension (OLE) of the PREMIER trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT00195663).
METHODS: Patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomized to receive blinded adalimumab + MTX, adalimumab alone, or MTX alone for 2 years. Following the double-blinded period, patients enrolling in the OLE were given adalimumab for up to 8 additional years, beginning as monotherapy; investigators could add MTX at their discretion. Results for clinical, functional, and radiographic progression were collected for up to 10 years of treatment.
RESULTS: During the PREMIER OLE, 250/497 patients (50.3%) completed the trial without new safety signals arising. Similar proportions of patients discontinued the trial early, although lack of efficacy was reported less often for patients initially randomized to the adalimumab + MTX arm (9.3%; 21.2%, and 23.7% for adalimumab and MTX monotherapies, respectively). Clinical and functional disease control was maintained throughout the trial. Patients initially randomized to adalimumab + MTX displayed better outcomes, particularly in prevention of radiographic progression (modified total Sharp score change = 4.0, 8.8, 11.0 at Year 10 for the initial adalimumab + MTX, adalimumab, and MTX arms, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Intensive therapy with adalimumab + MTX combination in patients with early RA has longterm benefits compared to patients initiating with 2-year adalimumab or MTX monotherapy that persists up to 10 years following adalimumab OLE. No new safety findings were observed following longterm adalimumab treatment."
9261102,,10.3899/jrheum.121468,"Objectives: Recent publications advocate treatment adjustment at 12 weeks (wks) for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); still, data support the possibility of later responses to therapy. Our objective was to evaluate the association of early (12 weeks) and delayed (24 weeks) clinical responses with rates of clinical remission, low-disease activity (LDAS), and rapid radiographic progression (RRP) at 52 weeks in patients with early RA treated with MTX monotherapy or adalimumab (ADA) + MTX combination therapy in the PREMIER trial. Methods: PREMIER was a 104-week, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in a MTX-naive population with early RA. In this post hoc analysis, observed data comparing MTX with ADA + MTX therapy are presented. Clinical outcome measures included the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and mean change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score (DmTSS) at 52 weeks. Patients were categorized on the basis of clinical response (DAS28 improvement >1.2 or 20/50/70% improvement in ACR score) at 12 and 24 weeks: ""early responders"" achieved the clinical target at week 12 and maintained the response at week 24; ""delayed responders"" did not meet the clinical target until week 24. The percentages of patients at 52 weeks with LDAS (DAS28 < 3.2), clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6), and RRP (DmTSS >3 units/year) in each group were determined. Results: In both treatment groups, early clinical responses were associated with better long-term outcomes than delayed responses. Achieving early or delayed ACR70 responses did not result in treatment group differences in the proportion of patients achieving LDAS or clinical remission at week 52. However, delayed responses to MTX resulted in a high proportion of patients with RRP. Indeed, delayed ACR70 responses were associated with an RRP prevalence of 40%. In addition, even an early improvement of DAS28 >1.2 with MTX was insufficient to slow radiographic progression (41% RRP). In contrast, early or delayed clinical responses to ADA + MTX resulted in low proportions of RRP at 52 weeks, even for patients with a delayed ACR20 response (11% RRP). Of note, ADA + MTX delayed responders had less RRP than MTX-treated early responders. Conclusions: MTX-treated patients with early RA who fail to achieve an ACR70 within 12 wks of treatment are at risk for RRP and should be considered for treatment adjustment. In contrast, ADA + MTX treatment is associated with better clinical outcomes and less severe radiographic progression at 52 wks, even among patients with a delayed clinical response."
9261151,,10.3899/jrheum.081018,"Background/Purpose: To prevent disease progression, treat-to-target recommendations for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) include the evaluation and adjustment of drug therapy at least every 3 months until a target level of remission or low disease activity is achieved. It is well established that anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment modifies associations between disease activity and radiographic progression over periods of 1-2 years.1 We aimed to assess whether TNF inhibition modifies this association over the initial 3-6 months of treatment for early RA. Methods: Methotrexate (MTX)-naive early RA patients randomized to double-blind treatment with adalimumab (ADA)+MTX combination therapy vs. MTX monotherapy were drawn from the Phase III PREMIER clinical trial. Associations between week 12 disease activity, assessed using DAS28- CRP(4), and changes in modified total sharp score (mTSS) from baseline to week 26 were compared between the ADA+MTX and MTX arms using generalized additive regression. mTSS progression was modeled as an absolute score change and as a worsening of >5 units.2 Models were fit with and without adjustment for baseline mTSS, DAS28, numbers of tender and swollen joints, and RA duration. Results: A total of 219 MTX-treated patients and 241 ADA+MTXtreated patients were included in the investigation. The mean age was 52 years, 73% were female, and the average RA duration was 9 months. In the adjusted analyses, patients treated with ADA+MTX experienced limited mean increases in mTSS from baseline to week 26 that were numerically similar across all levels of week 12 DAS28, whereas patients treated with MTX showed a sharp increase in mTSS progression with increasing week 12 DAS28 (Figure). Compared to patients who were treated with MTX alone, those treated with ADA+MTX achieving a DAS28 <2.6 at week 12 had a significantly smaller change in mTSS (difference: -1.59; 95% CI: -2.74, -0.44) and a significantly lower risk of mTSS progression of >5 units (odds ratio [OR]: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.61) at week 26. Results were similar for unadjusted analyses. (Figure presented) Conclusion: Early RA patients achieving a given disease activity level by week 12 with ADA+MTX experience less radiographic progression by week 26 than those achieving the same disease activity level with MTX alone. This could reflect the slower onset of response to MTX and/or a separate structure-protective effect for anti-TNF treatment. These aspects should be considered when setting disease activity targets with the goal of limiting radiographic progression."
9263316,,10.3899/jrheum.100208,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of initial combination treatment with adalimumab (ADA) and methotrexate (MTX) versus monotherapy with ADA or MTX during an open-label extension of PREMIER.
METHODS: Patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) received blinded ADA plus MTX, ADA alone, or MTX alone for 2 years in PREMIER. At Year 2, patients could enroll in an open-label extension and receive ADA monotherapy; MTX could be added at the investigator's discretion. Longterm efficacy results are presented as observed data.
RESULTS: In the open-label period, 497 of the original 799 randomized patients had ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 1 dose of ADA (by original randomization: ADA plus MTX, n = 183; ADA, n = 159; MTX, n = 155). In the completers cohort [patients with available Year-5 ACR responses and modified total Sharp scores (mTSS)], the Year-5 mean change from baseline in mTSS for the ADA+MTX arm (n = 124) was 2.9, compared with 8.7 and 9.7 in the ADA (n = 115) and MTX (n = 115) arms. Comprehensive disease remission, defined as the combination of DAS28 remission, normal function (Health Assessment Questionnaire ‚Äö√¢¬ß 0.5), and radiographic nonprogression (≈í√ÆmTSS ‚Äö√¢¬ß 0.5), was achieved by more patients in the initial ADA+MTX arm (35%) than in the ADA (13%) or MTX (14%) arms.

9737473,,10.3899/jrheum.081018c2,"Objective: Global physical functioning in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is commonly measured by the overall score on the patient-reported Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). We evaluated patient-relevant aspects of physical functioning during treatment with a combination of adalimumab (ADA) and methotrexate (MTX) vs. MTX alone. Methods: Data were derived from PREMIER, a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, Phase III trial in MTX-naive patients with early RA (< 3 years). On the HAQ, patients rated their ability to perform a variety of tasks on this scale: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. Ordered logistic regression techniques were adopted to estimate the effects of treatment on individual HAQ item responses in a proportional-odds model at baseline, Week 52, and Week 104. A similar model was used to estimate the effect of radiographic damage (using modified total Sharp scores [mTSS]) on individual HAQ item responses. Results: Baseline distributions of HAQ item responses were similar between treatment groups. At Weeks 52 and 104, the ADA+MTX group (N=269) reported better physical functioning than the MTX monotherapy group (N=257) for 15 of 20 HAQ items (odds ratios: 1.77 to 2.78 at Week 52; 1.62 to 2.77 at Week 104; p< 0.05 for each comparison). ADA+MTX-treated patients were approximately 3 times more likely thanMTX-treated patients to find it easier to open car doors and to cut their meat and approximately 2 times more likely to have better ability to do most of the remaining activities assessed by the HAQ. The effect of mTSS on HAQ was significant for 4 items atWeek 52 and for 6 items atWeek 104 (all comparisons p< 0.05). Two items (walking outdoors on flat ground; bathing) were affected by mTSS at both time points (both p< 0.05). Conclusion: Patients with early RA treated with ADA+MTX reported better outcomes than patients treated with MTX alone for most aspects of physical functioning measured by the HAQ. Activities involving the hands had the greatest improvements. Several aspects of physical functioning were affected by radiographic damage, with greater impact over time."

Both SF-6D and HUI-3 were found to be sensitive preference-based measures for assessing the effects of treatment on multidimensional function. No clinically meaningful differences between adalimumab and MTX monotherapy groups were observed for most measures.

9738915,,10.3899/jrheum.121468,"Background: For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there has been increased interest in treating to target early and quickly. While some advocate treatment adjustment at 12 weeks (wks), data support the possibility of later responses to therapy. The longer-term radiographic implications of such a delay in response have not been examined previously. Objective: To evaluate the association of early (12 wks) and delayed (24 wks) clinical responses with rates of clinical remission, low-disease activity (LDAS), and rapid radiographic progression (RRP) at 52 wks in patients with early RA treated with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy or adalimumab (ADA) + MTX combination therapy in the PREMIER trial. Methods: PREMIER was a 104-wk, phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in MTX-naive patients with early RA, who were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment groups: MTX, ADA 40 mg every other wk (eow), or ADA 40 mg eow + MTX. In this post hoc analysis, observed data comparing MTX with ADA + MTX therapy are presented. Clinical outcome measures included the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and mean change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score (DELTAmTSS) at 52 wks. Patients were categorized on the basis of clinical response (DAS28 improvement >=1.2 or 20/50/70% improvement in ACR score) at 12 and 24 wks as responders or non-responders: ""early responders"" achieved the clinical target at wk 12 and maintained the response at wk 24; ""delayed responders"" did not meet the clinical target until wk 24. The percentages of patients at 52 wks with LDAS (DAS28 <3.2), clinical remission (DAS28 <2.6), and RRP (DELTAmTSS >3 units/year) in each group were determined. Results: In both treatment groups, early clinical responses were associated with better long-term outcomes than delayed responses (Table). Achieving early or delayed ACR70 responses did not result in treatment group differences in the proportion of patients achieving LDAS or clinical remission at wk 52. Importantly, delayed responses to MTX resulted in a high proportion of patients with RRP. Indeed, delayed ACR70 responses were associated with an RRP prevalence of 40%. In addition, an early improvement in DAS28 >=1.2 with MTX was insufficient to slow radiographic progression (41% RRP). In contrast, early or delayed clinical responses to ADA + MTX resulted in low proportions of RRP at 52 wks, even for patients with a delayed ACR20 response (11% RRP). Of note, ADA + MTX-treated delayed responders had less RRP than MTX-treated early responders. (Table Presented) Conclusions: MTX-treated patients with early RA who fail to achieve high-level response (e.g. ACR70) within 12 wks are at risk for RRP and should be considered for treatment adjustment. ADA + MTX treatment is associated with better clinical outcomes and less severe radiographic progression at 52 wks, even among patients with a delayed clinical response."

Namilumab (AMG203) is an investigational monoclonal antibody with high affinity for the GM-CSF ligand. The aim of this phase ib study (PRIORA; NCT01317797) was to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of namilumab in patients with active RA. Methods: this was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, dose-escalating study in patients with mild-to-moderate RA (according to ACR 1987 revised criteria) receiving stable MTX doses for >12 weeks prior to randomisation. Patients received 3 single subcutaneous injections of namilumab 150 or 300 mg or matching placebo on days 0, 15 and 29, with 12 weeks' follow-up. Clinical efficacy was an exploratory endpoint and originally measured by DAS44; a pre-defined post hoc efficacy analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of namilumab on signs and symptoms of RA using DAS28, swelling joint counts, tender joint counts, and patient outcome measures. Results: 24 patients were enrolled (71% female, mean age 55.9 years): cohort 1 (n=13; namilumab 150 mg, n=8; placebo, n=5); and cohort 2 (n=11; namilumab 300 mg, n=7, placebo, n=4). Disease activity at baseline was moderate (mean DAS28-ESR: placebo = 4.7; namilumab 150 mg = 4.9; namilumab 300 mg = 4.4). Namilumab was generally well tolerated. A total of 49 treatment-emergent adverse events (teaes) were observed in 14 patients (58%). The most common teaes were nasopharyngitis (n=4; 17%), exacerbation/worsening of RA (n=3; 13%) and musculoskeletal pain (n=2; 8%). The percentage of patients with any TEAE was similar (namilumab 150 mg: 63%; namilumab 300 mg: 57%; placebo: 56%). There was no evidence of immunogenicity. Median time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) after the third dose of namilumab was 5-6 days. Dose-normalised exposure (cmax/d and auctau/d) was similar at both namilumab dose levels. Accumulation was ongoing after the third injection (day 43), AS expected given the observed mean t1/2 of ~3 weeks. The post hoc efficacy analysis included 21 patients (1 patient on namilumab 150 mg and 2 patients on placebo were excluded due to major protocol violations). In general, improvements in DAS28 scores (ESR and CRP) and joint counts were greater with namilumab than placebo AS early AS day 29. Both namilumab groups were associated with greater improvements in DAS28-CRP than placebo from day 27 until the end of the study. Furthermore, the difference in mean DAS28-CRP changes from baseline between namilumab and placebo favoured namilumab at all time points. Conclusion: results of PRIORA show that namilumab was generally well tolerated in active RA and preliminary efficacy was demonstrated; further evaluation is needed due to the small sample size. Two phase II studies have been initiated in patients with moderate-to-severe RA"

Method(s): in the initial 52-week open-label phase, enrolled patients received once-weekly etanercept 50 mg plus methotrexate. Patients who achieved DAS28 <=3.2 at week 39 and <2.6 at week 52 were randomized to etanercept 25 mg plus methotrexate, methotrexate monotherapy, or placebo once weekly for 39 weeks in the double-blind phase. The relationships between responses in the open-label phase and sustained remission (DAS28 <2.6 at weeks 76 and 91, without glucocorticoid rescue therapy from weeks 52 to 64) in the double-blind phase were analyzed. Result(s): in the open-label phase, 70% of patients achieved DAS28 remission at week 52. In the double-blind phase, 63%, 40%, and 23% of patients had sustained DAS28 remission in the reduced-dose combination-therapy, methotrexate-monotherapy, and placebo groups, respectively. In patients receiving reduced-dose combination therapy, sustained remission was more likely in those who achieved DAS28 remission (p = 0.005) or low disease activity (p=0.044) in a shorter time, and who had a lower DAS28 (p = 0.016) or achieved ACR/EULAR Boolean remission (p < 0.05) at the end of the open-label phase. In patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy, sustained remission was associated with a lower acute-phase response (C-reactive protein, p = 0.007; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, p = 0.016) at the end of the open-label phase. Conclusion(s): fast response and suppression of inflammation with etanercept-methotrexate therapy may predict successful etanercept tapering/withdrawal in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.

METHODS: one hundred five patients with active RA of less than 36 months duration, who had never previously been treated with immunosuppressive agents, were included in a 12-month, multi-center, open, randomized trial. Patients who fulfilled the criteria for early severe RA were randomized to receive either combination therapy (CSA + MTX n = 34, CSA + HCQ n = 35) or CSA alone (n = 36)._x000D_
RESULTS: CSA + MTX was more effective than the other two treatment groups in controlling RA symptoms. CSA+MTX did not show a significant radiographic progression according to Larsen-Dale (0.90 +/- 3.89 compared to baseline values, P > 0.05); moreover, patients treated with CSA alone or CSA+HCQ showed a significant worsening of Larsen-Dale score (2.91 +/- 5.99 and 2.97 +/- 4.28 respectively vs baseline values, P < 0.05), although not significant when compared with the CSA + HCQ group (P = 0.56 and 0.39, respectively)._x000D_
CONCLUSIONS: this trial indicated that CSA+MTX was more effective than the other two treatments in improving clinical data and inhibiting radiographic progression, although the differences were not significant in this relatively small study. However, the difference was significant in favor of CSA + MTX regarding ACR 50% response."
9256780,,10.1371/journal.pone.0169830,"Background: pentraxin 3 is proposed to be a marker of inflammation and cardiovascular risk, but its role in inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs) is still uncertain. Therefore, we wanted to examine if anti-rheumatic treatment reduced serum PTX3 (s-PTX3) levels in IRDs, and if s-PTX3 levels were related to other markers of inflammation and to endothelial function (EF). Methods: we examined s-PTX3, EF and established inflammatory biomarkers in 114 IRD patients from the PSARA study before and after 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment with methotrexate (MTX) or anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) therapy with or without MTX comedication. Results: s-PTX3 levels in all IRD diagnoses were above the upper limit of the reference range. In contrast to established inflammatory markers, in particular CRP and ESR, s-PTX3 levels did not change significantly after 6 weeks and 6 months of anti-rheumatic therapy. There was no difference in change in s-PTX3 levels from baseline to 6 weeks and 6 months between MTX monotherapy and anti-TNF regimens. CRP, ESR and EF were not related to changes in s-PTX3 neither in crude nor adjusted analyses. Conclusion: IRD patients have increased s-PTX3 levels, which, in contrast to other inflammatory markers, do not seem to improve within 6 months of therapy with MTX and/or anti-TNF. Thus, s-PTX3 might reflect a persisting immune process, even a causal factor of inflammation, not inhibited by the standard anti-rheumatic treatment. Furthermore, even though s-PTX3 is thought to be a strong predictor of cardiovascular prognosis, it was not related to EF. Copyright ¬© 2017 Deyab et al.

Sulphasalazine was therefore compared with placebo and intramuscular sodium aurothiomalate in 90 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. After six months' treatment both sulphasalazine and sodium aurothiomalate had produced significant clinical and laboratory benefit, whereas placebo had produced no significant change in any variable. Thirteen patients stopped taking the placebo because of lack of effect whereas only two patients stopped taking sulphasalazine and one sodium aurothiomalate for this reason. The major toxicity encountered in the group treated with sulphasalazine was nausea or vomiting, or both; this may be related to slow acetylator phenotype. Sulphasalazine appears to be an effective second line agent, and further pharmacokinetic studies might prove useful in diminishing gastrointestinal side effects."
9256966,,10.3899/jrheum.110169,"OBJECTIVES: the effectiveness of anakinra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unknown. We evaluated the efficacy of anakinra (combined with methotrexate) in a randomised clinical trial of early active RA patients.

METHODS: the Combination Anti-Rheumatic Drugs in Early RA-2 (CARDERA-2) trial was a randomised trial of early (duration <1 year) active RA. Patients were randomised to 12 months of: (1) methotrexate or (2) anakinra-methotrexate. Follow-up lasted 2 years. The primary outcome was erosive progression (changes from baseline in modified Larsen scores). Secondary outcomes were changes from baseline in disease activity score on a 28-joint count (DAS28), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), and quality of life (EQ-5D) scores alongside ACR responder rates.

RESULTS: 154 patients received the allocated intervention (from 259 screened). Similar Larsen score progression was seen at 12 and 24 months in patients receiving anakinra-methotrexate (mean changes from baseline of 2.50 and 5.10, respectively) and methotrexate monotherapy (mean changes from baseline of 4.16 and 5.20, respectively). Lower improvements in DAS28 and HAQ scores were seen at all time-points in anakinra-methotrexate treated patients; these were significantly less at 24 months (DAS28 p=0.04; HAQ P=0.02). Significantly lower EQ-5D score increases were seen at 12 months with anakinra-methotrexate (p=0.03). Anakinra-methotrexate was associated with more serious adverse events compared with methotrexate monotherapy (11 vs. 6 patients), although this was not significant (p=0.59).

CONCLUSIONS: anakinra (combined with methotrexate) is not effective in early, active RA. It provided no clinical benefits beyond methotrexate monotherapy."
11085000,https://njl-admin.nihr.ac.uk/document/download/2040214,10.3310/gopl1729,"BACKGROUND: Although biological therapies have transformed the outlook for those with rheumatoid arthritis, there is a lack of any meaningful response in approximately 40% of patients. The role of B cells in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis is well recognised and is supported by the clinical efficacy of the B-cell-depleting agent rituximab (MabThera, F. Hoffman La-Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland). Rituximab is licensed for use in rheumatoid arthritis following failure of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and tumour necrosis factor inhibitor therapy. However, over 50% of patients show low/absent synovial B-cell infiltration, suggesting that, in these patients, inflammation is driven by alternative cell types. This prompted us to test the hypothesis that, in synovial biopsy B-cell-poor patients, tocilizumab (RoActemra, F. Hoffman La-Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) (targeting interleukin 6) is superior to rituximab (targeting CD20+/B cells)., DESIGN: The R4-RA (A Randomised, open-labelled study in anti-TNFalpha inadequate responders to investigate the mechanisms for Response, Resistance to Rituximab versus Tocilizumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients) trial is a 48-week Phase IV, open-label, randomised controlled trial conducted in 19 European centres that recruited patients failing on or intolerant to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy and at least one tumour necrosis factor inhibitor., PARTICIPANTS: Synovial tissue was obtained at trial entry and classified histologically as B-cell rich or B-cell poor to inform balanced stratification. Patients were randomised on a 1 : 1 basis to receive standard therapy with rituximab or tocilizumab. B-cell-poor/-rich molecular classification was also carried out. The study was powered to test the superiority of tocilizumab over rituximab at 16 weeks in the B-cell-poor population., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was defined as an improvement in the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of >= 50% from baseline. In addition, patients were considered to be non-responders if they did not reach an improvement in CDAI score of >= 50% and a CDAI score of < 10.1, defined for simplicity as CDAI major treatment response (CDAI-MTR). Secondary outcomes included the assessment of CDAI response in the B-cell-rich cohort, in which the non-inferiority of rituximab compared with tocilizumab was evaluated. Safety data up to week 48 are reported., RESULTS: In total, 164 patients were randomised: 83 patients received rituximab and 81 received tocilizumab. Eighty-one out of 83 rituximab patients and 73 out of 81 tocilizumab patients completed treatment up to week 16 (primary end point). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups. In the histologically classified B-cell-poor population (n = 79), no significant difference was observed in the primary outcome, an improvement in CDAI score of >= 50% from baseline (risk ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.96). A supplementary analysis of the CDAI-MTR, however, did reach statistical significance (risk ratio 1.96, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 3.78). In addition, when B-cell-poor classification was determined molecularly, both the primary end point and the CDAI-MTR were statistically significant (risk ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 2.91, and risk ratio 4.12, 95% confidence interval 1.55 to 11.01, respectively). Moreover, a larger number of secondary end points achieved significance when classified molecularly than when classified histologically. In the B-cell-rich population, there was no significant difference between treatments in the majority of both primary and secondary end points. There were more adverse events and serious adverse events, such as infections, in the tocilizumab group than in the rituximab group., CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first biopsy-based, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of rheumatoid arthritis. We were unable to demonstrate that tocilizumab was more effective than rituximab in patients with a B-cell-poor pathotype in our primary analysis. However, superiority was shown in most of the supplementary and secondary analyses using a molecular classification. These analyses overcame possible unavoidable weaknesses in our original study plan, in which the histological method of determining B-cell status may have misclassified some participants and our chosen primary outcome was insufficiently sensitive. Given the significant results observed using the molecular classification, future research will focus on refining this stratification method and evaluating its clinical utility., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN97443826., FUNDING: This project was funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) programme, a Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) partnership.

This analysis aims to describe the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in Chinese RA patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX-IR), and to analyze the effects of baseline characteristics on the efficacy of baricitinib treatment. Methods: In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 231 Chinese patients with moderately to severely active RA who had MTX-IR were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 115) or baricitinib 4 mg once daily (n = 116).

Other efficacy measures included ACR50, ACR70, Physician‚Äôs Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Patient‚Äôs Global Assessment of Disease Activity, patient‚Äôs assessment of pain, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, remission and low disease activity rates according to Simplified Disease Activity Index or Clinical Disease Activity Index, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, and mean duration and severity of morning joint stiffness, worst tiredness and worst joint pain were analyzed. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed across baseline characteristics. Results: Statistically significant improvement in ACR20 response was achieved with baricitinib at week 12 (53.4 vs. 22.6%, p = 0.001) in Chinese patients, compared to placebo. Most of the secondary objectives were met with statistically significant improvements. Efficacy of baricitinib was irrespective of patient demographics and baseline characteristics. Safety events were similar between the baricitinib and placebo groups. Conclusions: The efficacy of baricitinib 4 mg in Chinese patients with moderately to severely active RA and prior MTX-IR was clinically significant compared to placebo regardless of baseline characteristics.

METHODS: data from two Phase 3, randomized placebo-controlled (and active-controlled [RA-BEAM]), clinical studies assessing the safety and efficacy of baricitinib in adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Duration of MJS and Severity of MJS PROs.
RESULTS: test-retest reliability of Duration of MJS and Severity of MJS was supported through large intraclass correlation coefficients among stable patients (coefficient range for both studies: 0.88 to 0.93). In support of construct validity, moderate correlations were evidenced between Duration of MJS and other related patient- and clinician-reported assessments of RA symptoms and patient functioning, whereas moderate-to-strong correlations were evidenced between these same patient- and clinician-reported assessments and Severity of MJS. Statistically significant differences between the median and mean values of Duration of MJS and Severity of MJS for differing categories of RA disease severity supported known-groups validity. Finally, large and statistically significant differences in change scores from Day 1 to Week 12 for patients defined as responders versus non-responders using the American College of Rheumatology 20 criteria supported the responsiveness of both PROs.

Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-RA measured daily activity and work productivity. At weeks 12 and 24, pain was assessed using pain reduction (< 30%, 30% to < 50%, ‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ‚àû¬¨‚Ä¢ 50%) and overall pain score; clinically relevant FACIT-F changes were assessed by values < 3.56 and ‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ‚àû¬¨‚Ä¢ 3.56 and the FACIT-F normative value score (< 40.1, ‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ‚àû¬¨‚Ä¢ 40.1). Pairwise comparisons between pain/fatigue reduction groups were assessed using ANCOVA with pooled data on daily activity and work productivity. A mediator analysis with pain, fatigue, and disease activity measured their contribution to daily activity and work productivity. Data were pooled from all patients for most analyses, and baricitinib-treated patients were assessed as a sensitivity analysis. Results: reductions in pain (‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ‚àû¬¨‚Ä¢ 50%) and fatigue (‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ‚àû¬¨‚Ä¢ 3.56) had significant (p ‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ‚àû¬¨¬ß 0.001) effects on daily activity and work productivity improvement at weeks 12 and 24. Reductions in pain, fatigue, and disease activity accounted for most of the improvements in daily activity and work productivity. At the lowest levels of remaining pain (‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ‚àû¬¨¬ß 10‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†mm) at weeks 12 and 24, however, fatigue did not appear to impact work productivity. Similar trends were observed with baricitinib-treated patients. Conclusions: reductions in pain and fatigue were associated with improved daily activity and work productivity for all RA patients and for baricitinib-treated patients in RA-BEAM.

TNFalpha plays an important role in the development of both Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. In a large, double-blind, randomised study involving patients with active, refractory Crohn's disease, significantly more recipients of intravenous infliximab, compared with placebo, achieved a clinical response after 4 weeks' follow-up. Moreover, infliximab administration was associated with a rapid improvement in endoscopic and histological findings in clinical trials involving patients with active, refractory Crohn's disease. The results of the A Crohn's Disease Clinical Trial Evaluating Infliximab in a New Long-Term Treatment Regimen (ACCENT) I study showed that maintenance infliximab therapy prolonged response and remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. In patients with enterocutaneous fistulae associated with Crohn's disease who were involved in a double-blind, randomised study, significantly more patients who received multiple infusions of infliximab, compared with placebo, experienced a >=50% reduction from baseline in the number of draining fistulae at >=2 consecutive study visits. In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis refractory to treatment with methotrexate who were enrolled in a large, double-blind, randomised study [the Anti-TNF Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis with Concomitant Therapy (ATTRACT) study], American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, 50 and 70% response rates were seen in significantly more patients who received multiple infusions of infliximab plus methotrexate, compared with methotrexate plus placebo, after 30 and 54 weeks' treatment. Moreover, the ACR 20% response rate was maintained after 102 weeks' treatment. In addition, significantly less radiographic progression was seen in infliximab plus methotrexate, compared with methotrexate plus placebo, recipients after 54 weeks' treatment. Infliximab therapy was also associated with improvements in health-related quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis. Infliximab was generally well tolerated in clinical trials with the most common adverse events including upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nausea, coughing, sinusitis and diarrhoea. Infliximab therapy may be associated with an increased risk of reactivation of tuberculosis in patients with latent disease. In conclusion, infliximab is an important treatment option in patients with active Crohn's disease who have not responded to conventional therapy and in patients with Crohn's disease who have fistulae. Moreover, infliximab plus methotrexate is effective in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded adequately to traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, in terms of reducing symptoms and signs, improving physical function and delaying the progression of structural damage."

This abstract examines the effects of BARI on disease activity scores and the improvement of disease activity compared to PBO and ADA utilizing CDAI, which does not include acute phase reactants and only uses clinical measures (adding physician and patient global assessments, to tender and swollen joint counts). Methods: in RA-BEAM, 1305 patients were treated with PBO (N = 488), ADA (N = 330) or BARI 4-mg (N = 487), while continuing to receive background MTX. CDAI for the three treatment groups was determined at baseline (mean [SD] of 37.6 [12.8], 38.1 [12.0], 37.9 [13.0] for PBO, BARI, and ADA, respectively) and at each visit post baseline up to 24 weeks, and for BARI and ADA groups up to 52 weeks. In this analysis, CDAI and the improvement from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 were compared between treatment groups using ANCOVA. The proportion of patients reaching a disease activity and improvement threshold at Weeks 12 and 24 were compared between treatment groups using logistic models. Analyses were not adjusted for multiplicity. Missing values were imputed using modified last observation carried forward. Results: at baseline, across all treatment arms, 91% of patients had high disease activity and 9% had moderate disease activity. Treatment with BARI resulted in significantly lower mean disease activity than PBO (p < 0.001 at Weeks 12 and 24) and ADA (p = 0.008, Week 12; p = 0.035, Week 24).

9256839,,10.3892/etm.2018.6495,"The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional synthetic or biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). A total of 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The primary effective outcome was the RA improvement to reach an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response rate. The safety outcomes were composed of clinical laboratory parameters. All patients included received 4 mg baricitinib once daily to treat RA for 12 or 24 weeks. The ACR20 response rate in the baricitinib group was significantly higher compared with that in the control group at 12 weeks [relative risk (RR), 1.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.62-1.94; P<0.00001] and 24 weeks (RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.48-2.10; P<0.00001). Similarly, other effective outcome measures also exhibited significant improvements in the baricitinib group compared with those in the placebo group. Regarding the safety outcomes, no significant difference in adverse events (AEs) was identified at 12 weeks (P=0.14), but AEs were significantly higher in the baricitinib group compared with those in the control group at 24 weeks (P=0.03). Most laboratory values were significantly different between the baricitinib and placebo groups; however, the clinical significance of these changes remains to be determined. In summary, the present meta-analysis demonstrated that 4 mg baricitinib once daily was beneficial in patients with active RA with an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional synthetic or biological DMARDs. More high-quality RCTs are required to determine the sustained efficacy and the safety of baricitinib. Copyright ¬¨¬© 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved"

We describe the drug's safety profile of the drug with updated data from an on-going long-term extension (LTE) study. Methods: long-term safety of once-daily BARI was evaluated in the ""all-BARI-RA"" dataset, which includes all patients (pts) with active RA exposed to any BARI dose from 8 randomized trials (4 Ph3, 3 Ph2, 1 Ph1b) and 1 LTE study (data up to 01-Sept-2016). Previous all-BARI-RA analyses were provided for comparison (data up to 10-Aug-2015). Placebo (PBO) comparisons were evaluated for up to Wk 24 in the ""PBO 4-mg"" dataset from the 6 Ph2/3 trials in which pts were randomized to BARI 4mg, with censoring at rescue or treatment switch. Dose responses were evaluated based on the 4 Ph2/3 trials in which pts were randomized to 2 or 4mg and includes data from the LTE (the ""2-4mg-extended"" dataset). Because of the latent period for malignancy, 2-4mg-extended was also analyzed without censoring for rescue or dose change (as-randomized analysis). Incidence rates (IRs) per 100 patient-years (PYs) were calculated. Results: in the current analysis, 3492 pts received BARI for 6637 total PYs of exposure (an increase of over 2400 PYs from previous analysis); maximum exposure was 5.5 yrs. No differences were seen for BARI 4mg vs PBO in adverse events (AEs) leading to permanent study drug discontinuation, death, malignancy, serious infection, or major adverse cardiovascular event. Herpes zoster IR was significantly higher for BARI 4mg vs PBO (IR 4.3 vs 1.0; 4mg vs. PBO, respectively). In 2-4mg-extended, no significant differences were observed comparing BARI 2 vs 4mg for the above-mentioned events. Malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) IRs were 0.5 and 1.3 for 2 and 4mg, respectively, with as-treated analysis and 0.7 and 0.9 with as-randomized analysis.

Incidence rates (IR) per 100 patient-years (PY) were calculated. Results: 3492 patients received bari for 6637 total PYof exposure (>2400 PY increase from previous analysis); maximum exposure was 5.5 yrs. No differences were seen for bari 4 mg vs PBO in adverse events leading to permanent study drug discontinuation, death, malignancy, serious infection, or major adverse cardiovascular event. Herpes zoster IR was significantly higher for bari 4 mg vs PBO (IR 1.0 vs 4.3). In 2 mg-4 mg-extended, no significant differences were observed (2 mg vs 4 mg) for aforementioned events. Malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) IR were 0.5 and 1.3 for 2 mg and 4 mg, respectively (as-treated analysis) and 0.7 and 0.9 (as-randomized analysis). The IRs for aforementioned events and lymphoma (0.09), gastrointestinal perforation (0.05), and tuberculosis (0.15 all in endemic areas) in the current all-bari-RA were similar to previous reports. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to abnormal lab results. Conclusion: baricitinibmaintained a safety profile similar to previous reports1 and acceptable in the context of demonstrated efficacy.2,3"

METHODS: data from two Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled (RA-BUILD; and active-controlled [RA-BEAM]), clinical studies of the efficacy of baricitinib in adults with moderately to severely active RA were used. The psychometric properties of the single-item measure, Severity of Worst Tiredness, were assessed, including test-retest reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, known-groups validity, and responsiveness, using other patient- and clinician-reported outcomes frequently assessed in RA patients.
RESULTS: test-retest reliability of the Severity of Worst Tiredness was supported through large intraclass correlation coefficients (0.89‚Äâ‚â§‚ÄâICC‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.91). Moderate-to-large correlations were observed between this patient-reported outcome (PRO) and other related patient- and clinician-reported assessments of RA symptoms and patient functioning, supporting construct validity of the measure (‚îÇr‚îÇ‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ0.41). The instrument also displayed known-groups validity through statistically significant differences between mean values of the Severity of Worst Tiredness defined using other indicators of RA severity.

Methods: eligibility requirements included >6 swollen and tender joints and no prior biologic DMARD use. In RA-BUILD, cDMARD-IR pts with hsCRP>3.6 mg/L were randomized to PBO or bari (2 or 4 mg) once daily (QD).1 In RA-BEAM, MTX-IR pts with x-ray erosions and hsCRP>6.0 mg/L were randomized to PBO QD, bari 4 mg QD, or adalimumab 40 mg biweekly.2 Primary endpoint in both trials was ACR20 at Wk 12 for bari 4 mg vs. PBO. This post-hoc analysis combined data from both trials providing overall samples for bari 4 mg (N=714) and PBO (N=716). The geographically-defined subpopulations were US/Puerto Rico  and ROW. Descriptive statistics were utilized for efficacy and safety analyses. Results: there were 188 US/PR and 1,242 ROW pts in this analysis. The proportions of pts who were White or Black/African- American were higher in US/PR; Asians were more represented in ROW. US/PR pts were slightly older, with fewer years of RA, and a lower percentage were RF/ACPA positive or used corticosteroids. More US/PR pts had previously used 1 cDMARD and more ROW had previously used >3cDMARDs (Table 1). Bari 4 mg demonstrated better responses vs. PBO across US/PR and ROW for multiple efficacy outcomes, including ACR20/50/70, LDA, remission, DAS28-CRP, and HAQ-DI (Table 2). Comparing US/PR and ROW efficacy, no systematic differences were observed. No significant safety differences were identified for US/PR or ROW pts at Wk 12 for bari 4 mg vs. PBO in the incidence of >1 adverse event (AE), serious AE, or discontinuation due to AE or death (Table 3).

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are considered important in RA; however, some symptoms such as morning joint stiffness (MJS) and fatigue that are considered important by patients are not captured by the American College of Rheumatology ""core set"" measures for RA trials. The US Food and Drug Administration has endorsed electronic capture of clinical trial data including PROs, and electronic PRO (ePRO) systems may lead to more accurate and complete data capture, improved compliance, and patient acceptance compared with paper-based methods. Our objective was to assess the implementation of ePRO measures of Duration and Severity of MJS, Severity of Worst Tiredness, and Severity of Worst Joint Pain in baricitinib RA-BEAM and RA-BUILD phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Methods: a daily electronic diary (handheld device; Invivodata¬¨√Ü, Inc.) was utilized to capture PRO data in the RCTs. Three ""reporting window"" options were incorporated to accommodate differences in patients' routine daily schedules, and alarms were programmed for each reporting window. Duration of MJS was recorded in ""hours and minutes,"" and Severity of MJS, Worst Tiredness, and Worst Joint Pain were captured on a 0 to 10 rating scale, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms. The patients and site staff were trained to use the daily electronic diary. Results: patients with moderately to severely active RA used the daily electronic diary in the RA-BEAM study (N = 1305) and RA-BUILD study (N = 684). The average compliance, calculated as total days completed by patients compared with total days expected to complete the diary, through Week 12 was high (RA-BEAM 94% patients; RA-BUILD 93% patients), potentially attributable to appropriate training, clarity of instructions, simple user interface, and electronic device design. Identified process challenges included non-timely issuance of the device, low battery, inadequate training of patients before data collection, inappropriate diary set-up, and first response entry 1 day after the baseline visit. Conclusions: high compliance rates support the use of the daily electronic PRO diary in large RCTs. Despite the anticipated issues, the daily electronic diary is expected to reduce recall bias and improve the quality of PRO data collection.

METHODS: patients completed 1 of 3 phase 3 baricitinib trials (NCT01711359, NCT01710358, NCT01721057) and entered the long-term extension RA-BEYOND (NCT01885078), in which patients received once-daily 4 mg or 2 mg baricitinib. Across these trials, patients initially receiving methotrexate (MTX) or adalimumab switched to baricitinib 4 mg at week 52. Patients initially receiving placebo switched to baricitinib 4 mg at week 24. Radiographs were scored at baseline and years 2, 3, 4, and 5. Change from baseline in van der Heijde modified Total Sharp Score (?mTSS) was computed. RESULTS: overall, 2125/2573 (82.6%) randomized patients entered RA-BEYOND; 1837/2125 (86.4%) entered this analysis.

In the phase 3 study RA-BUILD (NCT01721057),once-daily bari yielded significant clinical benefit in patients (pts) with active RA who had inadequate response or intolerance to conventional synthetic DMARDs compared to placebo (PBO).1 Changes in serum biomarkers2 associated with joint tissue remodeling, including synovial remodeling and inflammation (C1M, C3M, and C4M [matrix metalloproteinase-derived fragments of type I, lll, and IV collagen, respectively] and ProC3 [N-terminal pro-peptide type III collagen]),cartilage degradation (C2M [derived from type ll collagen]), and bone remodeling (CTX-I [C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen] and osteocalcin) were analyzed in a subset (N=240) of these pts. Methods: circulating levels of biomarkers from eighty patients per arm (PBO, bari 2- or 4-mg [added to stable background therapy]) were analyzed at baseline (BL), week (Wk) 4, and Wk 12, using a Mixed Model Repeated Measure method to identify markers that are affected by bari longitudinally. Secondly, an analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the relationship between the observed changes in biomarkers at Wks 4 and 12 (grouped as reduction or increase from BL) and the Hybrid ACR response measure (a hybrid of ordinal and continuous versions of ACR scores)3 at the primary endpoint of Wk 12. Results: baseline concentrations of biomarkers tested were similar between all three groups. At Wk 4, C1M was reduced by 21% from BL by bari 4-mg compared to PBO (p<0.01); suppression was sustained at Wk 12(27%, p<0.001). Similarly, at Wk 4, C3M and C4M were reduced by 14% and 12% from BL by bari 4-mg compared to PBO (p<0.001), respectively, and remained reduced by 16% or 11% from BL at Wk 12 (p<0.001). Similar results were observed with bari 2-mg. Bari treatment did not result in appreciable changes compared to PBO for the other biomarkers tested. We further determined the relationship between changes in biomarkers in RA pts and clinical response, as measured by the Hybrid ACR score (Table). In a pooled analysis with all three treatment arms, are duction in C1M, C3M, and C4M by Wks 4 and 12 was associated with significantly greater clinical improvement in the Hybrid ACR response at Wk 12 compared to pts with RA having increased levels of these biomarkers. Conclusion: a reduction in circulating biomarkers associated with tissue destruction and synovial inflammation in RA pts was observed in bari-treated RA pts, suggesting that bari inhibits key pathological processes at the site of inflammation in RA. Moreover, the decrease in these biomarkers was associated with clinical improvement. (Figure Presented)"

In the phase 3 study RA-BUILD (NCT01721057),once-daily bari yielded significant clinical benefit in patients (pts) with active RA who had inadequate response or intolerance to conventional synthetic DMARDs compared to placebo (PBO).1 Changes in serum biomarkers2 associated with joint tissue remodeling, including synovial remodeling and inflammation (C1M, C3M, and C4M [matrix metalloproteinase-derived fragments of type I, lll, and IV collagen, respectively] and ProC3 [N-terminal pro-peptide type III collagen]),cartilage degradation (C2M [derived from type ll collagen]), and bone remodeling (CTX-I [C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen] and osteocalcin) were analyzed in a subset (N=240) of these pts. Method(s): Circulating levels of biomarkers from eighty patients per arm (PBO, bari 2- or 4-mg [added to stable background therapy]) were analyzed at baseline (BL), week (Wk) 4, and Wk 12, using a Mixed Model Repeated Measure method to identify markers that are affected by bari longitudinally. Secondly, an analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the relationship between the observed changes in biomarkers at Wks 4 and 12 (grouped as reduction or increase from BL) and the Hybrid ACR response measure (a hybrid of ordinal and continuous versions of ACR scores)3 at the primary endpoint of Wk 12. Result(s): Baseline concentrations of biomarkers tested were similar between all three groups. At Wk 4, C1M was reduced by 21% from BL by bari 4-mg compared to PBO (p<0.01); suppression was sustained at Wk 12(27%, p<0.001). Similarly, at Wk 4, C3M and C4M were reduced by 14% and 12% from BL by bari 4-mg compared to PBO (p<0.001), respectively, and remained reduced by 16% or 11% from BL at Wk 12 (p<0.001). Similar results were observed with bari 2-mg. Bari treatment did not result in appreciable changes compared to PBO for the other biomarkers tested. We further determined the relationship between changes in biomarkers in RA pts and clinical response, as measured by the Hybrid ACR score (Table). In a pooled analysis with all three treatment arms, are duction in C1M, C3M, and C4M by Wks 4 and 12 was associated with significantly greater clinical improvement in the Hybrid ACR response at Wk 12 compared to pts with RA having increased levels of these biomarkers. Conclusion(s): A reduction in circulating biomarkers associated with tissue destruction and synovial inflammation in RA pts was observed in bari-treated RA pts, suggesting that bari inhibits key pathological processes at the site of inflammation in RA. Moreover, the decrease in these biomarkers was associated with clinical improvement. (Figure Presented)."

METHODS: In this 6-week, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial with optional 6-month open-label extension (NCT00993668), patients were stratified by concomitant methotrexate (MTX) use and randomized to receive CZP 400 mg (loading dose; according to CZP label) or placebo at weeks 0, 2, and 4. Pneumococcal (polysaccharide 23) and influenza vaccines were administered at Week 2. Satisfactory humoral immune response, defined as ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢2-fold titer increase in ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢3 of 6 pneumococcal antigens and ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢4-fold titer increase in ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢2 of 3 influenza antigens, were assessed independently 4 weeks after vaccination.
RESULTS: Following pneumococcal vaccination, 62.5% of placebo patients and 54.5% of CZP patients without effective titers at baseline achieved a humoral response (difference in proportions was -8.0 percentage points; 95% CI -22.5 to 6.6%). Following influenza vaccination, 61.4% of placebo and 53.5% of CZP patients without effective titers at baseline achieved a humoral response (difference in proportions: -8.0 percentage points; 95% CI -22.9 to 7.0%). In all patients, including those with effective titers at baseline, 58.2% of placebo and 53.3% of CZP patients developed satisfactory pneumococcal titers, and 54.1% of placebo and 50.5% of CZP patients developed satisfactory influenza antibody titers.

METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of the randomized, double-blind RAPID 1 study in patients who received methotrexate (MTX) and either CZP 200 mg subcutaneously or placebo every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. Clinical and radiographic outcomes at Week 52 were evaluated based on the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 1.2 and American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) responses at Week 6 and Week 12.
RESULTS: Clinical responses [European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), DAS28 ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 1.2, and ACR20 responses] were rapid in CZP-treated patients. Week 12 DAS28 ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 1.2 responders had better clinical and radiographic outcomes at Week 52 compared with nonresponders. Among Week 12 responders, incremental benefit of earlier response was observed: Week 6 DAS28 ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 1.2 responders and ACR20 responders had significantly higher ACR response rates and were more likely to achieve remission at Week 52 than Week 12 responders. Patients with a clinical response at Week 6 had faster, more meaningful sustained improvements in patient-derived outcomes than those responding by Week 12 only.
CONCLUSION: Rapid attainment of clinical response in patients with RA is associated with improved longterm outcomes. Analysis of the kinetics of response to CZP during the first 12 weeks of therapy potentially permits informed prediction of clinical success or need to alter treatment. In patients not achieving a clinical response at Week 12 treatment adjustment should be considered. Trial registration NCT00152386."
9263368,,10.3899/jrheum.111171,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between timing and magnitude of Disease Activity Score [DAS28(ESR)] nonresponse (DAS28 improvement thresholds not reached) during the first 12 weeks of treatment with certolizumab pegol (CZP) plus methotrexate, and the likelihood of achieving low disease activity (LDA) at 1 year in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: In a post-hoc analysis of the RAPID 1 study, patients achieving LDA [DAS28(ESR) ‚Äö√¢¬ß 3.2] at Year 1 were assessed according to DAS28 nonresponse at various timepoints within the first 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Seven-hundred eighty-three patients were included (CZP 200 mg, n = 393; CZP 400 mg, n = 390). A total of 86.9% of patients in the CZP 200 mg group had a DAS28 improvement of ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 1.2 by Week 12. Of the 13.1% of patients with DAS28 improvement < 1.2 by Week 12, only 2.0% had LDA at Year 1. Failure to achieve LDA at Year 1 depended on timing of nonresponse - 22.3%, 8.4%, and 2.0% of patients with DAS28 improvement < 1.2 by Weeks 1, 6, and 12, respectively, had LDA at Year 1 - and magnitude of initial lack of DAS28 improvement; for example, compared with the patients with DAS28 < 1.2 improvement, fewer patients with DAS28 < 0.6 had LDA at Year 1 (17.4%, 2.4%, and 0.0% at Weeks 1, 6, and 12, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Failure to achieve improvement in DAS28 within the first 12 weeks of therapy was predictive of a low probability of achieving LDA at Year 1. Moreover, the accuracy of the prediction was found to be strongly dependent on the magnitude and timing of the lack of the response. (Clinical Trial Registration Nos. NCT00152386 and NCT00175877)."

This post hoc analysis of the REALISTIC study assessed the performance of RAPID3 and RADAI to measure impact of treatment with certolizumab pegol (CZP) in a broad population of RA pts closely resembling routine clinical practice. Methods: During the 12-week (wk), double-blind phase of the REALISTIC study 1063 pts with inadequate response to >1 DMARD were randomized 4:1 to CZP 400 mg at Wks 0, 2, and 4, followed by 200 mg at Wks 6, 8, and 10, or placebo (PBO), added to their current treatment. The RADAI (summarized as a joint tenderness score [JS] or the total score [TS], both ranging 0 to 10, with 10 indicating highest DA) was administered at 0, 2, 6, and 12 wks. Mean change from baseline in RADAI-TS was assessed using ANCOVA applying LOCF (CZP vs PBO). The percentage of patients achieving a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the RADAI-TS was evaluated (defined as a 1-point decrease). Correlations between RADAI-TS, RADAI-JS, RAPID3, and clinical DA measures (including DAS28[ESR] and total and swollen joint counts [TJC, SJC]) were examined using Pearson coefficients. Results: Mean baseline RAPID3 and RADAI-TS were similar between groups (CZP vs PBO: RAPID3 14.75 vs 15.50, RADAI-TS 5.56 vs 5.68). Statistically significant improvements in RAPID3 and RADAI-TS were reported with CZP vs PBO from as early as Wk 2 up to Wk 12. Significantly more CZP pts had improvements >MCID in RADAI and achieved RAPID3 low DA or remission from Wk 2 onward. Correlations between RADAI (TS and JS) or RAPID3 and DAS28(ESR) were high, while correlations between RADAI-TS and RAPID3 were very high. Patient reported scoring of the joint for tenderness in the RADAI highly correlated with physician-reported TJC and moderately with SJC. Responsiveness of RADAI and RAPID3 was good, especially in patients with moderate or high number of affected joints at baseline. Conclusion: Rapid and significant improvements in RAPID3 and RADAI were observed within the first 3 months of CZP treatment in a broad population of RA patients. RADAI and RAPID3 may represent reliable patient reported measures of disease activity in RA patients."

9261161,,10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001395,"Background: To date no randomized trial has compared two different TNF inhibitors for RA. Our goal was to compare adalimumab against etanercept in patients with active RA who had not responded to, or were unable to tolerate, two disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate (MTX). Methods: One hundred and twenty five patients who met national criteria for treatment with a TNF inhibitor in regard to lack of response to at least two DMARDs including MTX were randomized to adalimumab 40mg every other week or etanercept 50mg weekly subcutaneously. The primary outcome was continuation with therapy after 52 weeks. This was a pragmatic randomized (1:1) open-label study designed to demonstrate that adalimumab was not inferior to etanercept by a margin of 15% in terms of drug continuation. Treatment allocation was stratified by baseline MTX use. No constraints were imposed on changes in the dose of methotrexate, use of other DMARDs, including those that had not been tried previously, or on use of oral, parenteral or intra-articular corticosteroids. Results: Patient characteristics at baseline were similar: overall 88% of patients were rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibody positive and 66.7% of patients took MTX at baseline. After 52 weeks 39 out of 60 (65%) of patients allocated adalimumab were still on treatment compared with 34/60 (56.7%) allocated etanercept. Five patients who did not start allocated treatment were excluded from the analyses. The one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the proportion still taking adalimumab minus the proportion on etanercept was>-7.9%, demonstrating non-inferiority at the 15% margin. At 52 weeks the proportion of good, moderate and non-responders based on DAS28-CRP were 26.3%, 33.3%, and 40.4% for adalimumab versus 16.7%, 31.7%, and 51.7% for etanercept (p=0.158). Changes in DAS28(CRP4) from baseline were a mean of -1.54 (standard deviation (SD) 1.47) for adalimumab compared with -1.34 (SD 1.33) for etanercept (p=0.469). The baseline median EQ-5D scores were 0.52 for both groups. After 52 weeks, or on withdrawal, scores were improved on adalimumab to 0.62 compared with 0.59 for etanercept (p=0.015). Global satisfaction, effectiveness, side effects, and convenience scores based on the Treatment Satisfaction Score (version 2) at 52 weeks or on withdrawal were 83.3, 66.7, 91.7, 83.3 for adalimumab compared with 75.0, 66.7, 91.7, and 83.3 for etanercept (p not significant for all domains). Fourteen serious adverse events occurred including two deaths from myocardial infarction, one patient who developed ovarian cancer and one with acute myeloid leukaemia. Conclusions: Adalimumab and etanercept, when compared on the basis of drug continuation at 52 weeks and disease activity scores, are similarly effective in patients with RA not responding favourably to two or more DMARDs including MTX."

Methods: a randomised, double-blind, pharmacokinetic similarity trial was conducted in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis refractory to anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy on a background of methotrexate. Patients were treated with 1000 mg of PF-05280586, rituximab-EU or rituximab-US on days 1 and 15 and followed over 24 weeks for pharmacokinetic, clinical response and safety assessments. Key secondary end points were the areas under effect curves for DAS28 and ACR responses. Mean differences in areas under effect curves were compared against respective reference ranges established by observed rituximab-EU and rituximab-US responses using longitudinal nonlinear mixed effects models. Results: the analysis included 214 patients. Demographics were similar across groups with exceptions in some baseline disease characteristics. Baseline imbalances and group-to-group variation were accounted for by covariate effects in each model. Predictions from the DAS28 and ACR models tracked the central tendency and distribution of observations well. No point estimates of mean differences were outside the reference range for DAS28 or ACR scores. The probabilities that the predicted differences between PF-05280586 vs. rituximab-EU or rituximab-US lie outside the reference ranges were low. Conclusions: no clinically meaningful differences were detected in DAS28 or ACR response between PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU or rituximab-US as the differences were within the pre-specified reference ranges.

9739036,,10.3899/jrheum.080663,"Objective: To explore whether the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) are predictors of disease activity after a second course of Rituximab (RTX) treatment. Methods: In the 24-week phase III REFLEX trial (A&R, 2006;54), RA patients with past inadequate response (IR) to one or more TNF inhibitors were randomized to RTX or placebo + methotrexate. During open-label extension, physicians chose patients who had achieved >=20% improvement in SJC, TJC to receive further courses of RTX. This study includes patients who received a first course (C1) of RTX and a second course (C2) during extension, with SDAI and CDAI calculated ~every 4 weeks. Using a generalized linear mixed model fit to all visits after C2, the effects of the following variables were evaluated at weeks 12-24 after C2: pre-trial characteristics, SDAI/CDAI scores, HAQ-DI at various times, and time between courses. Results: 207 of the 298 patients who received RTX entered the extension. C2 was received by 173 patients, with 168 evaluable. These patients (82% female, 86% RF+, age 53+/-11) began C2 a median 43 weeks after C1. At data cut-off, their 24-week follow-ups after C2 were labeled as complete (n=138), not yet complete (n=5), or completed by imputation after patient withdrawal (n=25). The lowest mean SDAI and CDAI scores occurred at week 20 after both courses. The factors that independently increased SDAI and CDAI after C2 were 4-fold: baseline age, scores just prior to C2, SDAI/CDAI at week 20, and HAQ-DI at 16 weeks post-C1. For every 1.0 point that SDAI worsened before C2, there was a 0.21 point higher SDAI score post-C2. For CDAI, the same 1.0-point worsening resulted in a 0.24 point higher CDAI score. Non-significant predictors in the pre-trial characteristics (except age) included HAQ-DI immediately before C2, and time between courses. Conclusion: For RA patients who respond to RTX after IR to >=1 TNF inhibitors, these data suggest that SDAI or CDAI are predictors of the outcome of a second course of RTX; the less that disease activity, as measured by these two indexes, is allowed to worsen before repeating treatment, the better."
9263393,,10.3899/jrheum.120573,"OBJECTIVE: this 5-year observational posthoc analysis of the REFLEX study and its open-label extension assessed clinical efficacy, radiographic response, and safety of rituximab (RTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.
METHODS: patients in REFLEX were originally randomized to placebo (PBO) + methotrexate (MTX; PBO-randomized) or RTX + MTX (RTX-randomized). PBO-randomized patients were rescued with RTX as appropriate. Patients responding to initial RTX treatment could receive further RTX courses. For clinical efficacy and safety analyses, PBO-randomized patients were re-baselined prior to first RTX treatment and the data were pooled with RTX-randomized patient data. Efficacy outcomes 24 weeks after each course were calculated relative to first RTX pretreatment baseline. Radiographic outcomes were assessed relative to randomization baseline for both PBO-randomized and RTX-randomized groups.
RESULTS: a total of 480 patients received ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 1 RTX course. At 24 weeks, American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 responses were 62.0%, 30.8%, and 13.0%, respectively at course 1 (n = 400) and 70.3%, 41.8%, and 22.0% at course 5 (n = 91). European League Against Rheumatism good/moderate responses were 77.2% and 84.4% at courses 1 (n = 390) and 5 (n = 90). Rates of adverse events (AE), serious AE, and infections generally remained stable. Rate of progressive joint damage (PJD; change in mean Total Sharp Score) decreased over time in both PBO-randomized (n = 79) and RTX-randomized (n = 105) groups. Mean change from baseline in PJD over 5 years was greater in PBO-randomized versus RTX-randomized patients (5.51 vs 3.21).
CONCLUSION: RTX re-treatment over 5 years is associated with maintained or improved efficacy, continued inhibition of PJD, and a safety profile consistent with that previously reported. A delay in initiating RTX treatment may result in increased PJD."

MBDA scores and ACPA status were determined in baseline samples of patients continuing DMARD (arm 1), tapering their dose by 50% (arm 2), or stopping after tapering (arm 3). Patients were followed over 1 year, and direct treatment costs were evaluated every 3 months. MBDA and ACPA status were used as predictors creating a risk-stratified tapering algorithm based on relapse rates., RESULTS: RA patients with a low MBDA score (< 30 units) and negative ACPA showed the lowest relapse risk (19%), while double-positive patients showed high relapse risk (61%). In ACPA-negative and MBDA-negative (< 30 units), and ACPA or MBDA single-positive (> 30 units) groups, DMARD tapering appears feasible. Considering only patients without flare, direct costs for synthetic and biologic DMARD in the ACPA/MBDA-negative and single positive groups (n = 41) would have been 372,245.16 for full-dose treatment over 1 year. Tapering and stopping DMARD in this low-risk relapse group allowed a reduction of 219,712.03 of DMARD costs. Average reduction of DMARD costs per patient was 5358.83., CONCLUSION: Combining MBDA score and ACPA status at baseline may allow risk stratification for successful DMARD tapering and cost-effective use of biologic DMARD in patients in deep remission as defined by the 28-joint count Disease Activity Score using erythrocyte sedimentation rate."

9258033,,10.3899/jrheum.140572,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the probability of clinical remission (REM) or low disease activity (LDA) after 1 year of infliximab (IFX) therapy based on disease activity at 3 months in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Methotrexate-refractory patients with RA received 3 mg/kg of IFX at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks from Week 14 (W14) to Week 46. Correlation of disease activity at W14 with disease activity at W54 and probability of REM/LDA at W54 were analyzed in each dosing group.
RESULTS: Disease activities at W14 were significantly correlated with both disease activity at W54 and probability of REM/LDA at W54 in patients continuing 3 mg/kg as well as in those receiving 6 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg therapy from W14. Results showed that, if approximate REM or LDA had not been achieved by W14, > 50% of patients continuing 3 mg/kg therapy would not be able to achieve REM or LDA at W54. However, even in patients with high or moderate disease activity at W14, dose escalation to 6 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg enabled many to achieve REM/LDA.
CONCLUSION: Disease activity at W14 in standard-dose IFX therapy enabled the prediction of longterm clinical response at continued standard dose, as well as subsequent escalated-dose regimens. Disease activity at W14 was hypothesized to be an important index for IFX treatment strategy."

Due to various nonspecific symptoms, many different medical specialities are involved in diagnostic and therapeutic regimes of patients with pSS. Therefore broad knowledge of symptoms and therapeutic options is important. Effective management of xerostomia, keratoconjunctivis sicca (KCS), and rhinitis sicca (RS) is essential in every patient to alleviate symptoms and prevent local complications. Various substitutes with different ingredients are available for topical and symptomatic therapy, but there are no generally accepted treatment suggestions due to the lack of studies proving effective relief of symptoms.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: between October 2007 and August 2012, pSS was diagnosed in 73¬†patients according to the American European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria. Before and after a 2-month period of treatment with liposomal agents for oral, nasal, and ocular complaints (LipoSaliva¬Æ, LipoNasal¬Æ, and Tears Again¬Æ,) AECG criteria and subjective symptoms were evaluated using visual analogue scales.
RESULTS: xerostomia (92‚Äâ%), KCS (92‚Äâ%), and recurrent salivary gland swelling (40‚Äâ%) were the leading clinical symptoms. Mean salivary flow rate was 1.89¬†g (Saxon test), mean lacrimal flow 12.7¬†mm (Schirmer¬†I test). SS-A and -B antibodies could be detected in 47¬†patients (29‚Äâ%). An average histologic focus score of 3 was assigned (Chisholm and Mason). Extraglandular manifestations were observed in 17‚Äâ%, while severe local complications due to ineffective treatment of sicca symptoms were diagnosed in 70.5‚Äâ%. Liposomal local therapy caused a significant reduction of xerostomia (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0001), KCS (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.004), and RS (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.004).
CONCLUSION: local therapy with liposomal agents is effective in the symptomatic treatment of xerostomia, KCS, and RS in patients with pSS."

However, about one third of RA patients do not respond to specific bDMARD treatment without clear identified reasons. Different bDMARDs must be tried until the right drug is found. Here, we sought to identify a predictive protein signature to stratify patient responsiveness to rituximab (RTX) among patients with an insufficient response to a first anti-TNFalpha treatment., METHODS: Serum samples were collected at baseline before RTX initiation. A proteomics study comparing responders and nonresponders was conducted to identify and select potential predictive biomarkers whose concentration was measured by quantitative assays. Logistic regression was performed to determine the best biomarker combination to predict good or nonresponse to RTX (EULAR criteria after 6 months' treatment)., RESULTS: Eleven biomarkers potentially discriminating between responders and nonresponders were selected following discovery proteomics. Quantitative immunoassays and univariate statistical analysis showed that fetuin-A and thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) presented a good capacity to discriminate between patient groups. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the combination of fetuin-A plus TBG could accurately predict a patient's responsiveness to RTX with an AUC of 0.86, sensitivity of 80%, and a specificity of 79%., CONCLUSION: In RA patients for whom a first anti-TNFalpha treatment has failed, the serum abundance of fetuin-A and TBG before initiating RTX treatment is an indicator for their response status at 6 months. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01000441.Key Points* Proteomic analysis revealed 11 putative predictive biomarkers to discriminate rituximab responder vs. nonresponder RA patients.* Fetuin-A and TBG are significantly differentially expressed at baseline in rituximab responder vs. nonresponder RA patients.* Algorithm combining fetuin-A and TBG accurately predicts response to rituximab in RA patients with insufficient response to TNFi."
9739509,,10.55563/clinexprheumatol/hfceu3,"Background/Purpose: in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), little is known about the prognostic relevance of the change in autoantibody (ab) levels. Seroconversion was reported to be associated with a better clinical and radiological outcome in MTX-insufficient responders (IRs) treated with abatacept (1). The ROC randomized study (2)offered the opportunity to investigate changes in RF and anti-CCP levels in 1st anti-TNF-IR patients treated either with a 2nd anti-TNF, abatacept, rituximab or tocilizumab. Objective: to evaluate the effects of bDMARDS on rheumatoid factor (RF) and IgG, A and M anti-CCP ab in RA, and associations between changes in serological status and clinical and radiological responses. Methods: ab titres (IgM-RF, IgG, A and M-anti-CCP) were determined by ELISA at baseline and month 6 in respectively 230, 220, 242 and 241 patients enrolled in the ROC randomized trial. The association between changes in ab titers with clinical response was assessed at months 6 and 12. Radiographs of the hands and feet were analyzed at screening and at months 12. The van Der Heijde-modified Sharp scoring method was used to assess the mean change from baseline in total Sharp score (TSS) and to determine radiographic progression. Results: seroconversion of IgM-RF (patients with IgM-RF present at baseline, and then that became undetectable after treatment) was observed in only 4 patients (2%), of IgG antiCCP in 15 (7%), of IgA in 17 (7%) and of IgM in 16 patients (7%). No significant difference in the proportion of patients converted to seronegative status was observed between patients treated with a 2nd anti-TNF or with a non-TNF targeted therapy. In the non anti-TNF group, seroconversion of IgA anti- CCP was significantly more frequent in rituximab (24%) than in abatacept (7%) or tocilizumab-treated patients (4%) (p=0.007). Seroconversion of RF was associated with a significantly more frequent remission (75% of patients with a DAS28-ESR<2.6 at month 6 among seroconverted patients vs 22% in patients who remained RF positive, p=0.01). IgA anti-CCP seroconversion was associated with a better therapeutic response (good EULAR response in 59% of seroconverted patients at month 12 vs 25% in patients who remained IgA anti-CCP positive, p=0.004). Seroconversions of IgM and IgG anti-CCP were not associated with any clinical or radiological response. RF levels decreased irrespectively of the biologic used whereas a significant decrease of anti-CCP isotypes was only observed with rituximab. The decrease of RF was correlated with the decrease of polyclonal B-cell activation markers (total IgG, IgA, IgM, kappa and lambda free light chains of immunoglobulins (FLCs), whereas IgG, IgA, IgM-anti-CCP were not correlated with total IgA, G, M or FLCs. Changes in RF or anti-CCP levels were not associated with clinical or radiographic outcome. Conclusion: seroconversion of RF and anti-CCP was infrequent. Seroconversion of RF was significantly associated with a more frequent DAS28-remission and seroconversion of IgA anti-CCP with a better EULAR response"

Sixty-seven patients with active disease completed a 24-week, open, randomized study of methotrexate (MTX) versus sulphasalazine (SSZ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Serum sIL-2R levels were evaluated before entry and after 24 weeks by ELISA. Serum sIL-2R were significantly higher in RA patients than in controls (P = 0.0001) and correlated significantly only with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.03) and with Chronic Arthritis Systemic Index (P = 0.01) at study entry. No correlation was found between serum sIL-2R and other laboratory and clinical indices of disease activity. After 24 weeks of treatment no differences in serum sIL-2R in comparison with basal levels were found in either responding or in non-responding patients, although the mean reduction of sIL-2R was more marked in the MTX-treated cohort than in the HCQ and SSZ-treated groups. These data suggest that in RA the measurement of sIL-2R should be used with caution as an isolated index of disease activity and that it is not a useful marker of response to treatment with second line drugs."

The aim of this extended follow-up was to evaluate the effects of the SARAH programme beyond 12‚ÄÖmonths.
METHODS: using postal questionnaires, we collected the Michigan Hand Questionnaire hand function (primary outcome), activities of daily living and work subscales, pain troublesomeness, self-efficacy and health-related quality of life. All participants were asked how often they performed hand exercises for their rheumatoid arthritis. Mean difference in hand function scores were analysed by a linear model, adjusted for baseline score.
RESULTS: two-thirds (n=328/490, 67%) of the original cohort provided data for the extended follow-up. The mean follow-up time was 26‚ÄÖmonths (range 19-40‚ÄÖmonths).There was no difference in change in hand function scores between the two groups at extended follow-up (mean difference (95% CI) 1.52 (-1.71 to 4.76)). However, exercise group participants were still significantly improved compared with baseline (p=0.0014) unlike the best practice usual care group (p=0.1122). Self-reported performance of hand exercises had reduced substantially.
CONCLUSIONS: participants undertaking the SARAH exercise programme had improved hand function compared with baseline >2‚ÄÖyears after randomisation. This was not the case for the control group. However, scores were no longer statistically different between the groups indicating the effect of the programme had diminished over time. This reduction in hand function compared with earlier follow-up points coincided with a reduction in self-reported performance of hand exercises. Further intervention to promote long-term adherence may be warranted.

The effectiveness of exercise for RA hands is uncertain, although evidence from small scale studies is promising. The Strengthening And Stretching for Rheumatoid Arthritis of the Hand (SARAH) trial is a pragmatic, multi-centre randomised controlled trial evaluating the clinical and cost effectiveness of adding an optimised exercise programme for hands and upper limbs to best practice usual care for patients with RA. Methods/design. 480 participants with problematic RA hands will be recruited through 17 NHS trusts. Treatments will be provided by physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Participants will be individually randomised to receive either best practice usual care (joint protection advice, general exercise advice, functional splinting and assistive devices) or best practice usual care supplemented with an individualised exercise programme of strengthening and stretching exercises. The study assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation and will follow participants up at four and 12 months. The primary outcome measure is the Hand function subscale of the Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire, and secondary outcomes include hand and wrist impairment measures, quality of life, and resource use. Economic and qualitative studies will also be carried out in parallel. Discussion. This paper describes the design and development of a trial protocol of a complex intervention study based in therapy out-patient departments. The findings will provide evidence to support or refute the use of an optimised exercise programme for RA of the hand in addition to best practice usual care. Trial registration.

Methods: adults with RA (n = 132) were randomized to receive subcutaneous sarilumab (150 [n = 65] or 200‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†mg [n = 67]) every 2‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†weeks (q2w) for 24‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†weeks. Endpoints included incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) at week 24, safety, and efficacy. Results: persistent ADAs occurred in eight patients (12.3%) receiving sarilumab 150‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†mg q2w, seven of whom (10.8%) had neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), and in four patients (6.1%) receiving sarilumab 200‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†mg q2w, two of whom (3.0%) had NAbs; all exhibited low antibody titers. Infections and neutropenia were the most common adverse events (AEs). There were three serious AEs, no reports of anaphylaxis, and few hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash) with no notable differences in hypersensitivity reactions in ADA-positive patients relative to ADA-negative patients. Changes in absolute neutrophil count, alanine aminotransferase level, and platelet count were consistent with interleukin-6 signaling blockade and in agreement with previous observations. At week 24, overall American College of Rheumatology 20%/50%/70% improvement criteria responses were 73.8%/53.8%/29.2%, respectively, with sarilumab 150‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†mg q2w and 71.6%/50.7%/29.9% with sarilumab 200‚àö√á¬¨‚Ä†mg q2w. No patients with an ADA-positive response showed loss of efficacy. Conclusions: ADA titers were low and persistent ADAs and NAbs occurred relatively infrequently in both sarilumab dose groups.

Despite the availability of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), a substantial proportion of patients with RA do not achieve these treatment targets. Upadacitinib is a once-daily, oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor with increased selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2. The SELECT phase III upadacitinib clinical program comprised five pivotal trials of approximately 4400 patients with RA, including inadequate responders (IR) to conventional synthetic (cs)DMARDs or bDMARDs. This review aims to provide insights into the benefit-risk profile of upadacitinib in patients with RA. Upadacitinib 15 mg once daily, in combination with csDMARDs or as monotherapy, achieved all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in the five pivotal trials across csDMARD-naive, csDMARD-IR, and bDMARD-IR populations. Upadacitinib 15 mg also demonstrated significantly higher rates of remission and low disease activity in all five pivotal trials, compared with placebo, methotrexate, or adalimumab. Labeled warnings of JAK inhibitors include serious infections, herpes zoster, malignancies, major cardiovascular events, and venous thromboembolic events. Short- and long-term integrated analyses showed that upadacitinib 15 mg was associated with increased risk of herpes zoster and creatine phosphokinase elevations compared with methotrexate and adalimumab but otherwise had comparable safety with these active comparators. This review suggests that upadacitinib 15 mg had a favorable benefit-risk profile. The safety of upadacitinib will continue to be monitored in long-term extensions and post-marketing studies.Copyright ¬© 2021, The Author(s)."

The purpose of this anal-ysis was todetermine the association between PROs and composite outcomes in RA patients receiving the JAK1-selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (UPA), with prior inadequate responses (IR) to conventional synthetic (cs) or biologic (b) DMARD(s). Methods: data were analyzed from two 12-week (wk), phase 3, RCTs in csDMARD-IR (SELECT-NEXT) and bDMARD-IR (SELECT-BEYOND) patients receiving UPA 15 or 30 mg daily (QD) or placebo and background csDMARD ther-apy; as well as from a third trial (SELECT-MONOTHERAPY), in which MTX-IR patients received UPA monotherapy or MTX (blinded) for 14 wks. Moderate and substantial improvements in pain (‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢30% and ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢50% improvement from baseline [≈í√Æ BL], respectively), and normative values in HAQ-DI (‚Äö√¢¬ß0.25) and functional as-sessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue (FACIT-F: ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢43.6, SELECT-NEXT only) were evaluated. Associations between clinical outcomes (TJC, SJC, physician global assessment [MDGA], CRP and composite measures [ACR, DAS28-CRP, CDAI]), and PROs (pain [VAS], HAQ-DI, patient global assessment [PtGA], morning stiff-ness, FACIT-F) were evaluated through Pearson correlations and a univariate logistic model, controlling for treatment group and BL value. Results: patients enrolledinthe SELECT-NEXTand SELECT-BEYOND trials had moderate to severely active RA (mean DAS28-CRP: 5.6 and 5.8, respec-tively), with disease durations of 7 and 12 years, respectively. In general, ≈í√ÆBL in pain and HAQ-DI scores were marginally correlated with individual physician-derived measures (SELECT-NEXT: pain, 0.161-0.537, HAQ-DI, 0.081-0.425; SELECT-BEYOND: pain, 0.131-0.511, HAQ-DI, 0.052-0.409); moreover, moderate to high correlations were observed between pain, HAQ-DI and PtGA in both RCTs (SELECT-NEXT: pain, 0.835-0.851, HAQ-DI, 0.418-0.518; SELECT-BEYOND: pain, 0.828-0.871, HAQ-DI, 0.479-0.520). In regres-sion analyses, improvements in individual disease assessments were associated with significant improvements in pain at Wk12 across RCTs. In addition, patients with improvement in composite measures were more likely to report substantial improvements in pain. Similar associations were evident for HAQ-DI scores at Wk12 across RCTs (including SELECT-MONOTHERAPY), as well as for FACIT-F in SELECT-NEXT. Conclusions: achieving substantial improvements in pain, physical function, and fatigue was associated both with individual physician-derived measures and with composite disease outcomes. These data support the use of PROs in RCTs and also imply that, although PROs may be included in composite end-points, they are distinct parameters that provide additional insights into the true impact of RA"

Methods: Patients in SELECT-CHOICE received UPA (oral 15 mg/day) or ABA (intravenous). PROs evaluated included Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGA) by visual analog scale (VAS), patient‚Äôs assessment of pain by VAS, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), morning stiffness duration and severity, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI), and EQ-5D 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) index score.

Proportions of patients reporting improvements ‚â• minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were compared using chi-square tests. Results: Data from 612 patients were analyzed (UPA, n=303; ABA, n=309). Mean age was 56 years and mean disease duration was 12 years. One-third received ‚â•2 prior bDMARDs and 72% received concomitant methotrexate at baseline.

Upadacitinib (UPA), a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is a new treatment for RA. The benefit‚Äìrisk profile of a medication is best understood by evaluating the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH). This analysis evaluated the comparative risk‚Äìbenefit of UPA versus adalimumab (ADA). Methods: Post-hoc analyses were performed using data from the SELECT-COMPARE trial of UPA versus placebo (PBO) and UPA versus ADA among patients with active RA who remained on stable methotrexate (MTX) treatment and had an inadequate response; patients who failed to achieve response were rescued by predefined criteria‚ÄîPBO or ADA switch to UPA, and UPA switch to ADA (all patients on PBO were switched to UPA at week 26). This analysis assessed efficacy and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) at week 26, 48, and 156 (3 years). NNT and NNH (95% confidence intervals) values were calculated between UPA versus ADA for all time points, and between UPA versus PBO for week 26. NNT and NNH values were applied to a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients to estimate the comparative efficacy and safety profiles. Results: UPA consistently showed greater efficacy than ADA, as evidenced by NNT values < 10 for achievement of Disease Activity Score in 28 joints based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) of < 2.6 and &les; 3.2, respectively, and functional improvement. Based on indices for disease assessment other than the DAS28-CRP, remission outcomes were higher with UPA versus ADA over 26 weeks (NNTs: 7‚Äì12), 48 weeks (NNTs: 9‚Äì16), and 156 weeks (NNTs: 9‚Äì15). With the exception of herpes zoster, other AESIs demonstrated a similar risk with UPA versus ADA. Conclusion: In patients with active RA despite MTX use, UPA demonstrated an incremental achievement of clinical outcomes compared to ADA together with a similar profile of AESIs with ADA (with the exception of herpes zoster)."

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the association between PROs and composite outcomes in RA patients receiving the JAK1- selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (UPA), with prior inadequate responses (IR) to conventional synthetic (cs) or biologic (b) DMARD(s). Methods: data were analyzed from two 12-week (wk), phase 3, RCTs in csDMARD-IR (SELECT-NEXT) and bDMARDIR (SELECT-BEYOND) patients receiving UPA 15 or 30 mg daily (QD) or placebo and background csDMARD therapy; as well as from a third trial (SELECT-MONOTHERAPY), in which MTX-IR patients received UPA monotherapy or MTX (blinded) for 14 wks. Moderate and substantial improvements in pain (‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢30% and ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢50% improvement from baseline [D BL], respectively), and normative values in HAQ-DI (‚Äö√¢¬ß0.25) and functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue (FACIT-F: ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢43.6, SELECT-NEXT only) were evaluated. Associations between clinical outcomes (total and swollen joint counts [TJC, SJC], physician global assessment [MDGA], CRP and composite measures [ACR, DAS28-CRP, CDAI]), and PROs (pain [VAS], HAQ-DI, patient global assessment [PtGA], morning stiffness, FACIT-F) were evaluated through Pearson correlations and a univariate logistic model, controlling for treatment group and BL value. Results: patients enrolled in the SELECT-NEXT and SELECT-BEYOND trials had moderate to severely active RA (mean DAS28-CRP: 5.6 and 5.8, respectively), with disease durations of 7 and 12 years, respectively. In general, DBL in pain and HAQ-DI scores were marginally correlated with individual physician-derived measures (SELECT-NEXT: pain, 0.161-0.537, HAQ-DI, 0.081-0.425; SELECT-BEYOND: pain, 0.131-0.511, HAQ-DI, 0.052-0.409); moreover, moderate to high correlations were observed between pain, HAQ-DI and PtGA in both RCTs (SELECT-NEXT: pain, 0.835-0.851, HAQ-DI, 0.418-0.518; SELECT-BEYOND: pain, 0.828-0.871, HAQ-DI, 0.479-0.520). In regression analyses, improvements in individual disease assessments were associated with significant improvements in pain at Wk12 across RCTs (Table). In addition, patients with improvement in composite measures were more likely to report substantial improvements in pain. Similar associations were evident for HAQ-DI scores at Wk12 across RCTs (including SELECT-MONOTHERAPY), as well as for FACIT-F in SELECT-NEXT. Conclusion: achieving substantial improvements in pain, physical function, and fatigue was associated both with individual physician-derived measures and with composite disease outcomes. These data support the use of PROs in RCTs and also imply that, although PROs may be included in composite endpoints, they are distinct parameters that provide additional insights into the true impact of RA"

Adult patients with RA (ACR/EULAR 2010) receiving MTX (orally or by injection) for at least 3 months were allocated to AI or PFS for 6 months and then were allocated to AI for 6 further months. Two co-primary endpoints were defined at M6: percentage of patients with compliance at least 80%; change in functional capacity assessed by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Secondary endpoints included quality of life (RaQoL), RA activity (DAS28), and acceptability. Local safety at injection site was assessed at each visit., RESULTS: Two-hundred and sixty-five patients were randomized. The main analysis was conducted on per protocol set (99 AI and 98 PFS). Compliance was 96.2% in AI and 98.9% in PFS. Good complier rates were 89.9% and 94.9%, thus a difference of - 5.0% (- 18.9%; 8.9%). HAQ remained stable in both groups. No difference was found on RaQoL, change in RA activity, and safety profile. Autonomy, acceptability, and patient satisfaction were better with AI, and patients having had the experience of both AI and PFS preferred AI (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Although this study did not demonstrate non-inferiority of AI versus PFS, compliance was excellent in the two groups, and AI, which was preferred by patients, is a valuable alternative to PFS for administration of MTX., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02553018., FUNDING: Nordic Pharma SAS."

Patients with active rheumatic arthritis treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate (Group A) were compared with patients treated with methotrexate alone (Group B).
 Group A
 Group A patients received rituximab 1000 mg intravenously (IV) on Days 3 and 17 of the 36 week treatment period.
 At Day 1 and at Week 24, patients received an intradermal injection of 0.1 mL of C. albicans on the volar surface of the forearm. Forty-eight to 72 hours after each injection, patients were evaluated for a delayed-type hypersensitivity response by measuring the diameter of induration (palpable raised, hardened area of the forearm skin).
 At Week 24, patients received a tetanus toxoid adsorbed booster vaccine (1 mg in 0.5 mL) intramuscular (IM) injection in the deltoid muscle. Serum levels of tetanus toxoid titers were obtained at Day 3 immediately prior to the first administration of rituximab, and immediately prior to and 4 weeks after administration of the tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine.
 At Week 28, patients received an IM injection of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (0.5 mL) in the deltoid muscle. Serum levels for antibodies to 12 pneumococcal serotypes were measured at Day 3 immediately prior to the first administration of rituximab, and immediately prior to and 4 weeks after administration of the pneumococcal vaccine.
 At Weeks 32 and 33, patients received subcutaneous (SC) keyhole limpet hemocyanin 1 mg. Serum anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin antibody levels were measured at Day 3 immediately prior to the first administration of rituximab, and immediately prior to and 4 weeks after the first administration of keyhole limpet hemocyanin.
 Samples were obtained for the determination of serum rituximab concentration (pharmacokinetics), peripheral blood CD19 counts (pharmacodynamics), and the presence of human anti‚Äö√†√≠chimeric antibodies from all patients in Group A.
 Group A patients completed the treatment period at Week 36 and, if qualified, had the option of entering the optional extension re-treatment period. Patients who did not qualify for or who did not choose to receive the optional extension re-treatment entered the approximately 1-year safety follow-up period. After the safety follow-up period, patients who remained peripherally CD19-positive B-cell depleted entered the B-cell follow-up period where they were followed every 12 weeks until their peripheral CD19-positive B cells returned to baseline values or the lower limit of normal, whichever was lower.
 Group B
 Because the immune response to vaccines was not likely to be influenced by the knowledge of treatment assignment or the time-of-year administration, vaccinations of Group B patients were administered sooner than in the Group A 36 week treatment period.
 At Day 1 and at Week 12, patients received an intradermal injection of 0.1 mL of C. albicans on the volar surface of the forearm. Forty-eight to 72 hours after each injection, patients were evaluated for a delayed-type hypersensitivity response by measuring the diameter of induration (palpable raised, hardened area of the forearm skin).
 On Day 1, patients received a tetanus toxoid adsorbed booster vaccine (1 mg in 0.5 mL) IM injection in the deltoid muscle. Serum levels of tetanus toxoid titers were obtained immediately prior to and 4 weeks after administration of the tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine.
 At Week 4, patients received an IM injection of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (0.5 mL) in the deltoid muscle. Serum levels for antibodies to 12 pneumococcal serotypes were measured at Day 1, and immediately prior to and 4 weeks after administration of the pneumococcal vaccine.
 At Weeks 8 and 9, patients received SC keyhole limpet hemocyanin 1 mg. Serum anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin antibody levels were measured at Day 1, and immediately prior to and 4 weeks after the first administration of keyhole limpet hemocyanin.
 Upon completion of the Week 12 visit, Group B patients with active rheumatic arthritis, defined as a swollen joint count (SJC) ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 4 (66 joint count) and a tender joint count (TJC) ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 6 (68 joint count) were eligible for treatment with 2 infusions of rituximab 1000 mg IV, 14 days apart. Patients received the first infusion of rituximab within 2 weeks after completing the Week 12 visit and after the second C. albicans skin test had been read. Patients received methylprednisolone 100 mg IV before each infusion of rituximab.
 Group B patients who received treatment with rituximab completed the treatment period through Week 36 and, if qualified, had the option of entering the optional extension re-treatment period. Patients who did not qualify for or who did not choose to receive the optional extension re-treatment entered the approximately 1-year safety follow-up period.

Seventy-five patients, aged 33 to 68 years, took part in the investigation. Sixty patients who did not respond to NSAIDs and at least to one DMARD entered the 1-year controlled trial and were randomly allocated to three groups (20 patients in each). Group 1 received azathioprine (150 mg/day as an initial dose); Group 2 received methotrexate (7.5 mg/week); Group 3 received Csn A (2.5 mg /kg/day). Sixteen patients withdrew from the study for adverse effects (9 on azathioprine; 5 on methotrexate; 2 on Csn A) and 2 for lack of efficacy (on Csn A). Forty-two patients completed the trial. Results showed comparable positive changes in all groups. All 11 patients clearly improved on azathioprine, 12 out of 15 on methotrexate and 14 out of 16 on Csn A. Csn A was also administered to 15 patients who had previously been resistant to all DMARDs including immunodepressants. In this group, treatment was stopped in 5 patients for adverse reactions and in 3 for inefficacy. The evident clinical improvement was observed in 5 out of 7 patients who completed the 1-year trial. Csn A is an effective DMARD, comparable with azathioprine and methotrexate. It may be of benefit in the therapy of some recalcitrant RA cases refractory to all other DMARDs.

In a six month open trial, we compared cyclosporine (2.5 to 5 mg/kg of body weight) and methotrexate at 15-30 mg/ Week (at the maximal tolerated dose) in 100 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had residual inflammation and disability despite partial response to other SAARD's. The primary outcome measure was the change in the number of tender joints, swollen joints, global assessment by physician and patient himself, pain and degree of disability. In both the treatment groups, there was equal improvement in both the regimens in about 60% of patients (observed difference was less than 2 SE/at 6 months of therapy and beyond one year also. The adverse effect i.e. thrombocytopenia, mouth ulcers, renal insufficiency and injury were high in both the groups. About 60% of patients improved on both the regimens showing equal efficacy (Z <1.96) but side effects were more in methotrexate group. Though we can use immunosuppressive drugs early in refractory rheumatoid arthritis but their side effect must be monitored carefully and long term follow up of patients treated with this therapy is needed."

A total of 17 034 serum concentrations were analyzed from 1991 rheumatoid arthritis patients who received subcutaneous administration of sirukumab 50 mg every 4 weeks or 100 mg every 2 weeks. A stepwise confirmatory population PK analysis was conducted to accommodate the staged data release and the sparse sampling nature of phase 3 studies and to assess the potential covariate influences in an unbiased and timely manner. The base model, that is, a 1-compartment linear model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination, was prespecified based on prior information from a phase 2 study along with information about phase 3 study design. The covariate model was also prespecified based on pharmacological/physiological relevance and sample size. After the primary covariate analysis, a simplified model was produced by removing covariates with effect sizes <10%. The estimated apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution were 0.641 L/day and 16.1 L, respectively, at standard body weights of 70 kg. The terminal elimination half-life was approximately 17.4 days. Sirukumab CL/F and volume of distribution increased with body weight, and CL/F was higher in patients with diabetic comorbidity. Simulations suggest that the effects of diabetic comorbidity and weight on sirukumab exposure were additive. To fully understand the clinical relevance including potential dose adjustment, current covariate findings need to be evaluated concurrently with the efficacy and safety data.

9257716,,10.33590/emjrheumatol/10314940,"Background/Purpose: baseline differences in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease characteristics and molecular profile across populations may be a reflection of genetic variations and environmental factors such as regional differences in treatment paradigm, access to biologics, diet and lifestyle. These differences may influence response to treatment. The objective of this study was to compare baseline and post treatment molecular profiles of RA patients across geographic regions that were inadequate responders (IR) to conventional DMARDs and anti-TNFs and were treated with sirukumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds IL6. Methods: serum samples were taken at baseline, Week 4, and Week 24 in two phase 3 studies of sirukumab in RA: sIRROUND-D (DMARD-IR), and SIRROUND -T (anti-TNF-IR). Results are reported (from SIRROUND -D -T) for patients from Asia-Pacific (AP), Europe (EU), and North America(NA), respectively, in the following dose groups: sirukumab 100mg q2w (n=49 33, 98 36, 24 67) and sirukumab 50mg q4w (n=40 21, 103 40, 25 67). Serum was analyzed using the SomaLogic SOMAscanTM platform (376 analytes). Analytes significantly and differentially expressed in baseline RA samples versus independently collected demographically-matched healthy control serum samples were used to derive a serum composite score for each sample set via a log2-transformation of the median of normalized values for the analytes. mRNA from whole blood samples was isolated and profiled using the Affymetrix HT HG-U133+ PM Array. Gene set variation analysis was used to evaluate enrichment of an in vitro derived IL-6 gene signature in each sample and compared across geographic regions. Results: the following analytes, elevated in baseline serum samples from RA patients versus healthy controls, formed the basis of the serum composite score: annexin I, BLC/CXCL13, BPI, CRP, IL6, IP-10/CXCL10, LEAP1/hepcidin, MMP1, MMP3, PBEF, PHI, SAA, SP-D, TIMP-3. At baseline, the serum composite score, as well as individual RA-associated analytes, such as CXCL13, MMP3, and SP-D, were significantly elevated in patients from AP compared with EU or NA. Patients from AP also showed higher enrichment for the in vitro-derived IL-6 gene expression signature at baseline. After 4 and 24 weeks of treatment, the serum composite score and IL-6 gene signature was significantly decreased in all patients from both sirukumab treatment arms compared with placebo. However, stronger pharmacodynamic effects and significantly greater down regulation of both the serum composite score and IL-6 gene signature were observed in AP patients at both 4 and 24 weeks post treatment. These molecular changes were associated with higher baseline RA disease severity and CRP levels observed in patients from the AP region. Conclusion: rA-related inflammatory proteins and the IL-6 gene signature are significantly elevated at baseline and more extensively down-regulated post sirukumab treatment in both DMARD-IR and TNFi-IR patients from the AP region compared with the rest of world.

9260658,,10.3899/jrheum.100756,"OBJECTIVE: To identify disease activity, smoking, and reproductive-related predictors of a poor prognosis in patients with very early inflammatory polyarthritis (IP).
METHODS: Patients with very early IP (symptom duration 4-11 weeks) included in our study were participants in the STIVEA (Steroids In Very Early Arthritis) randomized placebo-controlled trial. At baseline, disease-related variables were measured and patients were asked to complete a questionnaire covering smoking status and reproductive questions. Baseline predictors of poor prognosis [i.e., the need to start disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy by 6 months or the clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at 12 months] were identified, applying logistic regression analyses adjusted for treatment group.
RESULTS: Rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity was one of the strongest clinical predictors of a poor prognosis: OR for DMARD therapy at 6 months, 4.00 (95% CI 2.00-8.00) and OR for a diagnosis of RA at 12 months, 9.48 (95% CI 4.48-20.07). There was a significant association between current smoking at baseline compared to never smoking and a diagnosis of RA at 12 months (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.16-8.56).
CONCLUSION: About 6 in 7 patients with very early RF-positive IP were diagnosed with RA 1 year later. In addition, 1 in 4 IP patients who smoke will develop RA later. It is recommended to treat RF-positive patients who have IP with DMARD at presentation and to advise patients to stop smoking."

METHODS: Adult patients taking methotrexate with a previous inadequate response to > or = 1 tumor necrosis factor inhibitor received 1 course of open-label rituximab (2 x 1000 mg IV) at baseline. From Week 24, patients were randomized to receive an additional course of retreatment with rituximab or placebo. Efficacy responses at Week 48 relative to baseline were assessed._x000D_
RESULTS: Of 559 patients who received the open-label first course of rituximab, 475 patients were randomized to a second course (rituximab retreatment: n = 318, placebo retreatment: n = 157). Relative to baseline, patients who took rituximab during retreatment had significantly improved efficacy at Week 48 compared to patients who took a placebo during retreatment [American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) criteria, 54% vs 45%, p = 0.02; change in Disease Activity Score-28 mean -1.9 vs -1.5, p = 0.006]. Differences in efficacy between groups were first observed following Weeks 28-32. Worsening of most components of the ACR core set occurred in the placebo-retreated patients with relative maintenance of these measures in rituximab-retreated patients. Randomized patients who had achieved week 24 ACR responses following the first course had greater odds of losing response if retreated with placebo (odds ratios for ACR20, ACR50, ACR70: 2.09, 2.03, and 4.09, respectively). Following retreatment, the proportion of patients experiencing any adverse events (AE), serious AE, infections, and serious infections were comparable between the rituximab and placebo retreatment groups._x000D_

METHODS: from the total SWEFOT trial population, 159 patients had hand radiographs correctly timed and taken with same modality to BE analyzed with DXR. All patients started treatment with methotrexate. After 3-4‚Äö√Ñ√¢months, patients with DAS28‚Äö√Ñ√¢>‚Äö√Ñ√¢3.2 were randomized to add sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy) or infliximab (MTX‚Äö√Ñ√¢+‚Äö√Ñ√¢INF).

Methods: In the SWEFOT trial, 487 patients (symptom duration <12 months) started methotrexate (MTX) 20 mg/week. After 3-4 months, patients with DAS28>3.2 were randomized to either sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (""triple therapy"") or infliximab (""anti-TNF""). Those with DAS28 <=3.2 were followed in regular care (""MTX-responders""). Radiographic progression over 24 months was scored according to the van der Heijde modified Sharp score (SvdH). Metacarpal bone loss from 0-12 months was measured by DXR (Sectra, Linkoping, Sweden), a method developed to allow measurement using routinely obtained digital x-rays. DXR bone loss >2.5 mg/cm2/month (10x upper limit of normal) is considered highly elevated and was used as cut-off in this study. Results: Out of the whole SWEFOT population (n=487), the X-rays from 159 patients were of sufficient quality and correctly timed to be analyzed with the DXR method: MTX-responders 49 (31.0%), triple therapy 55 (34.5%), and anti-TNF 55 (34.5%). The proportions of patients with DXR-change rate >= 2.5 mg/cm2/month in MTX responders, triple therapy, and anti-TNF were 4.1%, 22.2% and 16.4%, respectively (p=0.01). Mean (SEM) radiological progression over 24 months according to SvdH-score was 6.72 (1.01), 7.40 (2.01) and 4.55 (0.66) for MTX monotherapy, triple therapy and anti-TNF, respectively (p=0.06 between triple therapy and anti-TNF). Mean (SEM) radiological progression over 24 months in patients who did and who did not have a highly elevated DXR-change rate during the first 12 months was 10.38 (4.60) and 3.86 (0.58), respectively (p=0.006), and a significant difference was also seen for progression in the erosion score, 3.81 (1.98) vs. 1.23 (0.32) (p=0.02). Patients with highly elevated DXR change rate during the first 12 months had statistically significantly greater risk for a >=5 increase in SvdH after 24 months (odds ratio 3.09, 95% CI =1.20-7.79, p=0.02). More progression occurred in the triple therapy group. (odds ratio 4.15, 95% CI=1.05-16.35, p=0.04). Conclusion: DXR provides information on metacarpal bone loss in patients with RA. Non-responders to MTX (who went on to randomization in this trial) had a significantly greater risk for highly elevated BMD loss than MTX-responders despite the add-on therapies; and patients with highly elevated metacarpal bone loss had significantly greater x-ray damage after 24 months. Information from DXR may be complementary to that obtained by clinical assessments and standard radiography."

Patients suffer considerable pain, stiffness and swelling and can sustain various degrees of joint destruction, deformity, and significant functional decline. In addition, the economic burden due to hospitalisation and loss of employment is considerable, with over 50% of patients being work-disabled within 10¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†years of diagnosis. Despite several biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD) now available, there is a lack of data to guide biologic sequencing. In the UK, second-line biologic treatment is restricted to a single option, rituximab. The aim of the SWITCH trial is to establish whether an alternative-mechanism-TNF-inhibitor (TNFi) or abatacept are as effective as rituximab in patients with RA who have failed an initial TNFi drug._x000D_
METHODS/DESIGN: SWITCH is a pragmatic, phase IV, multi-centre, parallel-group design, open-label, randomised, controlled trial (RCT) comparing alternative-mechanism-TNFi and abatacept with rituximab in patients with RA who have failed an initial TNFi drug. Participants are randomised in a 1: 1: 1 ratio to receive alternative mechanism TNFi, (monoclonal antibodies: infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab or golimumab or the receptor fusion protein, etanercept), abatacept or rituximab during the interventional phase (from randomisation up to week 48). Participants are subsequently followed up to a maximum of 96¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†weeks, which constitutes the observational phase. The primary objective is to establish whether an alternative-mechanism-TNFi or abatacept are non-inferior to rituximab in terms of disease response at 24¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†weeks post randomisation. The secondary objectives include the comparison of alternative-mechanism-TNFi and abatacept to rituximab in terms of disease response, quality of life, toxicity, safety and structural and bone density outcomes over a 12-month period (48¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†weeks) and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of switching patients to alternative active therapies compared to current practice._x000D_
DISCUSSION: SWITCH is a well-designed trial in this therapeutic area that aims to develop a rational treatment algorithm to potentially inform personalised treatment regimens (as opposed to switching all patients to only one available (and possibly unsuccessful) therapy), which may lead to long-term improved patient outcomes and gains in population health._x000D_

Design: multicentre, Phase III, open-label, parallel-group, three-arm, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of alternative TNFi and abatacept with that of rituximab (and background MTX therapy). Eligible consenting patients were randomised in a 1: 1: 1 ratio using minimisation incorporating a random element. Minimisation factors were centre, disease duration, non-response category and seropositive/seronegative status. Setting: UK outpatient rheumatology departments. Participants: patients aged >= 18 years who were diagnosed with RA and were receiving MTX, but had not responded to two or more conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapies and had shown an inadequate treatment response to a first TNFi. Interventions: alternative TNFi, abatacept or rituximab (and continued background MTX). Main outcome measures: the primary outcome was absolute reduction in the Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28) at 24 weeks post randomisation. Secondary outcome measures over 48 weeks were additional measures of disease activity, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, radiographic measures, safety and toxicity. Limitations: owing to third-party contractual issues, commissioning challenges delaying centre set-up and thus slower than expected recruitment, the funders terminated the trial early. Results: between July 2012 and December 2014, 149 patients in 35 centres were registered, of whom 122 were randomised to treatment (alternative TNFi, n = 41; abatacept, n = 41; rituximab, n = 40). The numbers, as specified, were analysed in each group [in line with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle]. Comparing alternative TNFi with rituximab, the difference in mean reduction in DAS28 at 24 weeks post randomisation was 0.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to 1.05] in the ITT patient population and -0.58 (95% CI -1.72 to 0.55) in the per protocol (PP) population. Corresponding results for the abatacept and rituximab comparison were 0.04 (95% CI -0.72 to 0.79) in the ITT population and -0.15 (95% CI -1.27 to 0.98) in the PP population. General improvement in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life and the patients' general health was apparent over time, with no notable differences between treatment groups. There was a marked initial improvement in the patients' global assessment of pain and arthritis at 12 weeks across all three treatment groups. Switching to alternative TNFi may be cost-effective compared with rituximab [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 5332.02 per qualityadjusted life-year gained]; however, switching to abatacept compared with switching to alternative TNFi is unlikely to be cost-effective (ICER 253,967.96), but there was substantial uncertainty in the decisions.

Methods: in this subset analysis of the Treat-to-Target trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01981473), 53 adult patients with moderate-to-severe RA nonresponsive to methotrexate were treated with 50 mg ETN/week for 24 weeks (Period 1). Patients achieving LDA were randomized to continue ETN treatment or switched to PBO for an additional 28 weeks (Period 2). The proportion of patients maintaining LDA or remission in each arm at the end of Period 2 was determined. Additional efficacy and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were also evaluated. Results: during Period 1, 51 patients achieved LDA according to the disease activity score-28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR LDA) and 30 achieved remission. At week 52, nine of 22 and eight of 29 in the ETN and PBO groups, respectively, remained in DAS28-ESR LDA without experiencing a flare. Additionally, six of 14 and five of 16 in the ETN and PBO groups, respectively, remained in remission. Among patients experiencing a flare during Period 2, 13 of 22 and 21 of 29 received ETN or PBO, respectively. The median time to flare was 193 and 87 days in the ETN and PBO groups, respectively. At week 52, consistently more patients in the ETN group than in the PBO group achieved predetermined efficacy and PRO endpoints. Conclusions: these data suggest continuing ETN maintenance therapy is beneficial to patients after they have achieved their treatment target.

Compared with PBO, greater proportions of etn-treated patients were in LDA (21/32 [65.6%] vs. 3/29 [10.3%], respectively; p < 0.001), or remission (11/13 [84.6%] vs. 3/11 [27.3%], p = 0.005), or achieved ACR50 (22/30 [73.3%] vs. 14/29 [48.3%], p = 0.051), or HAQ-DI <0.5 (23/32 [71.9%] vs. 15/29 [51.7%], p = 0.113) at week 52. In the overall population, safety profiles were similar for the ETN and PBO groups. Conclusions: in this subset analysis of asian RA patients, treatment with ETN provided a higher probability to maintain LDA and remission than treatment with PBO"

Patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy received open-label etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously once weekly plus methotrexate with or without other conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs for 24 weeks. Patients achieving LDA [disease activity score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) <3.2] at week 24 were randomized to receive etanercept-methotrexate combination therapy or placebo-methotrexate combination therapy, with or without other csDMARDs, for 28 weeks. In the open-label period, 72% of patients achieved DAS28-ESR LDA at week 24. Patients enrolled in the double-blind period had long-standing rheumatoid arthritis and high disease activity at baseline (mean duration, 8.1 years; DAS28-ESR, 6.4). In the etanercept and placebo combination groups, 44% versus 17% achieved DAS28-ESR LDA and 34 versus 13% achieved DAS28-ESR remission at week 52 (p < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 37 and 43%, serious adverse events in 0 and 4%, and serious infections in 0 and 2% in these groups, respectively, in the double-blind period. After induction of response with etanercept combination therapy following a treat-to-target approach in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis and high disease activity at baseline, the etanercept combination regimen was significantly more effective in maintaining LDA and remission than a biologic-free regimen.

Methods: in this subset analysis of patients from Latin America enrolled in NCT01981473, adult patients with active RA nonresponsive to prior MTX (>10 mg/week for >12 weeks) were treated with ETN50 + MTX +/- other nbDMARDs for 24 weeks (open-label, Period 1 [P1]). Patients achieving LDA (DAS28-ESR <3.2) at week 24 were randomized and treated with ETN50 + MTX +/- other nbDMARDs or PBO + MTX +/- nbDMARDs for 28 weeks (Period 2 [P2]).

Methods: in this subset analysis of the Treat-to-Target trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01981473), 53 adult patients with moderate-to-severe RA nonresponsive to methotrexate were treated with 50 mg ETN/week for 24 weeks (Period 1). Patients achieving LDA were randomized to continue ETN treatment or switched to PBO for an additional 28 weeks (Period 2). The proportion of patients maintaining LDA or remission in each arm at the end of Period 2 was determined. Additional efficacy and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were also evaluated. Results: during Period 1, 51 patients achieved LDA according to the disease activity score-28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR LDA) and 30 achieved remission. At week 52, nine of 22 and eight of 29 in the ETN and PBO groups, respectively, remained in DAS28-ESR LDA without experiencing a flare. Additionally, six of 14 and five of 16 in the ETN and PBO groups, respectively, remained in remission. Among patients experiencing a flare during Period 2, 13 of 22 and 21 of 29 received ETN or PBO, respectively. The median time to flare was 193 and 87 days in the ETN and PBO groups, respectively. At week 52, consistently more patients in the ETN group than in the PBO group achieved predetermined efficacy and PRO endpoints.

9257026,,10.1136/bmj.h1046,"Background: In early RA three head-to-head trials (H2H) show similar outcomes with conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs) and tumour-necrosis- factor inhibitor (TNFi). No existing H2H trials have compared these two strategies in established active RA. We tested the hypothesis that initial cDMARD and TNFi treatment strategies give equivalent reductions in health assessment questionnaire scores (HAQ) in RA patients meeting NICE criteria to receive TNFi in a 12-month H2H trial. Methods: A multicentre randomized observer-blind trial compared initial treatment strategies with TNFi and cDMARDs. 6-month nonresponders received 2nd TNFi (initial TNFi) or 1st TNFi (initial cDMARDs). HAQ was the primary outcome. DAS, Larsen scores (X-rays), quality of life (SF-36), health utility (EQ5D) and adverse events were secondary outcomes. Groups were compared by linear regression (corrected for demographic and baseline variables) in an intention to treat analyses (ITT) with multiple imputations for missing data. We also undertook a completer analysis. Results: 205 patients (median RA duration >4 years) received TNFis (101) or cDMARDs (104). 147 (72%) completed 12 months: 75 had initial TNFi and 72 cDMARDs (38 took cDMARDs for 12 months). ITT analyses (Table 1) showed at 12 months HAQ improved more with the cDMARD strategy; SF-36 (data not shown), EQ5D, Larsen scores and DAS showed equivalent changes. At 6 months HAQ, SF-36, EQ5D and Larsen scores showed equivalent changes: DAS improved more with TNFis, with differences seen by 1 month. Falls in ESR drove these rapid DAS changes. Completer analyses showed similar results (data not shown). Remissions (DAS<2.6) were equivalent and low with TNFi and cDMARD strategies at 6 (14% and 8%) and 12 months (22% and 14%). 7% starting TNFis and 9% cDMARDs withdrew for toxicity. Conclusions: TACIT confirmed our hypothesis that cDMARDs and TNFis are equivalent in active established RA. cDMARDs cost less than TNFis and similarly improved health utility (EQ5D) with 38% patients remaining on DMARDs for 12 months. Disability and X-ray damage did not worsen in 6-month cDMARD non-responders who then received TNFis. Initial TNFis rapidly reduced ESRs without added benefits on disability or X-ray damage. As <22% achieved 12 month DAS remissions in both groups neither strategy was ideal. Treating active established RA should move beyond current NICE guidance; patients need more diverse and more intensive therapies. (Table presented)."

Active RA patients who fail such treatments can receive tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), which are effective but expensive.
OBJECTIVE: we assessed whether or not combination DMARDs (cDMARDs) give equivalent clinical benefits at lower costs in RA patients eligible for TNFis.
DESIGN: an open-label, 12-month, pragmatic, randomised, multicentre, two-arm trial [Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors Against Combination Intensive Therapy (TACIT)] compared these treatment strategies. We then systematically reviewed all comparable published trials.
SETTING: the TACIT trial involved 24 English rheumatology clinics.
PARTICIPANTS: active RA patients eligible for TNFis.
INTERVENTIONS: the TACIT trial compared cDMARDs with TNFis plus methotrexate or another DMARD; 6-month non-responders received (a) TNFis if in the cDMARD group; and (b) a second TNFi if in the TNFi group.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was the primary outcome measure. The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), joint damage, Disease Activity Score for 28 Joints (DAS28), withdrawals and adverse effects were secondary outcome measures. Economic evaluation linked costs, HAQ changes and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: in total, 432 patients were screened; 104 started on cDMARDs and 101 started on TNFis. The initial demographic and disease assessments were similar between the groups. In total, 16 patients were lost to follow-up (nine in the cDMARD group, seven in the TNFi group) and 42 discontinued their intervention but were followed up (23 in the cDMARD group and 19 in the TNFi group). Intention-to-treat analysis with multiple imputation methods used for missing data showed greater 12-month HAQ score reductions with initial cDMARDs than with initial TNFis [adjusted linear regression coefficient 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.003 to 0.31; p‚Äö√Ñ√¢=‚Äö√Ñ√¢0.046].

DESIGN: open label pragmatic randomised multicentre two arm non-inferiority trial over 12 months.
SETTING: 24 rheumatology clinics in England.
PARTICIPANTS: patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were eligible for treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors according to current English guidance were randomised to either the tumour necrosis factor inhibitor strategy or the combined disease modifying drug strategy.
INTERVENTIONS: biologic strategy: start tumour necrosis factor inhibitor; second biologic in six month for non-responders. Alternative strategy: start combination of disease modifying drugs; start tumour necrosis factor inhibitors after six months in non-responders.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: PRIMARY OUTCOME: reduction in disability at 12 months measured with patient recorded heath assessment questionnaire (range 0.00-3.00) with a 0.22 non-inferiority margin for combination treatment versus the biologic strategy.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: quality of life, joint damage, disease activity, adverse events, and costs. Intention to treat analysis used multiple imputation methods for missing data.
RESULTS: 432 patients were screened: 107 were randomised to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and 101 started taking; 107 were randomised to the combined drug strategy and 104 started taking the drugs. Initial assessments were similar; 16 patients were lost to follow-up (seven with the tumour necrosis factor inhibitor strategy, nine with the combined drug strategy); 42 discontinued the intervention but were followed-up (19 and 23, respectively). The primary outcome showed mean falls in scores on the health assessment questionnaire of -0.30 with the tumour necrosis factor inhibitor strategy and -0.45 with the alternative combined drug strategy. The difference between groups in unadjusted linear regression analysis favoured the alternative strategy of combined drugs. The mean difference was -0.14, and the 95% confidence interval (-0.29 to 0.01) was below the prespecified non-inferiority boundary of 0.22. Improvements at 12 months in secondary outcomes, including quality of life and erosive progression, were similar with both strategies. Initial reductions in disease activity were greater with the biologic strategy, but these differences did not persist beyond six months. Remission was seen in 72 patients (44 with biologic strategy; 36 with alternative strategy); 28 patients had serious adverse events (18 and 10, respectively); six and 10 patients, respectively, stopped treatment because of toxicity. The alternative strategy reduced health and social care costs per patient by ¬¨¬£3615 (‚Äö√á¬®4930, $5585) for months 0-6 and ¬¨¬£1930 for months 6-12.
CONCLUSIONS: in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who meet English criteria for biologics an alternative strategy with combinations of intensive synthetic disease modifying drugs gives non-inferior outcomes to treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors.

Description of Methods and Materials: Japanese RA subjects (N=194) were randomized to 1 of 3 dosing arms: intravenous infused abatacept 2 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or placebo; all on a background of methotrexate. Subjects received doses of abatacept or placebo at visits on Days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113 and 141. Trough PK samples were taken at each pre-dose and ACR20 response was assessed on each visit. Abatacept E-R was characterized by a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) logistic regression model, with time-varying actual trough concentration and ACR20 responder rates over the 6 months treatment period. Data and Results: The model was developed by examination of log-likelihood scores, and the cumulative logit in the final model was specified by log-transformed trough concentration, categorical time effect, categorical group effect, and time by group interaction. The categorical group effect included the placebo effect, and the trough concentration term solely describes the drug-effect. Interpretation, Conclusion or Significance: Considering that ACR20 is a binary variable and there is a delay in observing a response in RA treatment, the GEE model was useful for the prediction of the probability of ACR20 response in the presence of missing data. The predicted ACR20 responder rate was consistent with the actual values in the clinical study. In conclusion, abatacept trough concentration is a good predictor of ACR20 response."
9260805,,10.3899/jrheum.120541,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) with infliximab (IFX) compared with MTX alone in the prevention of atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: A randomized, open-label study in which early RA patients with active disease were treated with MTX alone (n = 20) and MTX plus IFX (n = 20) for 6 months. Patients were assessed every 3 months. Patients from the MTX-alone group who failed to achieve 28-joint Disease Activity Score remission (DAS28 ‚Äö√¢¬ß 2.6) at 6 months were permitted to escape to open-label IFX. Intima-media thickness (IMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and augmentation index (AIx) were measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.
RESULTS: At 6 months, there was a significantly greater reduction in PWV in the MTX-alone group (0.18 ¬¨¬± 1.59 m/s) compared with the MTX plus IFX group (-0.78 ¬¨¬± 1.13 m/s; p = 0.044), accompanied by significantly greater reduction in patient's global assessment, number of swollen joints, C-reactive protein, and DAS28 in the MTX plus IFX group compared to the MTX-alone group. The changes in IMT and AIx were similar between the 2 groups. At 12 months, there was a trend favoring early combination treatment with regard to the reduction in PWV (p = 0.06).
CONCLUSION: MTX plus IFX causes a more significant reduction in PWV than MTX alone in patients with early RA after 6-month treatment, and further improvement may be achieved in patients who continued on longterm tumor necrosis factor-≈í¬± blockers, suggesting that early, effective suppression of inflammation may prevent progression of atherosclerosis by improving vascular function."
9736562,,10.3899/jrheum.120541,"Background/Purpose: Chronic inflammation is probably a driving force for premature atherosclerosis in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Whether effective suppression of inflammation could prevent progression of atherosclerosis would be worth studying. This study aimed to ascertain the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) with infliximab compared with MTX alone in the prevention of atherosclerosis in patients with early RA. Methods: A randomized, open-labeled study in which early RA patients (symptom onset < 2 years) with moderate to severe disease severity were treated with MTX with (Group 1, n=20) and without (Group 2, n=20) infliximab according to a standard treatment protocol for 12 months. Patients were assessed every 3 month. The main goal of treatment was to achieve remission (Disease activity score in 28 joints [DAS28] 2.6). Therapeutic regime was adjusted at each visit if the patient failed to achieve remission within 3 months according to the protocol. Progression of subclinical atherosclerosis will be measured by carotid ultrasound and arterial stiffness indexes as determined by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) at baseline and 12 months. Results: Baseline clinical, demographic, cardiovascular risk factors and vascular assessment parameters (intima-media thickness [IMT], PWV and AIx) were similar between the 2 groups except Group 1 had a higher DAS28 score. At months 12, there was a significant decrease in PWV in Group 1 compared to baseline (15.3 +/- 2.3 m/s versus 14.5 +/- 2.6 m/s, p<0.05), while no significant changes were observed in Group 2 (14.6 +/- 2.5 m/s versus 14.9 +/- 3.2 m/s, p=0.341). Other vascular assessment parameters including the mean and maximum IMT and AIx remain unchanged in both groups. A higher proportion of patients in Group 1 achieved remission compared to Group 2 (4/20 [20%] versus 10/20 [50%], p<0.05). Most of the clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activities improved significantly in both groups compared to baseline, but there were no significant differences between the 2 groups at month 12. At month 12, the lipid profile was similar between the 2 groups although the fasting sugar level was significantly higher in Group 2 (4.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/L 5.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, p<0.05). Compared with baseline, the total cholesterol increased significantly in both groups and patients in Group 2 also had significant increase in LDL-cholesterol level. Fasting sugar and other lipid profile remained unchanged in both groups. Conclusion: PWV, a marker of arterial stiffness, improved significantly in patients with early RA after 12-month treatment with MTX plus infliximab, compared to MTX alone, suggesting that effective suppression of inflammation using TNF-a inhibitors may prevent progression of atherosclerosis by improving vascular function in patients with early RA."

To evaluate efficacy and safety, baricitinib [Janus kinase (JAK) 1/JAK2 inhibitor] was compared with placebo in Japanese patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite background treatment with methotrexate (MTX). Methods. This was a phase IIB, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01469013). Patients had moderate to severe active adult-onset RA despite stable treatment with MTX. Patients (n = 145) were randomized in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo or 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, or 8 mg oral baricitinib daily for 12 weeks. The primary analysis compared the combined 4/8-mg dose groups with placebo for the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response rate at 12 weeks. Other outcomes included additional measures of disease activity, physical function, laboratory abnormalities, and adverse events. Results. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the combined 4/8-mg baricitinib group (37/48, 77%) compared with the placebo group (15/49, 31%) had at least an ACR20 response after 12 weeks of treatment (p < 0.001). Significant improvements in disease activity, remission, and physical function were observed as early as Week 2 of treatment with baricitinib, particularly with daily doses of > 4 mg. Only 1 patient receiving baricitinib discontinued because of an adverse event. Adverse event rates with baricitinib doses < 4 mg daily were similar to placebo, but there was a higher incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities in the 8-mg group. Conclusion. In this phase II study, baricitinib was well tolerated and rapidly improved the signs, symptoms, and physical function of Japanese patients with active RA, supporting continued development of baricitinib (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01469013)."

For the doses currently being tested in Phase 3 RA studies (5 and 10 mg BID), the ratio of estimated proportions of responders (10 / 5 mg) ranged between 1.04-1.11 for ACR20, 1.17- 1.47 for ACR50, and 1.27-1.77 for ACR70 across the studies. Mean DAS28-3(CRP) scores at week 12 were estimated to be 0.2-0.5 points lower for 10 mg BID compared to 5 mg BID, with 5 and 10 mg BID providing 59% and 74% of the Emax, respectively. CONCLUSION: Tofacitinib demonstrated similar potency across multiple studies and endpoints. Greater relative benefits from 10 mg versus 5 mg BID were predicted, particularly in the more stringent efficacy measures (ACR70)."

Teaes and saes were more frequent in the sarilumab-treated groups. Laboratory findings were consistent with IL-6 blockade and observations from the MOBILITY study. From an RA patient perspective, fatigue, morning stiffness, pain, ability to participate in family/leisure activities, and work are important outcomes to assess treatment effectiveness. These analyses present the effects of sarilumab+dmard on the pre-defined secondary endpoints of fatigue, AM stiffness, pain, work within and outside the home and participation in family/leisure activities, and hrqol at week 24, AS well AS change in patient global assessment of disease activity (ptga) and physical function by health assessment questionnaire (HAQ). Methods: the intent-to-treat population included 546 patients randomized 1: 1: 1 to placebo, sarilumab 150 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or 200 mg q2w + background dmards. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) included functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue (FACIT-F), AM stiffness, pain VAS, work productivity survey (WPS), rheumatoid arthritis impact of disease (RAID), and short form-36 (SF-36) assessed at baseline, weeks 2 (FACIT, RAID, pain and AM stiffness only), 4, 12, and 24. PRO changes from baseline to week 24 were analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures using region, number of prior tnfis, visit, treatment, and treatment by visit interaction AS fixed effects and baseline PRO scores AS covariates. Results: baseline SF-36 physical (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores were >2 and >1 standard deviation below normative values, respectively, indicating significant disease burden. Statistically significant (p<0.025, simple bonferroni adjustment) improvements versus placebo+dmard in FACIT-F, AM stiffness, pain, WPS and RAID were reported by patients receiving sarilumab 150 mg+dmard and similarly for sarilumab 200 mg+dmard. SF-36 PCS significantly improved for both doses with no worsening of SF-36 MCS. Significant improvements were seen for 5/8 SF-36 domain scores for sarilumab 150mg + DMARD and 7/8 domain scores for sarilumab 200mg + DMARD. Ptga and HAQ, included in the primary analysis, were statistically significantly improved with both doses of sarilumab. With few exceptions, statistically significant improvements between sarilumab treatment groups and placebo exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for those pros with established mcids.

This study evaluated the effect of sarilumab on patient-perceived impact of RA using the 7-domain RA Impact of Disease (RAID) scale. METHODS: two phase III, randomized, controlled trials of sarilumab in patients with active, long-standing RA were analyzed: sarilumab 150 mg and 200 mg twice-weekly plus conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (+csDMARDs) versus placebo+csDMARDs [TARGET (NCT01709578)]; sarilumab 200 mg versus adalimumab 40 mg monotherapy (MONARCH [NCT02332590]). Least squares mean (LSM) differences in RAID total score (range 0-10), and 7 key RA symptoms, including pain and fatigue (baseline to weeks 12 and 24), were compared. 'Responders' by RAID total score were defined by improvements from baseline ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID), and ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) at end point. RESULTS: sarilumab 150 mg and 200 mg+csDMARDs were nominally superior (p<0.05) versus placebo+csDMARDs and 200 mg versus adalimumab 40 mg in LSM differences for RAID total score at weeks 12 (-0.93 and -1.13; -0.49, respectively) and 24 (-0.75 and -1.01; -0.78), and all impacts of RA (except functional impairment in MONARCH week 12).

METHODS: forty-six premenopausal women with early RA not previously treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or corticosteroid were randomized to 7.5 mg/week of methotrexate or 2 g/day of sulphasalazine for 18 months. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Biochemical studies included serum calcium, phosphorus, total alkaline phosphatase, beta-2 microglobulin, parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) concentrations, spot urinary calcium, and 24-h urinary calcium excretion. Disease activity was assessed by modified disease activity score (DAS 28), and functional impairment was estimated by the Health Assessment Questionnaire.

RESULTS: no significant difference in BMD of the lumbar spine, femur neck, or trochanter was observed at 18 months in either group. There was also no significant change in the biochemical parameters of both groups.

CONCLUSION: our findings suggest that low-dose methotrexate has no negative effect on BMD in premenopausal RA patients."

9260960,,10.3899/jrheum.120715,"OBJECTIVE: Rapidly predicting future outcomes based on short-term clinical response would be helpful to optimize rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management in early disease. Our aim was to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule to predict low disease activity (LDA) at 1 year among patients participating in the Treatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) trial escalating RA therapy by adding either etanercept or sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine [triple therapy (TT)] after 6 months of methotrexate (MTX) therapy.
METHODS: Eligible subjects included in the derivation cohort (used for model building, n = 186) were participants with moderate or higher disease activity [Disease Activity Score 28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS-ESR) > 3.2] despite 24 weeks of MTX monotherapy who added either etanercept or sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine. Clinical characteristics measured within the next 12 weeks were used to predict LDA 1 year later using multivariable logistic regression. Validation was performed in the cohort of TEAR patients randomized to initially receive either MTX + etanercept or TT.
RESULTS: The derivation cohort yielded 3 prediction models of varying complexity that included age, DAS28 at various timepoints, body mass index, and ESR (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve up to 0.83). Accuracy of the prediction models ranged between 80% and 95% in both derivation and validation cohorts, depending on the complexity of the model and the cutpoints chosen for response and nonresponse. About 80% of patients could be predicted to be responders or nonresponders at Week 12.
CONCLUSION: Clinical data collected early after starting or escalating disease-modifying antirheumatic drug/biologic treatment could accurately predict LDA at 1 year in patients with early RA. For patients predicted to be nonresponders, treatment could be changed at 12 weeks to optimize outcomes."

However, TNF antagonist therapy (and likely therapy with other biologics) reduce CRP levels, even without associated reductions in RA disease activity. Serum amyloid A (SAA) also models RA disease activity and has been suggested as a better biomarker for RA disease activity. We previously showed that TNF antagonist therapy lowered both SAA and CRP levels to a greater extent than oral disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) after adjusting for disease activity. However, TNF antagonists, compared to oral DMARDs, decreased CRP levels more than SAA levels. Our aim was to compare the effect of etanercept (ETN) and/or oralDMARDtherapy on serum SAA versus CRP levels, and to determine whether SAA levels model RA disease activity better than CRP levels, especially during treatment with a TNF antagonist. Methods: Samples were analyzed from RA subjects (n = 755) in the Treatment of Early RA (TEAR) study, a randomized, double-blind, comparative effectiveness trial. In the TEAR trial, early RA subjects with less than 2 years of disease duration were randomized to receive either combination ETN/ methotrexate (MTX) therapy (n = 244), MTX/hydrochloroquine/sulfasalazine (triple oral) therapy (n = 132) or MTX monotherapy (n = 379). MTX monotherapy subjects with a DAS28-ESR > 3.2 after 6 months were stepped up to either ETN/MTX (n=205) or triple oral therapy (n=93). Serum samples and clinical data were collected when treatment was initiated and at 24, 48 and 102 week follow up visits. We used Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) to determine the overall relationship between SAA and CRP levels, and mixed effects models to determine the fit between 1) SAA levels and DAS28-ESR and 2) CRP levels and DAS28-ESR, for subjects treated with ETN/MTX and subjects treated with oral DMARDs, while correcting for baseline SAA and CRP levels, respectively. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and parameter estimates were used to determine model fit, with DELTAAIC > 10 used as strong evidence for one model fitting better than another. Results: At the baseline visit, SAA levels were only moderately correlated with CRP levels (rho = 0.42), and the SAA and CRP correlation was similar regardless of treatment or study visit (rho range 0.35 to 0.62). Across all subjects and time points, models of the DAS28-ESR using SAA levels were better than models using CRP; the DELTAAIC between the models was 305. The model of DAS28-ESR using SAA was associated with a ~ 6 fold better fit vs. the CRP model for subjects treated with ETN/MTX, and a ~ 5 fold better fit vs. the CRP model for subjects treated with oral DMARDs (DELTAAIC = 159 vs. DELTAAIC = 137, respectively). Conclusion: The lack of a strong correlation between SAA and CRP levels coupled with their different modeling of RA disease activity suggests that SAA levels may be a better biomarker for RA disease activity than CRP, especially during treatment with TNF antagonists."

The aim of the TELERA study is to evaluate the feasibility and performance of asynchronous telemedicine visits based on patient-generated data and patient's drug history. RA patients use a medical app, ABATON, that captures the results of a self-performed quick CRP-test, joint-count, and electronic patient-reported outcomes in between visits. This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial performed in four German university centers. The estimated sample size is 120 patients. The main outcome is the agreement of rheumatologists' treatment decisions based on asynchronous telemedicine patient-generated data with traditional in-person rheumatology clinic-based decisions and with patient suggestions.

METHODS: Data from the Trial of Etanercept and Methotrexate With Radiographic Patient Outcomes (TEMPO) and the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis trials were used. Patients were classified with moderate or severe RA based on Disease Activity Score including 28-joint count (DAS28). Outcomes included DAS28 remission, DAS28 low disease activity, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scores, Total Sharp Score (TSS) progression, no radiographic progression (annualized change in TSS > or = 0), change from baseline in TSS, and the change in TSS for patients who had radiographic progression (TSS > 0).
RESULTS: Patients with moderate disease generally achieved better clinical outcomes than patients with severe disease, including significant differences in DAS28 remission, low disease activity, and HAQ < or =0.5 at Month 12. Patients with baseline severe disease had higher ACR and DAS responses than patients with moderate disease.
CONCLUSION: Patients with severe RA disease activity achieved substantial clinical improvement with high-dose MTX and/or ETN treatment, but patients with moderate disease were more likely to reach a lower disease activity state. These findings were independent of disease duration. The results support the opportunity for excellent clinical outcomes, particularly with combination therapy, in patients with moderate RA."

It further suggested that remission of RA is a realistic treatment objective. A health-economic assessment of the combination needs to demonstrate the suitability of the combination for daily clinical practice taking economic aspects into consideration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For the 686 patients in the TEMPO study, a re-analysis was carried out in the form of a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain simulation. Study types were cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis. Comparators were combined etanercept and MTX vs. MTX alone; the perspective was that of society as a whole. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the combination is 21,300 per life year in remission as compared with MTX alone. The incremental cost-utility ratio of the combination is 38,700 per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSION: Both health-economic parameters suggest to adopt the combination therapy into daily clinical practice of RA patients."

This national, multicenter, open-label, phase IIIb trial is part of an umbrella study (TOZURA). Patients were treated for 52 weeks followed by 8 weeks drug-free to evaluate immunogenicity. The primary end point was the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) change from baseline at weeks 2 and 24. Other efficacy parameters, including sleep quality, and the safety and immunogenicity were also assessed up to week 52. Of 288 patients enrolled in 43 Italian centers, 78.8% received TCZ-SC (86.8% females; mean age 54.7 +/- 12.1 years; mean disease duration 7.8 +/- 7.5 years; DMARD-IRs 94.7%). Of these, 78.0% completed the 52-week period and 52.0% received concomitant methotrexate. TCZ-SC yielded a significant reduction in median CDAI from baseline already at week 2, which progressed up to week 24 and remained stable thereafter (P < 0.0001 at each time point). A significant, rapid, and sustained improvement of the other efficacy variables was also observed. Patients were deemed as ready for home administration after a median of 2.0 (range 1-8) administrations, with a rate (since the last visit) of 80.6% and 95.5% at weeks 2 and 52, respectively. TCZ-SC displayed low immunogenicity and no unexpected toxicities. TCZ-SC, alone or with a csDMARD, yielded rapid and sustained efficacy in DMARD/anti-TNFalpha-IR RA patients, with acceptable toxicity. Home administration seems feasible."

Participants were randomised to anakinra or to a TNFi (i.e., adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, infliximab, or golimumab), and the primary end point was the change in percentage of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c%) (EudraCT: 2012-005370-62 ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT02236481). In total, 41 participants with RA and T2D were randomised, and 39 eligible participants were treated (age 62.72 +/- 9.97 years, 74.4% female sex). The majority of participants had seropositive RA disease (rheumatoid factor and/or anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody [ACPA] 70.2%) with active disease (Disease Activity Score-28 [DAS28]: 5.54 +/- 1.03; C-reactive protein 11.84 +/- 9.67 mg/L, respectively). All participants had T2D (HbA1c%: 7.77 +/- 0.70, fasting plasma glucose: 139.13 +/- 42.17 mg). When all the enrolled participants reached 6 months of follow-up, the important crude difference in the main end point, confirmed by an unplanned ad interim analysis showing the significant effects of anakinra, which were not observed in the other group, led to the study being stopped for early benefit. Participants in the anakinra group had a significant reduction of HbA1c%, in an unadjusted linear mixed model, after 3 months (beta: -0.85, p < 0.001, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.42) and 6 months (beta: -1.05, p < 0.001, 95% CI -1.50 to -0.59). Similar results were observed adjusting the model for relevant RA and T2D clinical confounders (male sex, age, ACPA positivity, use of corticosteroids, RA duration, T2D duration, use of oral antidiabetic drug, body mass index [BMI]) after 3 months (beta: -1.04, p < 0.001, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.55) and 6 months (beta: -1.24, p < 0.001, 95% CI -1.75 to -0.72). Participants in the TNFi group had a nonsignificant slight decrease of HbA1c%. Assuming the success threshold to be HbA1c% <= 7, we considered an absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 0.42 (experimental event rate = 0.54, control event rate = 0.12); thus, we estimated, rounding up, a number needed to treat (NNT) = 3. Concerning RA, a progressive reduction of disease activity was observed in both groups. No severe adverse events, hypoglycaemic episodes, or deaths were observed.

Interstitial lung disease is prevalent and morbid condition in RA (RA-ILD), affecting up to 60% of patients with RA, leading to premature death in 10% and accruing an average of US$170,000 in healthcare costs per patient over a 5-year period. Although there have been significant advances in the management of this joint disease, there are no ongoing randomized clinical trials looking at pharmacologic treatments for RA-ILD, and there currently are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for RA-ILD., METHODS/DESIGN: We describe the Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis and Interstitial Lung Disease 1 (TRAIL1) trial, a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pirfenidone in patients with RA-ILD. The study will enroll approximately 270 subjects across a network of sites who have RA and ILD as defined by a fibrotic abnormality involving greater than 10% of the lung parenchyma. The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of the composite endpoint of decline in percent predicted forced vital capacity of 10 or greater or death during the 52-week study period. A number of secondary and exploratory endpoints have been chosen to evaluate the safety and efficacy in different domains., DISCUSSION: The TRAIL1 trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pirfenidone in RA-ILD, a disease with significant impact on patients' quality of life and outcome. In addition to investigating the safety and efficacy of pirfenidone, this trial looks at a number of exploratory endpoints in an effort to better understand the impact of therapy on areas such as changes in quantitative high-resolution computed tomography scores and a patient's quality of life. Biospecimens will be collected in order to investigate biomarkers that could potentially predict the subtype of disease, its behavior over time, and its response to therapy. Finally, by creating a network of institutions and clinician investigators with an interest in RA-ILD, this trial will pave the way for future studies of investigational agents in an effort to reduce or eliminate the burden of disease for those suffering from RA-ILD., TRIAL FUNDING: Genentech, a member of the Roche Group., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT02808871."

While intensive combination therapy (Disease Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs and/or biologicals) is the most effective, rheumatologists in daily clinical practice prefer to start with monotherapy methotrexate and bridging corticosteroids. Intensive treatment should be started as soon as the first symptoms manifest, but at this early stage, ACR criteria may not be fulfilled, and there is a danger of over-treatment. We will therefore determine which induction therapy is most effective in the very early stage of persistent arthritis. To overcome over-treatment and under-treatment, the intensity of induction therapy will be based on a prediction model that predicts patients' propensity for persistent arthritis.
METHODS: A multicenter stratified randomized single-blind controlled trial is currently being performed in patients 18 years or older with recent-onset arthritis. Eight hundred ten patients are being stratified according to the likelihood of their developing persistent arthritis. In patients with a high probability of persistent arthritis, we will study combination Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drug therapy compared to monotherapy methotrexate. In patients with an intermediate probability of persistent arthritis, we will study Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drug of various intensities. In patients with a low probability, we will study non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine and a single dose of corticosteroids. If disease activity is not sufficiently reduced, treatment will be adjusted according to a step-up protocol. If remission is achieved for at least six months, medication will be tapered off. Patients will be followed up every three months over two years.
DISCUSSION: This is the first rheumatological study to base treatment in early arthritis on a prediction rule. Treatment will be stratified according to the probability of persistent arthritis, and different combinations of treatment per stratum will be evaluated. Treatment will be started early, and patients will not need to meet the ACR-criteria for rheumatoid arthritis.

11084808,,10.1101/2022.04.01.22273270,"BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung disease is a known complication of rheumatoid arthritis, with a lifetime risk of developing the disease in any individual of 7¬∑7%. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pirfenidone for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). METHODS: TRAIL1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial done in 34 academic centres specialising in interstitial lung disease in four countries (the UK, the USA, Australia, and Canada). Adults aged 18-85 years were eligible for inclusion if they met the 2010 American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology criteria for rheumatoid arthritis and had interstitial lung disease on a high-resolution CT scan imaging and, when available, lung biopsy. Exclusion criteria include smoking, clinical history of other known causes of interstitial lung disease, and coexistant clinically significant COPD or asthma. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 2403 mg oral pirfenidone (pirfenidone group) or placebo (placebo group) daily. The primary endpoint was the incidence of the composite endpoint of a decline from baseline in percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) of 10% or more or death during the 52-week treatment period assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary endpoints included change in absolute and FVC% over 52 weeks, the proportion of patients with a decline in FVC% of 10% or more, and the frequency of progression as defined by Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02808871. FINDINGS: From May 15, 2017, to March 31, 2020, 231 patients were assessed for inclusion, of whom 123 patients were randomly assigned (63 [51%] to the pirfenidone group and 60 [49%] to the placebo group). The trial was stopped early (March 31, 2020) due to slow recruitment and the COVID-19 pandemic. The difference in the proportion of patients who met the composite primary endpoint (decline in FVC% from baseline of 10% or more or death) between the two groups was not significant (seven [11%] of 63 patients in the pirfenidone group vs nine [15%] of 60 patients in the placebo group; OR 0¬∑67 [95% CI 0¬∑22 to 2¬∑03]; p=0¬∑48). Compared with the placebo group, patients in the pirfenidone group had a slower rate of decline in lung function, measured by estimated annual change in absolute FVC (-66 vs -146; p=0¬∑0082) and FVC% (-1¬∑02 vs -3¬∑21; p=0¬∑0028). The groups were similar with regards to the decline in FVC% by 10% or more (five [8%] participants in the pirfenidone group vs seven [12%] in the placebo group; OR 0¬∑52 [95% CI 0¬∑14-1¬∑90]; p=0¬∑32) and the frequency of progression as defined by OMERACT (16 [25%] in the pirfenidone group vs 19 [32%] in the placebo group; OR 0¬∑68 [0¬∑30-1¬∑54]; p=0¬∑35). There was no significant difference in the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events between the two groups, and there were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Due to early termination of the study and underpowering, the results should be interpreted with caution.

Currently, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be recognized and diagnosed when arthritis (joint swelling) has become detectable at physical examination. Importantly, at this time, the immune processes have already matured, chronicity is established, and patients require long-standing treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The TREAT EARLIER trial studies the hypothesis that intervention in the symptomatic phase preceding clinical arthritis is more often successful in permanent disease modification because of less matured underlying disease processes., METHODS: A two-level definition to identify patients that are prone to develop RA is used. First, patients should have CSA and recent-onset arthralgia (< 1 year) that is suspect to progress to RA according to the expertise of the treating rheumatologist. Second, patients need to have subclinical inflammation of the hand or foot joints at 1.5 T MRI. The trial aims to recruit 230 participants from secondary care hospital settings across the south-west region of The Netherlands. Intervention will be randomly assigned and includes a single-dose of intramuscular 120 mg methylprednisolon followed by methotrexate (increasing dose to 25 mg/week orally) or placebo (both; injection and tablets) over the course of 1 year. Thereafter, participants are followed for another year. The primary endpoint is the development of clinically detectable arthritis, either fulfilling the 2010 criteria for RA or unclassified clinical arthritis of >= 2 joints, which persists for at least 2 weeks. DMARD-free status is a co-primary endpoint. The patient-reported outcomes functioning, along with workability and symptoms, are key secondary endpoints. Participants , caregivers (including those assessing the endpoints), and scientific staff are all blinded to the group assignment., DISCUSSION: This proof-of-concept study is the logical consequence of pre-work on the identification of patients with CSA with MRI-detected subclinical joint inflammation. It will test the hypothesis whether intervention in patients in this early phase with the cornerstone treatment of classified RA (methotrexate) hampers the development of persistent RA and reduce the disease burden of RA., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register NL4599 (NTR4853).

Forty patients with rheumatoid arthritis participated in the study and were randomly assigned to two groups--20 patients were treated with HCQ (200 mg daily) and placebo, 20 patients with HCQ and MTX (7.5 mg) once a week. Patients were assessed at regular intervals of 1 month up to 6 months using six clinical and five laboratory tests and one radiological measure. All six clinical variables and two laboratory variables were favorably influenced by combination therapy during the 6-month period. HCQ alone significantly influenced only three clinical variables and none of the laboratory parameters. There was a greater number of patients without radiological progression in the combination group. There was one drop-out in combination group due to general allergic reaction; otherwise the treatment was well tolerated.

Some of these patients do not need additional therapy to reduce disease activity and even achieve sustained drug-free remission (sDFR) after tapering and stopping MTX. To identify these patients, we performed network analyses within differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identified clusters (i.e. modules) of co-expressed genes associated with achieving sDFR. Methods: data was used from DMARD-naive patients with early RA who in the U-Act-Early trial were randomized to initiate treat-to-target MTX therapy. MTX was given at a starting dose of 10 mg/week orally and was increased with 5 mg every 4 weeks until 30 mg or the maximum tolerable dose. When the treatment target, sustained remission (defined as disease activity score assessing 28 joints (DAS28) <2.6 with <=4 swollen joints for >=24 weeks), was achieved, therapy was tapered and hereafter stopped if remission was maintained. Patients achieved sDFR if they remained >=3 months in remission while being-drug free. Blood samples were collected of those achieving sDFR (n=13) and those not able to discontinue medication (n=11) as controls. Hereafter 'cluster of differentiation 4'-positive (CD4+) T Helper cells and CD14+ monocytes were isolated and analyzed using RNA sequencing. DEGs were identified and weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify clusters (i.e. modules) of co-expressed genes. Results: nine modules were identified in CD4+ cells and the module best correlated with achieving sDFR (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.60, p=0.012) included 49 co-expressed genes. Within this module, when performing pathway analyses in the Gene Ontology (GO) database, 304 terms were significantly overrepresented. Of these, response to bacterium (p=1.92E-07), response to external biotic stimulus (p=6.11E-07), and response to other organism (p=6.11E-07) were the most significant. In addition, two significant enriched pathways were found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics database: ""p53 signaling pathway"" (p=8.44E-06) and ""Jak-STAT signaling pathway"" (p=2.22E-04). The down-regulated SESN3 and ZNF585B and the upregulated CPXM1 genes showed the highest intramodular connectivity and are therefore considered as signature genes (Fig. 1). Network analyses in CD14+ cells yielded no significant modules. Conclusion: by network analyses of differentially expressed genes, several pathways were identified important for achieving sDFR in DMARD-naive with early RA after initiation of an MTX-based strategy. SESN3, ZNF585B and CPXM1 were identified as signature genes that might be used as biomarkers for RA outcome. (Figure Presented)"

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective pharmacoeconomic analysis of a 1-year randomised double-blind trial set in North America.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal and the Ontario Ministry of Health.
METHODS: Information on healthcare resources, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of working time and time spent on chores, related to the disease or the medication, were collected at 4-week intervals and at study discontinuation. Rating scale and standard gamble (SG) utilities (0 = worse; 100 = best) were collected at baseline and at 6 and 12 months or study exit. Medical care costs in Canadian dollars (Can dollars) were calculated using Ontario reimbursement schedules. US patients' expenses were converted to Can dollars using 1995 purchasing power parity. Lost wages were calculated by age and gender according to 1995 Canadian wage data. All costs were adjusted to 1999 Can dollars and arithmetic mean costs were compared using the nonparametric bootstrap. Analysis of covariance was performed to compare utilities between groups.
RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) rating scale values and SG utilities, respectively, for leflunomide, methotrexate and placebo were 67.7 (18.0), 64.8 (18.1) and 57.5 (9.2), and 80.2 (22.1), 83.2 (18.0) and 77.0 (20.5). Both leflunomide and methotrexate had higher rating scale values (p < 0.05) compared with placebo; SG utilities were significantly different between methotrexate and placebo (p < 0.05). Annualised total rheumatoid arthritisb- or drug-related costs for leflunomide, methotrexate and placebo, respectively, were Can dollars 1761, Can dollars 1280 and Can dollars 1324, and medical care costs were Can dollars 753, Can dollars 620 and Can dollars 167 (all costs exclude drug acquisition and monitoring costs). Annual drug acquisition/ routine monitoring costs were estimated, respectively, at Can dollars 3853/Can dollars 483 for leflunomide and Can dollars 258/Can dollars 599 for methotrexate. Differences between overall costs (excluding drug acquisition and monitoring costs) and medical care costs were not statistically significant. The costs of treating patients with leflunomide were significantly higher than for methotrexate when drug acquisition and monitoring costs were included (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences in utilities could be found between leflunomide or methotrexate. When drug monitoring and acquisition costs are excluded, leflunomide has an otherwise similar economic profile compared with methotrexate, the current gold standard. The acquisition cost of leflunomide is a driving factor in increasing the costs of therapy. These higher costs need to be assessed relative to the therapeutic value of leflunomide."

Objective: Our objective was to examine the safety of adalimumab administered every other week (EOW) and every week (EW) in patients with HS and psoriasis and to investigate informative data from non-dermatologic indications. Methods: The safety of adalimumab 40-mg EOW versus EW dosing was examined during placebo-controlled and open-label study periods in patients with HS (three studies), psoriasis (two studies), Crohn's disease (six studies), ulcerative colitis (three studies), and rheumatoid arthritis (one study). Results: No new safety risks or increased rates of particular adverse events (AEs) were identified with EW dosing. In patients with HS or psoriasis, the overall safety of adalimumab 40-mg EOW and EW was generally comparable. In studies of adalimumab for non-dermatologic indications, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, the overall AE rates were similar for EW and EOW dosing. Conclusion: In patients with HS or psoriasis, the safety of adalimumab EW and EOW was comparable and consistent with the expected adalimumab AE profile. The safety of adalimumab EW dosing in patients with dermatologic conditions is supported by data comparing adalimumab EW and EOW dosing for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Group I received no additional corticosteroids; Group II was treated with 3 oral pulses of 100 mg prednisolone and Group III with 3 intravenous pulses of 1000 mg methylprednisolone (MP) on alternate days during the first week. Parameters of disease activity were measured at the start, after 10 days and at regular intervals up to 1 year. In Group I maximal improvement occurred after 18 weeks and in Group III after 6 weeks. This effect was sustained during the study. The initial effects in Group II were not as strong as in Group III and of shorter duration. No serious side effects were noticed. Our results suggest, that MP-pulse therapy seems to be useful in bridging the gap between the introduction of MTX and the response to this drug.

The level rose significantly during and after Cy therapy, whereas the initial serum creatinine value did not change in the placebo group. The increase in the Cy group was not correlated with the mean Cy blood level. The rise in serum creatinine during Cy therapy was gradual and was not significantly correlated with the initial creatinine level; relative to the pretreatment value, the post-treatment increase was significantly correlated with the increase during Cy therapy. It is concluded that Cy administration for not more than 6 months, and at a maximum dosage of 10 mg/kg for 2 months, leads to an irreversible loss of more than 10% of renal function in RA patients. The damage may be ascribed to the combination of Cy with other factors compromising the kidneys, e.g., the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the potentially systemic disorder of RA."

PRIMARY OUTCOME: main Objective: the main aim of the study is compare remission (absence of symptoms and signs of arthritis) achieved with very early etanercept therapy to that achieved by current standard care (methotrexate and a treat to target regimen) with or without delayed etanercept, in patients with early, untreated rheumatoid arthritis.  We will compare differences in: a.  the proportion of patients achieving initial remission. b.  the proportion of patients who remain in sustained remission. c.  the depth of remission.  For example, we will look for signs of active arthritis on ultrasound scans and using sensitive MRI techniques.  We will also look to see the body's immune response (in rheumatoid arthritis part of the body's defence system does not act normally and attacks its own joint tissues).  We will assess if it has returned to normal using blood and urine tests and examining joint tissue (synovial biopsy tissue). Primary end point(s): the primary outcome is the proportion of patients with early, treatment-na√Øve rheumatoid arthritis that achieve clinical remission at 48 weeks, following either: 1. Initial etanercept and methotrexate treatment. 2. Initial methotrexate with 'Treat to Target' regimen: escalation to combination therapy (methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) at 12 weeks and switch to etanercept and methotrexate at/after 24 weeks if indicated by disease activity.  The definition for clinical remission used in the primary endpoint will be DAS28-ESR remission (DAS28-ESR<2.6) or physician judgement of clinical remission with DAS28-ESR low disease activity (DAS28-ESR<3.2).  DAS28-ESR is a composite score using: - the numbers of swollen and tender joints (out of 28 specified joints). - patient self-assessment of their current general health (using a visual analogue scale). - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (marker of inflammation in blood). Secondary Objective: 1.  If there are differences in efficacy of very early compared to delayed etanercept therapy, what are the reasons for this?  Are there differences in very early, untreated disease, compared to later disease which mean patients are more responsive to a TNF inhibitor?  We will evaluate differences in the appearance of joints (on ultrasound and MRI) and the body's immune cells and chemical signalling between immune cells in blood, urine and joint tissue samples.  2.  Why do some patients respond to etanercept and others do not?  We will look for factors which may predict response to etanercept: in the appearance of joints (on ultrasound and MRI), the immune system (in blood, urine and joint tissue) and genetic factors (a persons DNA, the information in their body cells they inherit from their parents will be examined by a single blood test at the start of the study).  3.

Immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation are thought to be associated with this increased risk. Early diagnosis with immediate treatment and tight control of RA forms a central treatment paradigm. It remains unclear, however, whether using tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) to achieve remission confer additional beneficial effects over standard therapy, especially on the development of CVD. Methods/Design: coronary Artery Disease Evaluation in Rheumatoid Arthritis (CADERA) is a prospective cardiovascular imaging study that bolts onto an existing single-centre, randomized controlled trial, VEDERA (Very Early versus Delayed Etanercept in Rheumatoid Arthritis).

VEDERA patients will be recruited into CADERA and undergo cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) assessment with; cine imaging, rest/stress adenosine perfusion, tissue-tagging, aortic distensibility, T1 mapping and late gadolinium imaging. Primary objectives are to detect the prevalence and change of cardiovascular abnormalities by CMR between TNFi and standard therapy over a 12-month period.

A trial of job retention vocational rehabilitation (VR) in the United States identified this helped people keep working. The effectiveness of this VR in countries with different socioeconomic policies and conditions, and its impact on absenteeism, presenteeism and health, are unknown. This feasibility study tested the acceptability of this VR, modified for the United Kingdom, compared to written advice about managing work problems. To help plan a randomized controlled trial, we tested screening, recruitment, intervention delivery, response rates, applicability of the control intervention and identified the relevant primary outcome.
METHODS: a feasibility randomized controlled trial with rheumatoid, psoriatic or inflammatory arthritis patients randomized to receive either job retention VR or written information only (the WORK-IA trial). Following three days VR training, rheumatology occupational therapists provided individualised VR on a one to one basis. VR included work assessment, activity diaries and action planning, and (as applicable) arthritis self-management in the workplace, ergonomics, fatigue and stress management, orthoses, employment rights and support services, assistive technology, work modifications, psychological and disclosure support, workplace visits and employer liaison.
RESULTS: fifty five (10%) people were recruited from 539 screened. Follow-up response rates were acceptable at 80%. VR was delivered with fidelity. VR was more acceptable than written advice only (7.8 versus 6.7). VR took on average 4¬†h at a cost of ¬£135 per person. Outcome assessment indicated VR was better than written advice in reducing presenteeism (Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) change score mean: vR¬†=¬†-12.4 (SD 13.2); control¬†=¬†-2.5 (SD 15.9), absenteeism, perceived risk of job loss and improving pain and health status, indicating proof of concept. The preferred primary outcome measure was the WLQ, a presenteeism measure.
CONCLUSIONS: this brief job retention VR is a credible and acceptable intervention for people with inflammatory arthritis with concerns about continuing to work due to arthritis.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of alfacalcidol (ILD3) or prednisone use on muscle function and disease activity in active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. The study included 67 RA patients with the active disease, disease activity score (DAS28) > 3.2, on the highest tolerable methotrexate (MTX) dose during last 3 months. Data collected were: DAS 28, muscle function tests [chair rising test (CRT) timed up and go (TUG), 6 minutes walk (6MWT), tandem walk (TW)], efficacy and safety laboratory tests. At enrollment, patients were randomly assigned to three-month supplementation with 1 mug (group A1) or 2 mug (group A2) or 3 mug (group A3) of 1alphaD3 daily or prednisone (group C) 20 mg daily, for the first month and 10 mg afterward, in addition to MTX. Results. After the treatment, we found highly significantly reduced disease activity in all four treatment arms (DAS28 p < 0.01). 1alphaD3 2 mug (A2 group, n = 19) treated patients significantly improved muscle function (TUG, 6MWT), while 1alphaD3 3 mug treated (A3, n = 16) improved 6MWT (p < 0.05), and CRT (p < 0.01). Serum 25(OH)D3 significantly decreased in the group C (p < 0.01), in contrast to its changes obtained in alfacalcidol treated ones. Conclusion. 1alphaD3 2 mug and 3 mug daily is as effective as prednisone (mean 13.3 mg daily) in RA activity control and also has the additional favorable impact on muscle function.

METHODS: This was a randomized, single-blind, parallel, controlled clinical trial. The subjects were the RA or SpA patients with the knee arthritis without deformity, moderate or severe bone erosion and obvious joint space narrowing in radiography in the target knees, who had taken at least 6-week therapy with routine dosage of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) before the study. The subjects were randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive either single intra-articular 25 mg etanercept injection or 2 ml compound betamethasone to the target knees joint after their synovial fluid being drawn away at baseline. They were followed up four weeks after injection. The primary end-point was the 4-week change in the modified Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score for the target knee.
RESULTS: Forty-seven subjects in the experimental group and twenty-three subjects in the controlled group were included in the trial. The modified HSS knee score for the experimental group was baseline mean 65.6 ¬¨¬± 14.0, follow-up 84.3 ¬¨¬± 11.1 (P < 0.0001), the controlled group baseline mean 68.2 ¬¨¬± 11.4, follow-up 79.4 ¬¨¬± 15.5 (P = 0.0015). A mean (34.9 ¬¨¬± 38.9)% improvement on the modified HSS knee score was achieved in the experimental group, while (17.9 ¬¨¬± 24.5)% improvement on the modified HSS knee score was achieved in the controlled group (P = 0.0467). Adverse events were observed in eight patients (19.0%) in the experimental group and eight patients (44.4%) in the controlled group. No serious adverse event had been observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Single intra-articular 25 mg etanercept injection had a better efficacy than 2 ml compound betamethasone. It was an effective and safe therapeutic option for SpA and RA patients who had knee arthritis without obvious change in radiography."

The diagnosis of amyloidosis was based on albuminuria, amyloid-positive rectal and/or abdominal fat aspiration and/or renal biopsies. Renal function was followed by repeated 51Cr-EDTA measurements of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Urinary albumin and serum-creatinine were found unreliable as predictors of renal function. GFR declined more rapidly in the patient group receiving only symptomatic drugs and no cytotoxic drugs (NT-group). After an initial decline, the GFR in the cytotoxic drug treatment group (T-group), mean treatment quotient 79%, levelled off and remained constant for a considerable time. The mean observation time was 45.7 months in the NT-group and 53.5 months in the T-group. Seven out of eleven patients in the NT-group developed end-stage renal disease, compared to two out of eleven patients in the T-group. The cumulative proportion of survivors in the NT-group at 36 and 60 months was 71% and 27% respectively. The corresponding figures in the T-group were 89% and 89%.

When TKA was completed and the sutured wound was bandaged, 50 ml of saline containing epinephrine diluted to 1:200,000 and 0.5 g of antibiotic was injected into the knee joint via the inserted suction drain. The drain was clamped for 20 hours and then unclamped to begin aspiration until 48 hours after surgery. To clarify the effectiveness of this method, patients were divided into three groups. Group I consisted of 116 knees (in 95 patients) infused with 50 ml saline containing a low dose of epinephrine: Group II was composed of 70 knees (42 patients) infused with 50 ml saline only; and Group III included 97 knees (78 patients) who did not undergo this drain-clamp method. The average amount of postoperative bleeding was 207 ml in Group I, 255 ml in Group II (p < 0.01), and 501 ml in Group III (p < 0.001). With this method of using saline with a low dose of epinephrine and sustained clamping of up to 20 hours, we have been able to operate on elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis without blood transfusion, even in cases of simultaneous bilateral TKA. Drain-clamping with saline infusion effectively controlled postoperative bleeding after TKA, and when epinephrine was added to the saline, the hemostatic effect was even greater than that of saline alone."

Sixty-four cases of knee replacement patients were successively selected and randomly divided into the control group and the observation group each with 32 cases. Once a day, for 7 days, patients in the control group were injected with placebo saline solution in the articular cavity. Levels of Th1 and/Th2, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were compared one month later, and implant infection rates were compared within 1-year follow-up. Compared with patients in the control group, the levels of Th1 and Th1/Th2 in the observation group significantly increased, yet their Th2 decreased. The levels of IL-2 and TNF-alpha were also observed to be significantly elevated, yet IL-10 decreased. Furthermore, their TLR-4 and ALP levels were significantly higher. Three cases of implant-related infection occurred in the control group and 1 case in the observation group. In conclusion, HBD-3 could adjust the immunity and inflammatory response of cells in the body after knee replacement, possibly playing an important role in implant-related infection.

9256781,,10.1186/1477-7525-11-55,"BACKGROUND: while arthritis is the most common cause of disability, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics experience worse arthritis impact despite having the same or lower prevalence of arthritis compared to non-Hispanic whites. People with arthritis who exercise regularly have less pain, more energy, and improved sleep, yet arthritis is one of the most common reasons for limiting physical activity. Mind-body interventions, such as yoga, that teach stress management along with physical activity may be well suited for investigation in both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Yoga users are predominantly white, female, and college educated. There are few studies that examine yoga in minority populations; none address arthritis. This paper presents a study protocol examining the feasibility and acceptability of providing yoga to an urban, minority population with arthritis.
METHODS/DESIGN: in this ongoing pilot study, a convenience sample of 20 minority adults diagnosed with either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis undergo an 8-week program of yoga classes. It is believed that by attending yoga classes designed for patients with arthritis, with racially concordant instructors; acceptability of yoga as an adjunct to standard arthritis treatment and self-care will be enhanced. Self-care is defined as adopting behaviors that improve physical and mental well-being. This concept is quantified through collecting patient-reported outcome measures related to spiritual growth, health responsibility, interpersonal relations, and stress management. Additional measures collected during this study include: physical function, anxiety/depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social roles, and pain; as well as baseline demographic and clinical data. Field notes, quantitative and qualitative data regarding feasibility and acceptability are also collected. Acceptability is determined by response/retention rates, positive qualitative data, and continuing yoga practice after three months.
DISCUSSION: there are a number of challenges in recruiting and retaining participants from a community clinic serving minority populations. Adopting behaviors that improve well-being and quality of life include those that integrate mental health (mind) and physical health (body). Few studies have examined offering integrative modalities to this population. This pilot was undertaken to quantify measures of feasibility and acceptability that will be useful when evaluating future plans for expanding the study of yoga in urban, minority populations with arthritis.

The technique was safe and effective in improving grip strength, with a group mean improvement of more than 50%. Because suppression of endogenous cortisol production 24 h after treatment was commensurate with the dose of methylprednisolone used (40 mg), we could not exclude that the response may have been due to systemic steroid.

Treatment efficacy was assessed by standard clinical parameters and by continuous actigraphic recordings of wrist movements. Both drugs significantly suppressed the level of activity during the first 2 hours after waking from sleep, in comparison with placebo. This was paralleled by a significant improvement in clinical parameters such as duration of morning stiffness, grip strength and subjective assessment of pain. The decrease in the post-awakening level of actigraphic recordings was interpreted to suggest an improvement in the patient's ability to perform smooth purposeful movements. There were no drug-related effects on actigraphically derived sleep parameters. The level of movements in sleep was significantly related, however, to several clinical parameters.

First, 24 patients were taught a relaxation technique and then trained in either temperature elevation or reduction. Second, a group of 15 patients thus trained was compared with 8 others who received traditional physiotherapy modalities. Psychological tests, functional/physical evaluations, as well as measurements related to pain, sleep, and other activities were carried out. Results of the first study revealed significant and positive changes following treatment that were primarily related to pain, tension, and sleep patterns for both groups, but  no differential effects were noted between temperature elevation or reduction conditions. This was attributed to both groups having maintained temperature above baseline during biofeedback training. The results of the second study consistently favored the relaxation and biofeedback over the physiotherapy group  on the physical/functional indices.

Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of RA (as defined by American College of Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism 2010 Criteria) of >= 3-month disease duration, willing and able to self inject, continuous treatment with 1 or a combination of nonbiologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (except leflunomide in combination with methotrexate); and moderatly to severely active RA, defined as 4/66 swollen joint, 4/68 tender joints, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) measurement >= 4 mg/L. Exclusion criteria were age Patients were randomized 1: 1: 1: 1 to sarilumamb 150 or 200 mg every 2 weeks administered by single-use, disposable, prefilled pen or pre-filled syringe. Randomization method was not reported. Main outcomes measures. The primary endpoint was number of ""product technical failures"" (PTFs). Patients randomized to the pen were given a diary that had questions related to their ability to remove the cap, start the injection, and complete the injection. Participants were asked to answer the questions each time they used the pen. If the response was ""no"" to any of the 3 questions, this was considered a ""product technical complaint"" (PTC). PTCs that had a validated technical cause based on pen evaluation and analysis were considered PTFs. In addition, patient perceptions and satisfaction with the pen were assessed via questionnaire. At baseline, patients were asked about injections and prior experience with self-injection, and at 12 weeks they were asked about their experiences in using the pen. Other outcomes assessed included adverse events and pharmokinetic parameters. Results. 217 participants were enrolled: 108 patients were in the pen group (56 randomized to 150 mg and 52 randomized to 200 mg) and 109 were in the syringe group (53 randomized to 150 mg and 56 randomized to 200 mg). Completion rates were similar among groups. Sixteen patients discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events. There were no PTFs. There was one PTC, in which the user accidently bumped the pen, which expelled the drug onto the floor. At baseline, before the first injection, the majority of patients reported that they were not afraid of needles (58%), had past experience with self-injections (55%), and were either ""very confident"" or ""extremely confident"" regarding self-injections (55%). After the 12-week assessment phase, when asked about their overall level of satisfaction, 98% of patients reported they were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with the sarilumab pen. Treatment emergent adverse events occurred in 66% of patients, with no clinically meaningful differences leading to discontinuation in the pen and syringe groups. The most common adverse events were infections and neutropenia. Conclusion. Patients successfully completed self-injections with the sarilumab pen and found it easy to use.

Design Single-arm open trial with historical controls. Setting Regional hospital, Hong Kong. Patients All new rheumatoid arthritis patients (onset <2 years) attending the tight control clinic from October 2008 to October 2009 were recruited. All the patients were followed up every 3 to 6 weeks and clinically assessed using the Disease Activity Score 28. Disease-modifying agent treatment was stepped up according to a preset protocol ladder and patient tolerance. The treatment target was to achieve a Disease Activity Score 28 of 3.2 or below (low disease activity). These patients were compared to matched historical controls in the rheumatology clinic. Results Twenty patients in the tight control early rheumatoid arthritis clinic were recruited. Their disease activities were brought into better control than historical control patients who were followed up every 12 weeks. At week 52, clinical variables showed greater improvements in the intensive care group; respective mean scores (based on the Disease Activity Score 28 system) were 2.7 versus 4.2 (P<0.001); respective mean Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were 0.2 versus 1.3 (P<0.001). Conclusion Outcomes of patients attending our locally adapted tight control clinic were consistent with previous reports in the literature. The clinic reduced rheumatoid arthritis activity faster and better. It entailed more frequent follow-up and monitoring, however. To address this strategy more objectively, a randomised trial with parallel controls is necessary."

Methods: Seventy pSS patients were randomly assigned to two groups using a randomized digital table: the integrative therapy group (36 cases) and the control group (34 cases). Thirty healthy subjects were taken as a normal group. The control group was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets alone, and the integrative therapy group was treated by Chinese herbal medicines for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood combined with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. The treatment course was 6 months for both groups. Before and after treatment, serum estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL) by radioimmunoassay and immunoglobulin (IgG) by immunodiffusion, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) by Westergren, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were determined. Results: E2 and T levels in all patients were lower than those of normal subjects before treatment (P<0.05) and were increased significantly after 6-month treatment (P<0.05). ESR, FSH, LH, IgG, IFN - gamma, IL - 4 and ratios of E2/T, and IFN -gamma/IL in the patients were higher than those of normal subjects before the treatments (P<0.05), and were reduced significantly after the treatments (P<0.05). The T and IFN - gamma levels and E2/T ratio in the patients treated with integrative therapy were reduced significantly compared with the control group (P<0.05). However, the PRL levels before and after treatment were not significantly changed in the two groups (P>0.05). The ratios of E2/T and IFN -gamma/IL-4, and levels of IgG and ESR were positively correlated before and after treatment (P<0.05). Conclusions: The ratios of E2/T and IFN -gamma/IL-4 might be used as indicators of pSS activity. Chinese herbal medicines for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood combined with Western medicine could improve the therapeutic effect by regulating the reproductive endocrine-immune network in pSS patients."

Patients with RA are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Smokers with RA tend to experience more pain and fatigue, higher disease activity, more erosive joint destruction and a lower health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) than non-smokers. It remains to be determined whether these effects can be reduced by smoking cessation. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) in patients with RA aims to examine the effect of intensive smoking cessation intervention (motivational counselling combined with tailored nicotine replacement therapy) versus standard care on smoking cessation, and consequently on disease activity. Secondary objectives are to explore the effect on flare, risk factors for CVD, lung function, physical function, HR-QoL, pain and fatigue in patients with RA. // METHODS: This will be a multicentre, open label, two arm, parallel group, RCT, including 150 daily smokers with RA, being in remission or having low-moderate disease activity (DAS28<=5.1). The intervention group (n=75) will receive five counselling sessions with a trained smoking cessation counsellor based on the principles of motivational counselling. Furthermore, intervention patients will be offered nicotine replacement therapy tailored to individual needs. Participants randomised to the control group will receive standard care. The co-primary outcome is a hierarchical endpoint, which will be evaluated at 3 months follow-up and will include (1) self-reported smoking cessation biochemically validated by exhaled carbon monoxide and (2) achievement of EULAR clinical response (an improvement in DAS28 of>0.6). Follow-up visits will be performed at 3, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. // DISCUSSION: This trial will reveal whether intensive smoking cessation counselling helps smokers with RA to achieve continuous smoking cessation and whether, as a concomitant benefit, it will reduce their RA disease activity. The trial aims to generate high quality evidence for the feasibility of a health promotion intervention for smokers with RA. // TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02901886 .

MATERIALS AND METHODS: the study included patients with rheumatoid arthritis classified according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria without any previous participation in disease-specific educational programs. The patients were randomly assigned to an educational program intervention or a waiting list. The intervention was a 6-week educational program consisting of weekly sessions lasting 1 hour each. Evaluations by a blind assessor were made prior to intervention and after 45, 90 and 180 days. The main outcome variables were the Patient Knowledge Questionnaire and the Short-form Health Survey (SF-36) quality of life questionnaire. Secondary outcome variables were the Health Assessment Questionnaire, Visual Analogue Pain Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.
RESULTS: patients in the intervention group (n=28) had significant improvement in disease-specific knowledge compared to patients in control group (n=30). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of pain, depression, anxiety or functional capacity, but the ""general health perception"" subscale of SF-36 showed a significant improvement in the intervention group (p=0.041). There was a positive correlation between improvement of disease-specific knowledge and schooling.
CONCLUSION: patients who attended the educational program had significant improvement in disease-specific knowledge and general health perception. No harmful effects on their psychosocial status were noticed. The acquisition of knowledge was also found to be proportional to schooling."

In the first group, snowstorm-like echogenic particles were observed after deflation of the tourniquet in all patients according to the transesophageal echocardiography.
RESULTS: In addition, the PaO(2) level was significantly decreased. Also, one had a PE, and DVT was confirmed in two patients. In the without-tourniquet group, none of these conditions was noted.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the use of a tourniquet will promote the risk of developing postoperative PE and/or DVT after total knee arthroplasty."

OBJECTIVE: We studied whether subjects with primary SS showed a biochemical deficiency of pyridoxine, and if it is associated with abnormal production of interleukin-2 from lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with phytohemagglutinin (PHA).
DESIGN: Two studies were conducted, (i) biochemical and nutritional assessments were performed in a cross-over study in subjects with primary SS, who were supplemented with 25 mg/day of pyridoxine or placebo for 3 months. After 1 month washout, they were supplemented for 3 months with placebo, (ii) patients with SS and matched controls received pyridoxine or placebo for 45 days, and a blood sample was obtained to study IL-2 production and expression in T-lymphocytes stimulated with PHA.
RESULTS: Subjects with primary SS showed limited dietary intake of pyridoxine and biochemical deficiency of this vitamin assessed through the activation coefficient of the erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase. The biochemical deficiency did not affect production nor mRNA expression of IL-2 from T-lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with PHA compared with the control group. Supplementation of subjects with primary SS with 25 mg/day with pyridoxine for 45 days did not produce any significant change as compared to those patients supplemented with placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with primary SS showed biochemical deficiency of pyridoxine, possibly due to limited intake of this vitamin which was corrected by supplementation with pyridoxine. However, IL-2 production and mRNA expression from stimulated lymphocytes were unaffected by supplementation, probably because the deficiency was not severe enough to affect the immune system.

However, there is a paucity of modern medical evidence to support its effectiveness and safety. Thus, we propose to implement a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using, as the experimental intervention, topical application of a hospital-compounded gel preparation of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF).
METHODS: this study will be an 8-week double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at Guang'anmen Hospital in Beijing, China, and 168 patients with moderately active RA will be randomly assigned with a 1: 1 ratio to apply a topical gel preparation containing TwHF or placebo. The primary outcome variable will be the proportion of subjects, by study group, to achieve a 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) by week 8. Secondary outcome measures to be assessed at weeks 4 or 8 will include: measurement of ACR20 response rate at week 4, ACR50 response rate, the changes in DAS28 score, and joint synovitis classification assessment monitored by musculoskeletal ultrasound. Safety evaluations conducted at weeks 4, 8 and 12 will be based on spontaneous complaints by the study subjects, but special emphasis will be focused on cutaneous allergy and alterations of menstruation in premenopausal female participants. Statistical analyses will be performed using the intention to treat analysis data set.
DISCUSSION: this proposed clinical trail is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CET based on a single topically-applied agent in a relatively large patient population with RA. This study protocol gives a detailed description of the usage and dosage of the topical compound TwHF gel and the methodology of this study. In addition, it is hoped that the outcomes of this study will be viewed as supporting the generalizability of CET in the setting of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The results of this study are expected to have important public health implications for Asian RA patients that currently utilize CET as a complimentary treatment.

The effect of administration of cholecalcipherol on clinical and laboratory parameters was subsequently evaluated, by a parallel, randomized double blind, placebo controlled trial. Thirty nine eRA patients and 31 age-matched controls were enrolled and compared for levels of 25OH vitamin D, T helper cell sub-types, OCs precursors including both classical and non-classical and pro-inflammatory cytokines at baseline. Eligible patients were female ‚â•18 years of age with a diagnosis of RA, as defined by the American College of Rheumatology 2010 criteria for <6 months prior to inclusion in the study. Patients with auto-immune or inflammatory diseases other than RA were excluded. Patients treated with glucocorticoids (GCs), disease modifying activity drugs and biologic agents within the past 6 months were also excluded. In the second phase of the study, eRA patients were randomly assigned to standard treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and GCs with (21) or without (18) cholecalcipherol (300,000 IU) and followed for 3 months; the randomization was done by computer generated tables to allocate treatments. Three patients didn't come back to the follow up visit for personal reasons. None of the patients experienced adverse events. The main outcome measures were T cells phenotypes, OCs precursors and inflammatory cytokines. Secondary outcome measure were clinical parameters. In eRA, 25OH vitamin D levels were significantly lower. CD4+/IFNŒ≥+,CD4+/IL4+, CD4+/IL17A+ and CD4+IL17A+IFNŒ≥+, cells were increased in eRA as well as non-classical OCs precursors, whereas T regulatory cells were not altered. TNFŒ±, TGFŒ≤1, RANKL, IL-23 and IL-6 were increased in eRA. Non-classical OCs, IL-23 and IL-6 correlated with disease severity and activity. Standard treatment with MTX and GC ameliorated clinical symptoms and reduced IL-23, whereas it did not affect CD4+ cells sub-sets nor OCs precursors. After 3 months, the combined use of cholecalcipherol significantly ameliorated the effect of treatment on global health. In eRA, a significant imbalance in T CD4+ sub-types accompanied by increased levels of non-classical OCs precursors and pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed. A single dose of cholecalcipherol (300,000 IU) combined with standard treatment significantly ameliorates patients general health."

To describe clinical fracture rates, back pain, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are receiving glucocorticoids (GC), during a 36-month study of teriparatide treatment for up to 18 months, with an additional 18-month followup period when patients were receiving other osteoporosis medications. Methods. A prospective, multinational, observational study. Data for clinical fractures, back pain (by visual analog scale; VAS) and HRQOL (by EQ-5D) were collected over 36 months. Fracture data were summarized in 6-month segments and analyzed using logistic regression with repeated measures. Changes from baseline in back pain VAS and EQ-VAS were analyzed. Results. Of 1581 enrolled women with followup data, 294 (18.6%) had antecedents of GC use. Of these, 49 (16.7%) patients sustained a total of 69 fractures during the 36-month study period. Adjusted odds of fracture were significantly decreased during the last year of followup compared with the first 6 months of teriparatide treatment: an 81% decrease in the 24 to < 30-month period (p < 0.05), and an 89% decrease in the 30 to < 36-month period (p < 0.05). There were significant reductions in back pain and improvements in HRQOL in both groups of GC users and nonusers. Conclusion. Postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis receiving GC, who were treated with teriparatide for up to 18 months, showed a reduced incidence of clinical fractures during the third year while receiving sequential osteoporosis treatments compared with the first 6 months, together with reduced back pain and improved HRQOL.

METHODS: Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin, 150 mg/day (Group A), or indomethacin 150 mg/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg/day (Group B). Laboratory variables of renal function [serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days, until termination of the study (a period of at least 6 days). Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study, 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B. BUN and creatinine increased by > 50% of baseline levels in 54 and 45% of Group A patients, respectively, compared to only 20 and 10% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). Potassium (K) increment of 0.6 mEq/l or more was observed in 50% of Group A, but in only 15% of Group B patients (p < 0.05).

The objectives were to define the percentage of clinical scenarios from an ongoing cohort of RA outpatients in which the German Ultrasound Score on 7 joints (GUS-7) impacted the treatment and to explore if the impact differed between a senior rheumatologist (SR) vs. a trainee (TR).
METHODS: eighty-five consecutive and randomly selected RA outpatients underwent 170 assessments, 85 each by the SR and the TR. Initially, both physicians (blinded to each other) performed a rheumatic assessment and recommended a preliminary treatment. Then, the patients underwent the GUS-7 evaluation by an experienced rheumatologist blinded to clinical evaluations; selected joints of the clinically dominant hand were assessed by gray-scale and power Doppler (PD). In the final step, the TR and the SR integrated the GUS-7 findings with their previous evaluation and reviewed their recommendations. The patients received the final recommendation from the SR to avoid patient confusion. The study was approved by the Internal Review Board and all the patients signed informed consent. GUS-7 usefulness was separately evaluated by the SR and the TR according to a visual analogue scale (0¬†=¬†not useful at all, 10¬†=¬†very useful). Descriptive statistics were used.
RESULTS: the patients were primarily middle-aged females (91.4%) with (mean¬†¬±¬†SD) disease duration of 7.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.9¬†years. The majority of them (69.2% according to TR and 71.8% to SR) were in DAS28-ESR-remission.

Treatment changes (increase, decrease and joint injection) were similar between both specialists. As expected, the TR rated the GUS-7 usefulness higher than the SR, particularly in the clinical scenarios where the GUS-7 findings impacted treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: musculoskeletal ultrasound added to standard rheumatic assessments impacted the treatment proposal in a limited number of patients; the impact was greater in the TR."

We studied a large group of patients with JRA in order to determine the degree of correlation between clinically apparent inflammation and the ESR. regression and correlation analyses and descriptive statistical techniques were used to establish the relationship between 1) the ESR and the amount of clinically apparent inflammation at a point in time, and 2) changes in the ESR and the corresponding changes in apparent inflammation. One hundred fifty-nine children with JRA who were participants in a double-blind, controlled trial of two antirheumatic drugs were assessed for clinical and laboratory evidence of inflammatory disease activity at an initial visit, and then periodically for the duration of the one year study. Results showed that, at the initial assessment, neither the total number of joints with active arthritis nor the severity score correlated well with the ESR (r = .196 and .245 respectively). These findings were independent of the course type of JRA and age of the child. Changes from baseline in inflammation showed little correlation (r less than .25) with changes in the ESR. These findings suggest that the ESR is a relatively poor indicator of the amount of articular inflammation present, and that changes of disease activity are not reflected closely by changes in the ESR among children with JRA."

The number of painful and swollen joints decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) in the piroxicam group. The overall assessment of the investigators was that 67% of the patients in the piroxicam group showed clinical improvement, in contrast to 38% of the naproxen-treated patients. Side effects in the piroxicam group were mild and transient, and no patient was removed from the study because of side effects.

In contrast to AA, which is an omega-6 fatty acid, the omega-3 fatty acids, after having been liberated from the cell membrane phospholipids, are further converted into the non- or anti-inflammatory eicosanoids LTB5 and PGI3. AA concentration is an important regulatory step in the synthesis of both prostanoids and leukotriens. Dietary supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has therefore been used to decrease the ratio of AA to EPA or DHA to obtain beneficial clinical effects. EPA and DHA are found in animal fat and are quite expensive compared to their precursor alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA) found in flaxseed oil. We, therefore, performed a placebo-controlled trial with alpha-LNA in 22 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, using a linoleic acid preparation as a placebo. After a 3-month follow-up, the treatment group showed an increased bleeding time, but the clinical, subjective (global assessment, classification of functional status, joint score index, visual analogue scale, pain tenderness score) and laboratory parameters (haemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) did not show any statistical alterations. AA, EPA and DHA did not change either in spite of a significant increase in alpha-LNA in the treatment group. Thus, 3-month's supplementation with alpha-LNA did not prove to be beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis."

9257083,,10.2196/jmir.9997,"BACKGROUND: internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy can aid patients with rheumatoid arthritis with elevated levels of distress to enhance their quality of life. However, implementation is currently lacking and there is little evidence available on the (cost-) effectiveness of different treatment strategies. OBJECTIVE: cost-benefit ratios are necessary for informing stakeholders and motivating them to implement effective treatment strategies for improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A cost-effectiveness study from a societal perspective was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial on a tailored, therapist-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) intervention for patients with rheumatoid arthritis with elevated levels of distress as an addition to care as usual (CAU). METHODS: data were collected at baseline or preintervention, 6 months or postintervention, and every 3 months thereafter during the 1-year follow-up. Effects were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs from a societal perspective, including health care sector costs (health care use, medication, and intervention costs), patient travel costs for health care use, and costs associated with loss of labor. RESULTS: the intervention improved the quality of life compared with only CAU (DELTA QALYs=0.059), but at a higher cost (DELTA=4211). However, this increased cost substantially reduced when medication costs were left out of the equation (DELTA=1863). Of all, 93% (930/1000) of the simulated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were in the north-east quadrant, indicating a high probability that the intervention was effective in improving HRQoL, but at a greater monetary cost for society compared with only CAU. CONCLUSIONS: a tailored and guided ICBT intervention as an addition to CAU for patients with rheumatoid arthritis with elevated levels of distress was effective in improving quality of life. Consequently, implementation of ICBT into standard health care for patients with rheumatoid arthritis is recommended. However, further studies on cost reductions in this population are warranted.

Results: significant reductions in fatigue scores and disease activity were observed from baseline to 6 months after. A predictive regression model of fatigue severity was proposed and was found to be significant, with RA disease activity as the most significant predictor of fatigue severity. Conclusion: this quasi-experimental study is a good starting point for research on the efficacy of adalimumab in treating fatigue in RA patients. The results here suggest that a randomized controlled trial assessing adalimumab as a treatment option for RA patients suffering from fatigue is warranted"

The phase 3 SARIL-RA-EASY study (EASY) assessed the robustness of an autoinjector (pen) for administering sarilumab when used by adults with active moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are candidates for anti-IL-6R therapy in an unsupervised real-world setting. Methods: EASY was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group usability study of the sarilumab pen and prefilled syringe. Patients were randomized 1: 1: 1: 1 to sarilumab 150 or 200 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) administered via pen or syringe, plus background disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients reported their ability to remove the pen cap and initiate and complete injections; negative responses were defined as product technical complaints (PTCs). The primary endpoint was the number of validated product technical failures (PTFs; PTC with a validated technical cause). This study was not powered to demonstrate bioequivalence or differences in efficacy among groups. Results: a total of 217 patients were randomized. There were 600 successful injections with the sarilumab pen in 108 patients and no pen-associated PTFs. One PTC was observed (the pen was mistakenly activated before injection). At week 12, 88% of patients indicated the pen was ""easy"" to use, and 98% reported they were ""satisfied"" with the pen. Proportions of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 response and a 28-joint disease activity score by C-reactive protein < 2.6 were similar at each dose between the pen and syringe groups, as were the pharmacokinetics. There were no clinically meaningful differences in adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation in the pen and syringe groups. The most common treatment-emergent AEs were infections and neutropenia. Conclusion: this study demonstrated the ease of use and robustness of the sarilumab pen when used by patients with RA in an unsupervised setting. Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy were generally similar for the pen and syringe groups (NCT02057250). Funding: sanofi Genzyme and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Peer mentoring has been shown to improve positive health behaviours in adolescents with chronic disease while simultaneously providing social support. The objectives of this paper are to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an online peer mentoring program (iPeer2Peer Program) for adolescents with JIA.
METHODS: the iPeer2Peer program was examined using a waitlist pilot randomized control trial (RCT). Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention or wait-list control group via a secure, web-based randomization service. Health care providers and investigators were blinded to participant group allocation. Trained peer mentors (16-25 years; successfully managing their JIA) were matched to participants (12-18 years; diagnosed with JIA) randomized to the intervention group to provide peer support and education for effective self-management of JIA. Participant-mentor pairings connected ten times over 8¬†weeks using Skype video calls. Primary outcomes focused on implementation (i.e. measures of feasibility and acceptability). Secondary outcomes focused on effectiveness (i.e. measures of self-management, self-efficacy, pain, social support and quality of life).
RESULTS: thirty adolescents (mean age 14.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.7¬†years, 97¬†% female) completed the RCT (intervention n‚Äâ=‚Äâ16, control n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14).

Non-adherence was more likely if physicians disagreed with DAS or next treatment step. In the DAS <1.6 steered protocol, non-adherence was also associated with discrepancies between subjective and (semi)objective disease outcomes, and often against required treatment intensification. These results may indicate that adherence to DAS-steered protocols appears to depend in part on the height of the target and on how physicians perceive the DAS reflects RA activity."

9257130,,10.1007/s12325-016-0372-z,"INTRODUCTION: only limited information is available on cost efficacy of the various biological agents used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis with intolerance or for whom it would be inappropriate to continue treatment with conventional agents. We estimated the efficacy and treatment costs of monotherapy with biological agents in the treatment of this group of patients.
METHODS: data from two previous meta-analyses in the treatment of patients who are intolerant to methotrexate (MTX), or for whom it would be inappropriate to continue treatment with MTX was used. Pharmacoeconomic comparison between biological agents was carried out to estimate the respective cost for the number needed to treat (NNT) compared to placebo using both American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. The analysis involved the four agents approved in Italy: adalimumab (ADA), etanercept (ETN), certolizumab pegol (CTZ), and tocilizumab (TCZ). A six-month period was considered sufficient to understand the most important differences in efficacy and treatment costs. Direct medical costs, including pharmacological therapy, administration and monitoring were considered.
RESULTS: using both ACR and EULAR criteria, TCZ (intravenous [iv]/subcutaneous [sc]) had a lower NNT than the other agents. The difference in NNT observed for ETN was more pronounced with EULAR criteria, whereas in the comparison with ADA, the most sensitive differences were observed with ACR criteria. ETN had the lowest treatment cost (‚Ç¨6402.19), followed by ADA (‚Ç¨6698.84), TCZ sc (‚Ç¨6887.61), and TCZ iv (‚Ç¨7130.83). TCZ sc had the lowest cost for NNT with both ACR and EULAR criteria. The differences compared to ETN and ADA were significant and related with the level of efficacy. Sensitivity analysis confirmed these results.
CONCLUSION: TCZ is a cost-effective therapeutic option compared to other tumor necrosis factor-Œ± inhibitors (ADA, ETA, CTZ) as first-line monotherapy for patients who are intolerant to MTX, or for whom it is inappropriate to continue treatment with MTX.

DESIGN: ¬†Multicentre, open label, two arm, parallel group, randomised controlled strategy trial.
SETTING: ¬†Ten rheumatology departments and one specialist centre in Norway, from September 2010 to September 2015.
PARTICIPANTS: ¬†238 patients were recruited between September 2010 and April 2013, of which 230 (141 (61%) female) received the allocated intervention and were analysed for the primary outcome. The main inclusion criteria were age 18-75 years, fulfilment of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis, disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug naivety with indication for disease modifying drug therapy, and time from first patient reported swollen joint less than two years. Patients with abnormal kidney or liver function or major comorbidities were excluded.
INTERVENTIONS: ¬†122 patients were randomised to an ultrasound tight control strategy targeting clinical and imaging remission, and 116 patients were randomised to a conventional tight control strategy targeting clinical remission. Patients in both arms were treated according to the same disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug escalation strategy, with 13 visits over two years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ¬†The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a combination between 16 and 24 months of clinical remission, no swollen joints, and non-progression of radiographic joint damage. Secondary outcomes included measures of disease activity, radiographic progression, functioning, quality of life, and adverse events. All participants who attended at least one follow-up visit were included in the full analysis set.
RESULTS: ¬†26 (22%) of the 118 analysed patients in the ultrasound tight control arm and 21 (19%) of the 112 analysed patients in the clinical tight control arm reached the primary endpoint (mean difference 3.3%, 95% confidence interval -7.1% to 13.7%). Secondary endpoints (disease activity, physical function, and joint damage) were similar between the two groups. Six (5%) patients in the ultrasound tight control arm and seven (6%) patients in the conventional arm had serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: ¬†The systematic use of ultrasound in the follow-up of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis treated according to current recommendations is not justified on the basis of the ARCTIC results. The findings highlight the need for randomised trials assessing the clinical application of medical technology.Trial registration¬†Clinical trials NCT01205854."

The physical training was adapted to individual disabilities. We assessed the patients in three time points: baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) for functional ability and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for emotional status. Results: the mean difference in change both in the HAQ score and the HADS score between the two groups was statistically significant and in favor of the interventional group only at 12 months (p=0.005).

Therefore, we examined the hypothesis that improving insulin sensitivity with pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione PPAR- agonist, would decrease inflammation in patients with RA. Methods: In a single center, randomized, double blind, placebocontrolled cross-over trial of 20 weeks duration, patients with RA (n=34) and moderate disease activity receiving stable disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy were randomized to receive either pioglitazone 45mg daily (n=17) or matchingplacebo (n=17) for 8 weeks in addition to current therapy. This was followed by a 4 week wash-out period and then patients received the alternative regimen for the next 8 weeks.Primary outcome measures were change in DAS28 score; individual components of the DAS28 score including tender and swollen joint count, patient reported disease activity based on visual analog scale (VAS), and acute phase reactants; and change in insulin resistance determined by the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA). Disease activity variables, inflammatory markers, and fasting insulin and glucose were measured. Analysis was by intention to treat and linear mixed effect models were used to determine the effect of pioglitazone on outcome measures. Results: Patients had a median [IQR] age of 52.5 years [44.2-59.5 years], 82% were female and baseline median DAS28 CRP was 4.24 [3.62-5.6]. Compared to placebo, the addition of pioglitazone was associated with a 0.368 unit (95% CI, 0.0002-0.735) reduction in DAS28 CRP, (P=0.036), a 48.7% (28.5-63.1%) decrease in CRP (P<0.001), and a 23.7% (1.1-41.1%) decrease in insulin resistance as measured by HOMA (P=0.04). There was no significant reduction in swollen (P=0.83) or tender joint count (P=0.43), and a non-significant trend toward decreased patient reported disease activity VAS by 9.8mm (-0.1-19.7mm) (P=0.05). There was no significant change in ESR (p=0.27) or DAS28 ESR (P=0.92). Lower extremity edema was more common during pioglitazone (16%) treatment than placebo (0%); otherwise, adverse events occurred with similar frequency. Conclusion: The addition of pioglitazone to current RA treatment improves insulin resistance and modestly reduces RA disease activity measured by DAS28 CRP and CRP levels."

It is much less expensive than biologics. We evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of IGU, methotrexate (MTX), and IGU+MTX for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA patients were randomly divided into three groups: iGU+MTX, placebo+IGU and placebo+MTX group. Relevant laboratory parameters were periodically reviewed and clinical outcome measures were assessed after 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weeks. Symptoms of all patients significantly improved after treatment. After four weeks of treatment, differences in American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria response rate (ACR20) between any of the groups were not significant. However, ACR20 response rate improved more in the MTX+IGU group compared to the monotherapy groups. After 24 weeks of treatment, combined treatment with IGU and MTX was superior to monotherapy with either IGU or MTX. There were no significant differences between the incidences of adverse effects among the three treatment groups. In conclusion: the treatment of RA with IGU is effective, and the effect of IGU treatment becomes apparent earlier than MTX treatment. To some extent, the combination of IGU and MTX results in an additive therapeutic effect. IGU+MTX maybe used as first-line treatment instead of MTX. Copyright ¬© 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

This is called equipoise. Ideally patient-participants should also be in equipoise. In pediatric rheumatology, there are no data on whether this uncertainty also consists among parents and patients or if they have a specific preference for a particular treatment strategy. We conducted an interview study on the preferences of parents and children and the influence of the informed consent procedure on preferences in the setting of a randomized clinical trial in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis patients. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with parents (n = 23, 1 father and 22 mothers) and patients aged 12 and older (n = 7) participating in the BeSt for Kids study, a randomized clinical trial with three treatment strategies (arm 1: initial monotherapy with sulfasalazine or methotrexate, arm 2: initial combination therapy with methotrexate and prednisone and arm 3: initial combination therapy with etanercept and methotrexate) in selected categories of newly diagnosed juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients. Results: All parents had a preference for a particular treatment strategy, 65% had a preference for the combination therapy with etanercept and methotrexate (arm 3). Five parents and two patients participated in the study to have a chance to be initially treated with etanercept, as initial treatment with etanercept in daily practice is currently neither possible nor reimbursed. The preference of parents and patients for arm 3 was based on their idea that etanercept is the best treatment for juvenile arthritis. The parents indicated that these beliefs were mainly based on knowledge they had gained through the internet and from experiences from people in their environment. Four parents had a preference for a non-prednisone arm. Aversion for prednisone was primary due to the fear for side-effects, such as weight gain. According to four parents, the physician-investigator had a preference for arm 3, but the vast majority of parents (n = 19) stated that the physician-investigator had no preferred strategy. Similar results emerged from the interviews with children. Conclusion: A large part of parents and children in the BeSt for Kids study are not in equipoise. In this study this is not caused by an assumed preference of the physician-investigator but by information on the various treatment possibilities obtained from other sources. The question is whether the absence of equipoise in parents and patients indicates that randomization is unethical or that this equipoise is not feasible in medical research."

Adverse effects were comparable, although indigestion was seen slightly more often during indoprofen treatment. Indoprofen is therefore at least as effective as existing anti-inflammatory drugs in rheumatoid arthritis and seems to be better tolerated."

Results: Of those who completed RCT 1 or 2, 98% (N=182, safety population) enrolled: tabalumab 60 mg (n=60), tabalumab 60/120 mg (n=121), and 1 pt after taking tabalumab 120 mg then returned to 60 mg. Baseline (pre-tabalumab) RA activity levels were generally higher for the 60/120 mg group. Overall, both groups appeared to maintain efficacy with long-term treatment (Table 1). One pt died due to myocardial infarction (60/120 mg). In each group, 5% discontinued due to an adverse event (AE). There was a higher frequency of serious AEs (SAEs) and treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs, including severe events) as well as events of interest, including infections and injection-site reactions in the 60/120 mg group. Most infections involved the upper respiratory tract. One pt (60/120 mg) reported a fungal skin infection. No clinically significant differences in hematologic or chemistry values, vital signs, or ECGs were seen. Total B lymphocyte counts decreased by 40% from pretabalumab baseline for all groups. The incidence of treatment-emergent, antitabalumab antibodies was 4.4% (8/182). Table 2 shows more detailed safety data. (Figure presented)."
9257161,,10.3899/jrheum.130881,"Background/Purpose: The objective of this study was to review the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with adult's Still disease treated with tocilizumab (TCZ) in Israel. Methods: Israeli rheumatologists who have ever treated a patient suffering from adult Still's disease with TCZ were asked to review their files with special emphasis on the symptoms of the disease (arthralgias/arthritis, fever, sore throat, pleura-pericarditis, hepatitis), number of tender and swollen joints, ESR, CRP and dosage of prednisone at the initiation of TCZ, after 6 months and at the end of follow-up. Results:: 11 cases were ascertained. All the patients fullfilled the Yamagushi classification criteria for adult Still's disease: 7 men, aged 33+12, mean duration of disease of 7 years ( range 1-25 years). Until treatment with TCZ, the mean number of disease modifying drugs, including TNFalpha blockers was 4; 7 out of 11 have previously failed TNFalpha blockers. TCZ was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks in 8 patients and every 2 weeks in 3 patients. The mean follow- up was 15 months. All the patients, except 2, completed at least 6 months of treatment. At the start of TCZ treatment, despite a mean prednisone of 31mg+28 mg/d, all the patients reported joint pain; the mean tender and swollen joints count was 12 and 8, respectively. In addition, fever was reported in 7 patients, rash in 5, pleuritis in 3 and hepatitis in 2.The mean ESR and CRP were 65 and 13, respectively. After 6 months of treatment and at the end of follow-up, the number of swollen and tender joints, the ESR and CRP and the dosage of prednisone decreased significantly (Table 1). At the end of follow up, only 2 patients still complained of mild arthralgias and none reported systemic symptoms. (Table presented) Conclusion: TCZ is extremely efficacious in adult Still's disease. Although randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm this observation, TCZ should be strongly considered in the treatment of patient with adult Still's disease."

Although patients are treated according to existing guidelines and reach clinical remission, erosive progression still occurs. This demonstrates that additional methods for prognostication and monitoring of the disease activity are needed. Bone marrow edema (BME) detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proved to be an independent predictor of subsequent radiographic progression. Guiding the treatment based on the presence/absence of BME may therefore be clinically beneficial. We present the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to evaluate whether an MRI-guided treatment strategy compared to a conventional treatment strategy in anti-CCP-positive erosive RA is better to prevent progression of erosive joint damage and increase the remission rate in patients with low disease activity or clinical remission. METHODS/DESIGN: the study is a non-blinded, multicenter, 2-year RCT with a parallel group design. Two hundred anti-CCP-positive, erosive RA patients characterized by low disease activity or remission, no clinically swollen joints and treatment with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) will be included. Patients will be randomized to either a treatment strategy based on conventional laboratory and clinical examinations (control group) or a treatment strategy based on conventional laboratory and clinical examinations as well as MRI (intervention group). Treatment is intensified according to a predefined treatment algorithm in case of inflammation defined as a disease activity score (DAS28) >3.2 and at least one clinically swollen joint (control and intervention groups) and/or MRI-detected BME (intervention group only). The primary outcome measures are DAS28 remission (DAS28<2.6) and radiographic progression (Sharp/vdHeijde score). DISCUSSION: the perspectives, strengths and weaknesses of this study are discussed. This study has been approved by The Regional Scientific Ethical Committees for Southern Denmark, S-20110109.

The daily Teorema dose was 420 mg in 21 cases and 210 mg in 3 cases; that of indometacin was 150 mg in 22 cases and 75 mg in 2 cases. Both drugs were given orally as capsules (25 mg indometacin/capsule and 70 mg Teorema/capsule). Both compounds produced a highly significant improvement of symptoms. Laboratory tests at regular intervals failed to reveal any substantial deviations from normal in both treatment groups. In conclusion, the results of the double blind trial suggest that Teorema, a new anti-inflammatory substance, when administered at a dose of approximately 420 mg/day, produces a beneficial effect in many rheumatoid conditions, while causing remarkably few side effects."

Fifty-five women received one of four therapeutic regimens. The periarticular radial bone mineral density (BMD) was analyzed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Generalized osteopenia was assessed by measuring the BMD and height of the lumbar spine (L2-L4). Vertebral deformity was also assessed on plain X-ray film. Physical activity, age and menopausal status were similar among the four treatment groups. The decrease of lumbar BMD was greatest in the group given steroids plus another disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), followed by the steroid/methotrexate group, methotrexate group and the other DMARD group. The decrease of lumbar vertebral height was greatest in the steroid/methotrexate group, followed by the steroid/DMARD group, methotrexate group and the other DMARD group. Vertebral compression was found in 22% of the steroid/methotrexate group and 14% of the steroid/DMARD group. Radial periarticular BMD was significantly lower in patients with active wrist joint synovitis than in patients without synovitis, but was increased by methotrexate therapy. We conclude that low- dose methotrexate did not increase lumbar osteopenia or vertebral compression in RA patients and might prevent periarticular osteopenia by suppressing synovitis."

While there is a broad agreement that patient educational interventions are valuable, their effectiveness at improving adherence is questionable. Objective: this study aimed to assess the impact of different modes of patient education on medication adherence in Thai RA patients. Method: one hundred and twenty RA patients with non-adherence, defined as pill count >80% or medication taking behavior questionnaire for Thai patient (MTB) >23, were randomized by block randomization into multi-component intervention group (MG) or single intervention group (SG). The MG received a 30-min directed counseling and a disease information pamphlet. The SG received only a disease information pamphlet. The primary outcomes were improvement in adherence rate measured by pill count and MTB score after 12 weeks. The clinical trial registry number is TCTR20171207003. Result: after 12 weeks, pill count adherence rate increased significantly from baseline in both groups (MG; 5.38 +/- 12.90, P = 0.002 vs. SG; 3.81 +/- 14.23, P = 0.044). However, the mean difference of adherence rate between both groups were not significant. MTB score improved in MG (1.12 +/- 2.22, P < 0.001), but not in SG (0.44 +/- 2.92, P = 0.251). Clinical outcome including DAS28, EQ-5D, pain score, and physician glo-bal assessment were unchanged from baseline in both groups. Conclusion: patient education significantly improved adherence. However, there were no differences between single education intervention and multi-component education intervention in improving medication adherence"

To screen the possible genetic factors affecting the pharmacokinetics (PK) of talniflumate, 23 male Korean volunteers were enrolled from two separate bioequivalence studies. All subjects received 740 mg (two tablets) talniflumate in a standard 2x2 cross-over model in a randomized order. For the genetic study, PK parameters of the reference drug were used. We used Illumina Human610Quad v1.0 DNA Analysis BeadChip for whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and whole genome genotyping data were processed by linear regression analysis for PK parameters. Whole genome analysis revealed 1498 significant SNPs (P < 0.0001) for Cmax, 65 significant SNPs (P < 0.0001) for Tmax, and 1491 significant SNPs (P < 0.0001) for AUCinf. For clinical pharmacological purposes, we selected SNPs from drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and analyzed the PK parameters of various genotypes. Two SNPs (rs11165069 from ABCA4 (p=0.00002); rs17847036 from CYP2C9 (p=0.000001)) showed significant associations with talniflumate Cmax. In the Tmax group, two SNPs (rs3787555 from CYP24A1 (p=0.00035); rs2275034 from ABCA4 (p=0.000587)) showed significant associations with talniflumate Tmax. In the AUCinf group, two SNPs (rs11165069 from ABCA4 (p=0.00002); rs12461006 from SLC1A6 (p=0.00008)) exhibited significant associations with talniflumate absorption.

9257187,,10.3899/jrheum.130912,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a feasibility study focused on a telemonitoring approach to self-managed kinesiotherapy sessions for the rehabilitation of hand function in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Ten patients with SSc and 10 with RA were enrolled in a 3-month controlled trial (approval no. 9751/2012 - Italian Department of Health) to perform a home kinesiotherapy protocol, consisting of strengthening and mobility exercises, using a newly developed telemedicine system (a portable device and the related telemonitoring infrastructure). A further 10 patients with SSc and 10 with RA were enrolled as controls to perform a similar home kinesiotherapy protocol with the aid of common daily-life objects. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and at followup, after 6 and 12 weeks. The primary outcome of the trial was hand function measured by Dreiser's index (Functional Index for Hand OA, FIHOA), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the Hand Mobility in Scleroderma (HAMIS) test (only for SSc).
RESULTS: Patients with SSc showed an improvement of FIHOA in both arms (p < 0.01) but the HAQ (p = 0.016) and the HAMIS test (right hand p = 0.016, left hand p = 0.075) improved significantly only in the experimental arm. Patients with RA showed a statistically significant improvement of FIHOA (p = 0.013) and HAQ (p = 0.015) in the experimental arm, while patients in the control arm did not significantly improve. However, no statistically significant differences in outcome measures between treatment methods were observed. Withdrawals were higher in control arms (SSc 20%; RA 30%) than in experimental arms (SSc 10%; RA 10%).
CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring of self-administered kinesiotherapy programs is a promising approach to the rehabilitation of hand functions in patients with rheumatic disease."

The central lower tear meniscus radius (TMR) curvature was measured before and at 15‚Äâmin after instillation by video-meniscometry. Simultaneously, all patients self-evaluated their symptoms of wetness and stinging using a visual analog scale (VAS, in millimeters).ResultsTopical instillation of DQS significantly increased the TMR at 15‚Äâmin (mean: 0.21¬±0.08 (SD)‚Äâmm) compared with at baseline (mean: 0.16¬±0.07‚Äâmm) (P<0.001, paired t-test), whereas AT had no effect at baseline (mean: 0.18¬±0.09‚Äâmm) or at 15‚Äâmin (mean: 0.18¬±0.09‚Äâmm).

Patients often have excuses as to why they do not attend these programs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an intervention of televised testimonials from rheumatologists and allied health professionals increases attendance at a multidisciplinary education day for rheumatology patients seen in a large university hospital clinic. This was an RCT of intervention: playing televised interviews in the waiting room where rheumatology patients were seen versus no TV. There was a total of 6 months (3 months with and 3 without the televised interview playing). All eligible patients who attended the rheumatology outpatient clinic were then tracked to determine whether they attended a subsequent education day over the next 10 months. The sample size was calculated to have a 15% increase in attendance at the education days. There was a 20% increase in attendees at the multidisciplinary education days for patients who saw the televised testimonials. Sixty-three patients who viewed the testimonials (2.17% of 2,908) attended the education day compared to 39 who did not receive the intervention (1.80% of 2,168); however, the increase was not statistically significant (p = 0.36). Attendance of eligible patients increased using televised testimonials; however, the increase was not significant as the rates of attendance were still very low in both groups.

Symptoms often occur, due to hard callus arising as a result of increased pressure over the plantar metatarsal head. Sharp scalpel debridement of painful plantar callosities is a standard treatment to relieve discomfort but it carries risks of haemorrhage, ulceration and introduction of infection. Furthermore, debridement is rarely the sole course of treatment; functional orthotic therapy and footwear advice/ provision may also be used. Recently, the short-term benefits of callus reduction for people with RA were called into question. Methods: 65 patients with RA and presenting with painful forefoot plantar callosities for the first time were randomized to receive one of two treatment protocols. The treatment arm comprised regular debridement of painful forefoot plantar callosities in conjunction with mechanical interventions (e.g. orthoses, footwear) while the control arm comprised mechanical interventions alone. The primary outcome was a reduction in pain on a 100mm visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes included health status (Leeds Foot Impact Scale, a diseasespecific scale for measuring the impact of foot disease in 2 domains: impairment/footwear (LFISIF) and activity/participation (LFISAP)), ambulatory function (velocity measured by GAITRite) and complication rates (ulceration, infection). Patients were followed up for 18 months. Results: The mean baseline and 18 month follow-up pain scores were 40.8 and 22.3, respectively, for the treatment group and 53.4 and 34.0, respectively, for the control group. There was no difference between groups in the primary outcome of pain, allowing for differences in baseline scores (F=1.2, p=ns). Mean baseline and follow-up GAITRite velocity scores were 90.1 and 89.8 cm/sec for the treatment group and 85.7 and 88.5 cm/sec for the control group. In the treatment group, mean baseline LFISIF score was 12.2 and follow-up was 11.3, mean baseline LFISAP, was 15.3 and follow-up was 15.7. In the control group, mean baseline LFISIF score was 14.1 and follow-up was 13.2, mean baseline LFISAP, was 18.0 and follow-up was 16.1. Secondary outcomes of health status and ambulatory function also showed no differences between groups. Complication rates were infrequent in both groups. Conclusions: Sharp scapel debridement of painful forefoot plantar callosities in conjunction with mechanical interventions in RA reduced pain, but the effect was no different from the use of mechanical interventions alone. The long-term outcomes were consistent with previous study findings and further question the efficacy of sharp scapel debridement of painful forefoot plantar callosities in people with RA."

Some researchers have suggested that the serum vitamin D (Vit¬†D) level may relate to disease activity. The current study was designed to identify the correlation between vitamin¬†D prescription and prevention of relapses in rheumatoid arthritis.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: a double blinded, randomized controlled trial study was performed using 80¬†RA patients. RA was controlled and patients were in remission during the past 2¬†months. Serum level of Vit¬†D in the studied patients was below 30¬†ng/dl. Patients were randomly allocated to receive Vit¬†D or placebo. In the 6-month follow-up period, the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) was used in case of relapses as an index of RA activity to compare the two groups.
RESULTS: the flare rate was not different between two groups (p‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). The odds ratio of the rate of decline in patients of the trial group compared with the control group was 1.17 (not significant; p‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). The mean DAS28 between the two patient groups was not significant (p‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05).
CONCLUSION: a low Vit¬†D level was not identified to be a risk factor for RA severity or flare ups; however, although not statistically significant, Vit¬†D treatment might be clinically effective. Further studies are needed with more emphasis on the issue of cost effectiveness and clinical importance to provide more information."

A small decrease in rheumatoid factor titer and a small increase in hematocrit were found only in the histidine group. There was suggestive evidence of a beneficial effect of histidine in patients with more active and prolonged disease, based upon subjective doubld-blind evaluations by physicians and patients. No adverse effects of histidine therapy were noted. Histidine cannot be advocated as a therapeutic agent in rheumatoid arthritis, but further studies in certain groups of patients seem justified."

Reducing inflammatory responses may reduce these risks. However, available markers of inflammatory status inadequately describe the complexity of metabolic responses to mild anti-inflammatory therapy.
METHODS: to address this limitation, we used an integrative omics approach to characterize modulation of inflammation in overweight men during an intervention with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. Measured parameters included 80 plasma proteins, >300 plasma metabolites (lipids, free fatty acids, oxylipids and polar compounds) and an array of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene expression products. These measures were submitted to multivariate and correlation analysis and were used for construction of biological response networks.
RESULTS: a panel of genes, proteins and metabolites, including PGE2 and TNF-alpha, were identified that describe a diclofenac-response network (68 genes in PBMC, 1 plasma protein and 4 plasma metabolites). Novel candidate markers of inflammatory modulation included PBMC expression of annexin A1 and caspase 8, and the arachidonic acid metabolite 5,6-DHET.
CONCLUSION: in this study the integrated analysis of a wide range of parameters allowed the development of a network of markers responding to inflammatory modulation, thereby providing insight into the complex process of inflammation and ways to assess changes in inflammatory status associated with obesity.

A matched randomized control group who received a single i.a. injection of 40 mg triamcinolone hexacetonide (TC) was monitored according to the same protocol. The intraarticular granulocyte counts and IL-8 levels decreased in all MTX treated patients on day 10-13 and stayed low in those patients who could be re-evaluated after 13 weeks. Compared to the IL-8 levels, the other tested cytokine levels showed only minor changes on day 10-13. There was no need for re-injection in the TC group during the 13 week study phase. We conclude that intraarticular MTX therapy results in a strong decrease of SF-granulocyte counts. This effect may be due to the impairment of IL-8 mediated chemotaxis by decreased IL-8 synthesis in synovial fluid mononuclear cells. Clinically, repeated intraarticular MTX therapy results in a worse 13 week outcome than i.a. steroid treatment measured in an intention-to-treat analysis."

Females with confirmed RA were randomly assigned to an exercise group (RAE) and a sedentary group (RAC). RAE was required to train under supervision two to three times per week, for 3 months. Three techniques (time domain, frequency domain and Poincare plot analyses) were used to measure HRV at baseline and study completion. At baseline, RAC (n=18) had a significantly higher variability compared to RAE (n=19) for most HRV indicators. At study completion, the variables showing significant changes (p=0.01 to 0.05) favoured RAE in all instances. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to assess changes within groups from start to end. RAE showed significant improvement for most of the standing variables, including measurements of combined autonomic influence, e.g. SDRR (p=0.002) and variables indicating only vagal influence, e.g. pNN50 (p=0.014). RAC mostly deteriorated with emphasis on variables measuring vagal influence (RMSSD, pNN50, SD1 and HF (ms2)). Study results indicated that 12 weeks of exercise intervention had a positive effect on cardiac autonomic function as measured by short-term HRV, in females with RA. Several of the standing variables indicated improved vagal influence on the heart rate. Exercise can thus potentially be used as an instrument to improve cardiac health in a patient group known for increased cardiac morbidity.  The Author(s) 2012."

DESIGN: two year randomised controlled trial extended to six years.
SETTING: rheumatology outpatient department in teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: 209 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis for over two years; 68 (65%) in the direct access group and 52 (50%) in the control group completed the study (P = 0.04).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: clinical outcome: pain, disease activity, early morning stiffness, inflammatory indices, disability, grip strength, range of movement in joints, and bone erosion. Psychological status: anxiety, depression, helplessness, self efficacy, satisfaction, and confidence in the system. Number of visits to hospital physician and general practitioner for arthritis.
RESULTS: participants were well matched at baseline. After six years there was only one significant difference between the two groups for the 14 clinical outcomes measured (deterioration in range of movement in elbow was less in direct access patients). There were no significant differences between groups for median change in psychological status. Satisfaction and confidence in the system were significantly higher in the direct access group at two, four, and six years: confidence 9.8 v 8.4, 9.4 v 8.0, 8.7 v 6.9; satisfaction 9.3 v 8.3, 9.3 v 7.7, 8.9 v 7.1 (all P < 0.02). Patients in the direct access group had 38% fewer hospital appointments (median 8 v 13, P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: over six years, patients with rheumatoid arthritis who initiated their reviews through direct access were clinically and psychologically at least as well as patients having traditional reviews initiated by a physician. They requested fewer appointments, found direct access more acceptable, and had more than a third fewer medical appointments. This radical responsive management could be tested in other chronic diseases."

METHODS: eighty patients with RA were randomly divided into 2 groups, 40 in each group: the treated group treated with TGP and leflunomide, and the control group treated with LEF alone, the therapeutic course for both groups was 12 weeks. Clinical effect after treatment, changes of symptoms and physical signs before and after treatment were observed and the relative laboratory indexes were detected AS well. RESULTS: the total effective rate in the treated group was higher than that in the control group (97.5% vs 85.0%, p < 0.05). The clinical and laboratory indexes in the treated group were improved significantly after treatment (P < 0.05, p < 0.01), with the improvement superior to those in the control group (P < 0.05, p < 0.01) respectively. There was no significant difference in adverse reaction between the two groups. CONCLUSION: combined application of TGP and LEF is superior to using of LEF alone in treating RA, owing to its quicker initiating action and less adverse reaction."

For generic instruments, the states are generally not labelled by disease types to avoid negative perceptions being incorporated in the preferences. Disease-specific utility instruments tend to identify the disease, thereby incorporating any societal perceptions about that disease into the valuation. This study explores whether labelling a health state affects general population valuations. METHODS: an online panel of general population respondents (n = 800) were recruited to complete a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE was designed to evaluate individuals' preferences for different health scenarios pertaining to colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Half the participants were randomly selected to complete a four-attribute DCE (health state before treatment, health state after treatment, duration of life, and disease type). The remaining participants completed an identical DCE except that disease type was excluded. For these respondents, after they completed each choice set they were asked if they would change their answers if the corresponding disease label was applied. For each DCE version, a conditional logit model was used to determine the marginal utility weight for the attribute levels, from which trade-offs and marginal rates of substitution were calculated. RESULTS: relationships between personal utility and all attributes were in the hypothesized direction. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics between those completing either DCE version. When adjusted for the two versions, the labels associated with colorectal cancer (beta = -0.40, SE = 0.04, p<0) and type 2 diabetes (beta = 0.28, SE = 0.04, p<0) had an effect on the responses relative to RA. On average, the respondents were willing to forego 1.58 life-years for a health state to be labelled as diabetes rather than RA. Similarly, they would be willing to forego 2.25 life-years for RA rather than colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: the provision of disease labels influenced general population respondent's valuations for a given health state. There was a clear ordering effect such that respondents preferred to have diabetes over RA, and for RA over colorectal cancer. This raises concerns regarding the use of disease-specific utility instruments for guiding difficult policy decisions"

The aim of this study was to examine if DMARDs, steroids, and biologics for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis (PSO), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) affect BMD. Methods: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane were searched from 1960 to present using English randomised controlled trials in adults. Review articles were excluded. Studies were grouped based on disease, treatment type, and site of BMD measurement (wrist, lumbar spine (LS), hip). Results: 393 studies were identified; 13 were eligible (11 RA, 0 PsA, 0 PSO, 2 AS). For RA, significantly less wrist bone loss was seen with biologics (DBMD = 0.27SD, 95% CI 0.07-0.47, P=0.009, I2=0%) and corticosteroids (DBMD = 0.54SD, 95% CI 0.23-0.85, P=0< 0.001, I2=0%). Biologics had no significant effect on LS and hip BMD. Corticosteroids had more bone loss compared to placebo on LS (DBMD = -0.25SD, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.08, P=0.003, I2=52%) but no difference for hip. For AS, significant BMD increase was seen with biologics in both LS (DBMD = 0.98SD, 95% CI 0.73-1.23, P< 0.001, I2=16%) and hip (DBMD = 0.38SD, 95% CI 0.14-0.63, P=0.002, I2=0%). There was insufficient data to meta-analyze other diseases. DBMD were reported as standardized mean difference. Conclusion: Based on our RA analysis, biologics and steroids yielded less wrist bone loss (where synovitis is often present) but had no effect on hip. Corticosteroids affected more bone loss in LS whereas biologics had no effect on LS. For AS, biologics yielded increase in both LS and hip BMD."

METHODS: Patients with RA (n = 29), suffering from moderate to severe pain for more than 3 months, were included in the study, except those under RA therapy with biological drugs. The treatment started with oxycodone/acetaminophen at the dosage of 5 mg/325 mg, and then the dosage was titrated until the attainment of good pain relief. Antiemetic and laxative therapy was used for the prophylaxis of known opioid-related adverse events.
RESULTS: Patients continued their RA therapy without changing the dosages, reported reduced pain intensity and disease activity, and improvement of disability. Forty-two percent of patients had a good clinical response to oxycodone/acetaminophen treatment, according to European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) assessment criteria, and 50 percent of patients reached the American College of Rheumatology 20 percent improvement criteria (ACR20). At the end of the study, the mean (+/- SD) daily effective oxycodone/acetaminophen dose was 13.8 (+/- 6.8) mg/720.4 (+/- 291.0) mg. No serious adverse event was observed. Nausea, vomiting, and stipsis of mild-moderate intensity were the most common adverse events.
CONCLUSION: Oxycodone/acetaminophen at low dosages for the treatment of chronic pain in RA patients can be a good alternative to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), allowing the reduction of their consumption, while keeping RA therapy stable."

Outcome measures included changes in; airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine (PD20FEV1), daily symptoms and peak expiratory flows (PEF), sputum and blood cell profiles, sputum CysLT and prostaglandin (PG)E2 and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) levels. Methods. A double blind, placebo-controlled study of zafirlukast, 20 mg twice daily over 12 weeks in 21 asthmatics taking beta2-agonists only (Group I), and 24 subjects treated with ICS (Group II). Results. In Group I, zafirlukast significantly improved morning PEF and FEV1compared to placebo (p < 0.01), and reduced morning waking with asthma from baseline after two weeks (p < 0.05). Similarly in Group II, FEV1 improved compared to placebo (p < 0.05), and there were early within-treatment group improvements in morning PEF, beta2-agonist use and asthma severity scores (p < 0.05).

Symptom management and monitoring of the course of the disease over time are important to minimize disability and pain. Poor disease control and anticipation of the need for treatment changes may be prompted by specialist medical follow-up and regular nurse-led consultations with the patient and families, in which information and support is provided. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a nurse-led telephone intervention or Telenursing (TN) compared to standard care (SC) on satisfaction and health outcomes of children with inflammatory rheumatic diseases and their parents.
METHODS: a multicentered, randomized, longitudinal, crossover trial was conducted with pediatrics outpatients newly diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups TN and SC for 12¬†months and crossed-over for the following 12¬†months. TN consisted of providing individualized affective support, health information and aid to decision making. Satisfaction (primary outcome) and health outcomes were assessed with the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 and the Juvenile Arthritis Multidimensional Assessment Report, respectively. A mixed effect model, including a group x time interaction, was performed for each outcome.
RESULTS: satisfaction was significantly higher when receiving TN (OR¬†=¬†7.7, 95% CI: 1.8-33.6). Morning stiffness (OR¬†=¬†3.2, 95% CI: 0.97-7.15) and pain (OR¬†=¬†2.64, 95% CI: 0.97-7.15) were lower in the TN group. For both outcomes a carry-over effect was observed with a higher impact of TN during the 12 first months of the study. The other outcomes did not show any significant improvements between groups.
CONCLUSION: TN had a positive impact on satisfaction and on morning stiffness and pain of children with inflammatory rheumatic diseases and their families. This highlights the importance of support by specialist nurses in improving satisfaction and symptom management for children with inflammatory rheumatisms and their families.

Efficacy of low dose rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to first-line non-biologic Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), compared to leflunomide is unknown. In a tertiary care referral setting, we conducted a randomized, double blind controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of low-dose rituximab-methotrexate combination with leflunomide-methotrexate combination.
METHODS: patients on methotrexate (10-20¬¨‚Ä†mg/week) with a Disease Activity Score (DAS)¬¨‚Ä†>¬¨‚Ä†3.2 were randomly assigned to rituximab (500¬¨‚Ä†mg on days 1 and 15) or leflunomide (10-20¬¨‚Ä†mg/day).

Methods: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 314 subjects with hyperuricemia (serum uric acid [UA] level of >=7.0 mg/dl) and early gout were randomized 1: 1 to receive once-daily febuxostat 40 mg (increased to 80 mg if the serum UA level was >=6.0 mg/dl on day 14) or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was the mean change from baseline to month 24 in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde erosion score for the single affected joint. Additional efficacy end points included change from baseline to month 24 in the Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring (RAMRIS) scores for synovitis, erosion, and edema in the single affected joint, the incidence of gout flares, and serum UA levels. Safety was assessed throughout the study. Results: treatment with febuxostat did not lead to any notable changes in joint erosion over 2 years. In both treatment groups, the mean change from baseline to month 24 in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde erosion score for the single affected joint was minimal, with no between-group differences. However, treatment with febuxostat significantly improved the RAMRIS synovitis score at month 24 compared with placebo treatment (change from baseline -0.43 versus -0.07; P <0.001), decreased the overall incidence of gout flares (29.3% versus 41.4%; P < 0.05), and improved serum UA control (62.8% versus 5.7%; P < 0.001). No major safety concerns were reported.

In this project, we will compare a standardized Iyengar yoga program for young people with rheumatoid arthritis to a standard care wait-list control condition.
METHODS/DESIGN: seventy rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 16-35 years will be randomized into either the 6-week Iyengar yoga program (12 - 1.5 hour sessions twice weekly) or the 6-week wait-list control condition. A 20% attrition rate is anticipated. The wait-list group will receive the yoga program following completion of the first arm of the study. We will collect data quantitatively, using questionnaires and markers of disease activity, and qualitatively using semi-structured interviews. Assessments include standardized measures of general and arthritis-specific function, pain, mood, and health-related quality of life, as well as qualitative interviews, blood pressure/resting heart rate measurements, a medical exam and the assessment of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Data will be collected three times: before treatment, post-treatment, and two months following the treatment.
DISCUSSION: results from this study will provide critical data on non-pharmacologic methods for enhancing function in rheumatoid arthritis patients. In particular, results will shed light on the feasibility and potential efficacy of a novel intervention for rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, paving the way for a larger clinical trial.

This work characterized the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of ABT-494 following single and multiple dosing of the immediate-release formulation. Methods: aBT-494 single (1-48 mg or placebo; n = 56) and multiple (3-24 mg or placebo twice daily for 14 days; n = 44) doses in healthy subjects, as well as multiple doses (3-24 mg or placebo twice daily for 27 days; n = 14) in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on a background of methotrexate were evaluated. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected and safety and tolerability were assessed. Results: aBT-494 followed bi-exponential disposition, with a terminal elimination half-life of 6-16 h and a functional half-life, calculated from maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) to trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) ratio at steady state, of 3-4 h. ABT-494 exposure was approximately dose proportional over the 3-36 mg dose range, with no significant accumulation with repeated dosing. In subjects with RA, no pharmacokinetic interaction between ABT-494 and methotrexate was observed. The fraction of ABT-494 dose eliminated in urine as unchanged ABT-494 was 14-25 %. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate in severity, with headache being the most frequently observed TEAE (15.6 % for ABT-494 vs. 16.7 % for placebo) after multiple twice-daily administration to healthy subjects. No clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, or electrocardiogram findings in healthy or RA subjects were observed.

To evaluate the initial serological responses to pneumococcal vaccination with the 13-valent protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) followed by the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23) among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD) according to dosing and intervals between immunizations. Methods. Investigator-initiated clinical trial. Patients with RA receiving bDMARD were randomized (1: 1: 1) to immunization with single dose PCV13 followed by PPV23 after 16 or 24 weeks, or double dose PCV13 followed by PPV23 after 16 weeks. A comparison group of patients with RA treated with conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD received single dose PCV13 followed by PPV23 16 weeks later. Pneumococcal antibodies were collected before and 4 weeks after each vaccination. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants responding to 7ge; 6/12 pneumococcal serotypes 4 weeks after both vaccinations. Results. Sixty-five participants receiving bDMARD and 35 participants receiving csDMARD were included. After PPV23 vaccination, 87% (95% CI 0.76-0.94) and 94% (95% CI 0.77-0.99), respectively, of participants treated with bDMARD and csDMARD had reached the primary endpoint. There was no significant difference in primary endpoint between the 3 randomization arms. The response for rituximab-treated participants was 25% compared to >= 89% in participants treated with bDMARD with other mode of action. Conclusion. The early serological response to prime-boost vaccination with PCV13 followed by PPV23 was very similar among participants receiving bDMARD and csDMARD. However, notable differences in response were observed according to individual bDMARD. It is important to consider the RA treatment when planning pneumococcal vaccination in patients with RA.

Due to biological medical treatment there is increased outcome of the disease with less flares and arthritis. Impaired bone health, muscle strength and decreased well-being have been reported in this group. There is evidence for intervention studies with cardiovascular fitness, physical fitness and muscle strength exercises for increased outcome of the disease.The aim was to evaluate an exercise programme in children and adolescents before and after 12 weeks with rope-skipping and muscle strength exercises and to evaluate the effect on bone health, muscle strength, physical fitness and well-being. Objectives: 54 subjects participated, age 9-21 years, randomized into an exercise and a control group. Methods: A randomized controlled study. DXA, grip-it, myometry, physical fitness and the questinnares CHAQ and CHQ were used. The exercise group performed the exercise programme in 12 weeks and physical activity in leisure time was documented in two 12-week diaries for both groups. Results: Bone health was within the normal in this group at base line and there were no differences between the exercise and the control group. Bone health, calculated as BMD increased in the exercise group after 12 weeks. Muscles strength showed values within the normal. Muscle weakness was found in hip extensors and hip abductors at base line and increased after the training period. Muscle weakness in the hand was shown in > 50% of the participants and there was no change during the study. Muscle strength in quadriceps was within the normal, increase after 12 weeks exercise and was maintained at follow-up. Pain and wellbeing were reported in the group. Conclusion: Bone health and muscle strength were within normal range at base line except in hip extensors, hip abductors and in hand grip strength. Muscle strength in knee extensors increased and was maintained at followup. Muscle strength training with free weights and rope skipping (100 jumps 3 times/ week in twelve weeks) increase BMD and muscle strength and can be recommended for children and adolescents with JIA. The presence of pain was reported from many children and needs to be addressed in view of pain in itself, and in view of the consequences of pain on well-being in psychosocial terms."

Although impairments are most pronounced in children with disease activity, deficits like fatigue, decreased physical activity, low aerobic and anaerobic exercise remain impaired long after disease control is obtained. Exercise and physical activity (PA) can be seen as a type of behaviour. Therefore we expect that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could be a successful approach to improve exercise capacity and PA levels in children with JIA. To increase PA levels in children with JIA an internet-based program has been developed. A pilot showed to be effective in improving PA and exercise capacity in children with JIA. Objectives: The aim of this multicenter study is to explore the efficacy of an internet based cognitive behavioural intervention Rheumates@work on PA and exercise capacity. Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial. Patients with JIA aged 8-12 year, with access to internet were selected for this study. PA was measured with a 7-day activity diary and an Actical accelerometer. PA level was categorized by time spend on moderate to vigorous PA and the number of days with 1 hour of moderate to vigorous PA. Aerobic exercise capacity was assessed by the Bruce treadmill test expressed by walking time. Disease activity was assessed by using the JIA core set. Adherence was electronically monitored. Patients with low physical activity defined as equal to or less than three days of one hour of moderate to vigorous PA or with a low exercise capacity defined as less than P5 on the Bruce treadmill test were included. Results: Out of 83 selected patients, 49 eligible patients were included and randomized in the intervention (n = 28) and control waiting list group (n = 21). Adherence was good 26 out of 28 patients (93%) completed the program. The intervention group improved significantly in exercise capacity (p.01), and in number of minutes spend on vigorous activity (p.00). The control group did not improve significant. Disease activity did not increase in both groups. Conclusion: Preliminary results show that the internet based cognitive behavioural program rheumates@work was effective in improving exercise capacity and stimulated the patients to be more vigorously active. Rheumates@work is safe to administer."

Objectives: To use statistical methods to estimate the relative efficacy of biologic treatments, alone and in combination with methotrexate (MTX), in the management of pcJIA by means of indirect comparison of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Based on a literature review, we identified RCTs of abatacept, adalimumab (ADA), etanercept, infliximab and tocilizumab (TCZ) in pcJIA. Comparative effectiveness was estimated on the reported American College of Rheumatology response rates (JIA ACR30/50/70/90) measured at the end of the randomised, double-blind phase by means of a Bayesian indirect comparison using a fixed-effects ordered probit model. Probabilities of achieving different levels of JIA ACR response were calculated for biologic treatments and placebo using all observed comparisons. Results: The 5 RCTs identified showed differences in reporting JIA ACR responses with regard to methods of non-responder imputation during the blinded, controlled phase, allowing only for the comparison of ADA and TCZ. In the base-case analysis, for a JIA ACR30 placebo response of 31%, TCZ monotherapy had a higher predicted probability of JIA ACR30 (62%), JIA ACR50 (59%), JIA ACR70 (54%) and JIA ACR90 (35%) response than ADA monotherapy (53%, 49%, 44% and 26%, respectively). On MTX background therapy and a JIA ACR30 placebo response of 53%, ADA had a higher expected probability of response at JIA ACR30 (76%), JIA ACR50 (75%), JIA ACR70 (66%) and JIA ACR90 (49%) than TCZ (72%, 70%, 61% and 44%, respectively). In neither monotherapy nor combination therapy did differences between TCZ and ADA reach statistical significance. Differences in the study populations, including previous use of biologics, were explored with sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: Based on JIA ACR response rates from this analysis, the expected efficacy of ADA vs TCZ appears comparable in pcJIA. These data should be interpreted in the context of differences in the duration of the withdrawal phase, which was shorter in the TCZ study (CHERISH) than in the ADA trial and might have resulted in a smaller difference in the number of flares observed between placebo and TCZ. Differences in previous exposure to biologics might also have affected the results."

The most frequent reason for not reaching remission remains the Patient Global Disease Activity (PGA) score; about a third of current patients are in Quasi-Remission (all components of ACR Boolean remission <=1 except PGA). PGA strongly correlates with Pain, Fatigue, Functional limitations and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) may be effective to address the full array of RA patients' symptoms. Our objective is to evaluate the impact of MBSR on depressive symptoms, pain, fatigue, PGA and disease activity in RA patients with controlled clinical inflammation. Methods: support was obtained from CIORA for a pilot study. Approval was obtained from the CHUS Ethics committee. RA patients (from a pool of =2000 followed at the CHUS) seen during regular follow up are evaluated for controlled disease (<=2 SJC under stable treatment) and for depressive symptoms (Center for Evaluation Studies-Depression (CES-D) >= 16). Participation to group MBSR (8 weekly sessions plus an additional day session) aiming at improving depressive symptoms is offered. Consenting patients will be randomized to a control (standard care) or MBSR group. Questionnaires (pain, fatigue, function, coping, anxiety, depression), Simple Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and serum and saliva samples will be collected at baseline and at 6 months. Qualitative analysis of hurdles and facilitators of patient participation is planned at the end of the MBSR session. At 6 months, patients in the control group will be offered the MBSR intervention. Follow-up post-MBSR is planned every 6 months up to 24 months. Results: about 15% of RA patients with <=2 SJC and stable antirheumatic treatment report a CES-D score >= 16. As expected, the CES-D score correlates with PGA, Pain and Fatigue levels. Recruitment is currently ongoing with a target of 30 patients (15 in each group). Results at 6 months of the first MBSR group and patient feedback on patient recruitment strategies will be available at the time of the annual meeting. Conclusion: the need for an intervention to address persistent symptoms in RA patients with controlled inflammatory disease is real, although many patients appear reluctant to participate in a time-consuming intervention aimed primarily at improving depressive symptoms. Pending the results of the qualitative analysis, our experience suggests that putting more emphasis on Pain, Fatigue, Anxiety and Quality of life may be more appealing to patients. This may affect the recruitment strategy for the next MBSR groups"
9257403,,10.2169/internalmedicine.35.478,"The effect of octylphthalide (OP) bathing was compared with placebo bathing on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A liquid containing octylphthalide was dissolved in water of 40degreeC at a concentration of 10 ppm. A liquid which has quite similar appearance and perfume to the above was used as a placebo. Double blind controlled study tests were performed. Twenty patients (10 for OP bathing and 10 for placebo bathing) were tested by single bathing, 33 other patients (16 patients for OP bathing and 17 for placebo bathing), by serial bathing for 30 days (once a day). After a single bathing, while grip strengths, tender joints scores, and 20 m walking time improved significantly in the OP bathing group, only tender joint scores and 20 m walking time improved significantly in the placebo bathing group. After serial bathing for 30 days, tender joint scores improved significantly in the OP bathing group, but no improvement was observed in the placebo bathing group. The above results suggest that OP bathing may be beneficial for RA patients, but further study may be needed. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved."

In the present study, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model was applied to compare the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib in Japanese and Caucasians to assess the potential impact of ethnicity on the dosing regimen in the two populations. Simulated plasma concentration profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters, i.e. maximum concentration and area under plasma concentration-time curve, in Japanese and Caucasian populations after single or multiple doses of 1 to 30 mg tofacitinib were in agreement with clinically observed data. The similarity in simulated exposure between Japanese and Caucasian populations supports the currently approved dosing regimen in Japan and the United States, where there is no recommendation for dose adjustment according to race. Simulated results for single (1 to 100 mg) or multiple doses (5 mg twice daily) of tofacitinib in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2C19, an enzyme which has been shown to contribute in part to tofacitinib elimination and is known to exhibit higher frequency in Japanese compared to Caucasians, were also in support of no recommendation for dose adjustment in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. This study demonstrated a successful application of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling in evaluating ethnic sensitivity in pharmacokinetics at early stages of development, presenting its potential value as an efficient and scientific method for optimal dose setting in the Japanese population."

METHODS: investigation of productivity costs was linked to a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of clinical quality management in 338 patients with RA. The productivity losses were assessed according to the German Guidelines on Health Economic Evaluation. By means of multivariate logistic regression analyses, predictors of sick leave, work disability (employed patients, n=96), and for days confined to bed in unemployed patient (n=242) were determined.
RESULTS: mean annual costs of 970 EUR arose per person taking into consideration all patients (453 EUR sick leave, 63 EUR work disability, 454 EUR impaired productivity of unemployed patients). Disease activity, disease severity, and impaired physical function were global predictors for all of the cost components investigated. Sick leave costs were predicted by prior sick leave periods and the vocational status blue collar worker, work disability costs by sociodemographic variables (marital status, schooling), and the productivity costs of unemployed patients by impaired mental health and impaired physical functions.
CONCLUSIONS: interventions such as reduction in disease progression and control of disease activity, early vocational rehabilitation measures and vocational retraining in patients at risk of quitting working life, and self-management programs to learn coping strategies might decrease future RA-related productivity costs."
9257414,,10.3899/jrheum.160051,"Objective. To differentiate predictive factors for sustained clinical remission between elderly and younger patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving abatacept (ABA) as an initial biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. Methods. The study involved 277 biologic-naive patients with RA with high or moderate disease activity, who were treated with intravenous ABA and evaluated for 48 weeks in 43 Japanese hospitals and rheumatology clinics (the ABatacept Research Outcomes as a First-line Biological Agent in the Real WorlD study: uMIN000004651). Predictive factors associated with sustained clinical remission defined by the 28-joint Disease Activity Score with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) during the 24-48-week or 36-48-week periods were determined in elderly (? 65 yrs, n = 148) and younger patient groups (< 65 yrs, n = 129) using logistic regression analysis. Results. Clinical remission was achieved at 24 and 48 weeks in 35.1% and 36.5% of patients in the elderly group and 34.9% and 43.4% in the younger group, respectively. In elderly patients, anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positivity and a lower DAS28-CRP score were significantly associated with sustained clinical remission; however, a lower Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-Di) score was not related to sustained clinical remission. In younger patients, lower DAS28-CRP and HAQ-Di scores were predictive factors for sustained clinical remission, whereas ACPA positivity was not a useful predictive factor for sustained clinical remission. Conclusion.Although the effectiveness of ABA in biologic-naive patients with RA was equally recognized in elderly and younger patients, the baseline clinical characteristics associated with sustained clinical remission were substantially different"

Methods: for the present clinical study 15 patients of Amavata (RA) were registered from the Outpatient Department, PG Department of Kayachikitsa, Rishikul Campus, Haridwar. Saindhavadi Taila Matra Vasti was given 60 ml once daily for 8 days, followed by an interval of 7 days. Again Vasti was given once daily for 8 days followed by gap of 7 days. Same cycle was repeated next month. Assessment of the patients was done on the basis of subjective, objective, and functional parameters at the interval of 15 days. Results: statistically significant result was found in subjective parameters such as pain intensity, Sandhishotha, Gaurav, Apaka (p<0.01 in each), Jwara, Aruchi, and Utsahahani (p<0.05 in each). Statistically non-significant result was found in all the functional parameters (p>0.05), that is, in grip strength, foot pressure, and goniometry. In biochemical parameters, statistically significant result was found in erythrocyte sedimentation rate only (p<0.05). Although non-significant result was found in other biochemical parameters such as hemoglobin, RA factor, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, the mean scores of RA factor and CRP were reduced from 48.7 IU/ml and 10.4 mg/L before treatment to 25.8 IU/ml, 8.2 mg/L after treatment, respectively. Conclusion: in the clinical study, patients got symptomatic relief in many of the complaints but no significant result was found in functional parameters and most of the biochemical parameters. Thus, it can be concluded that Saindhavadi Taila Matra Vasti alone is effective in mild-to-moderate cases of Amavata (RA) and in severe cases it can be used along with oral Ayurvedic formulations for better results.

METHODS: data collection was embedded in a multicentre randomised controlled trial in which the cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary job retention vocational rehabilitation programme for employees with chronic arthritis and a disease related problem at work was compared to usual outpatient care. Sick leave (complete or partial) was defined as absenteeism reported to the employer and permanent job loss as receiving a full work disability pension or unemployment. The association between sick leave at baseline and job loss after 24 months was investigated by multivariate logistic regression analysis, including those variables that were univariately significantly associated with job loss after 24 months.
RESULTS: at baseline, 60 of the 112 subjects (54%) were on sick leave, with a mean duration of 18.7 weeks, in half of these patients the sick leave was complete. After 24 months, 26 of the 112 patients (23%) had lost their job. The presence of complete sick leave (OR 4.74, 95% CI 1.86-12.07) and the depression score of the hospital anxiety and depression scale (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.36) were significantly and independently associated with job loss after 2 years follow-up.
CONCLUSION: the occurrence of complete sick leave was found to be an independent risk factor for job loss in patients with chronic arthritis who have a disease related problem at work."

We now extend, and report the long-term results of that study. In the crossover trial, patients were randomized to spa therapy first group or control first group (first assignment, period 1, 6¬†months); after this period and washout phase (9¬†months), they crossed over to the other arm (second assignment, period 2, 6¬†months). In this long-term study, we now analyze the 15-month results of the first assignment, and 12-month results of the second assignment in the opposite side with a 6-month extension of the follow-up period. The clinical outcome measures were pain, patient and physician global assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire, and Disease Activity Score-28. The 15-month results of first assignment revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the efficacy outcomes (p‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05 for all). The 12-month results for the second assignment after crossover revealed a statistically significant decrease between the groups regarding the patient global assessment scores (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.016), physician global assessment scores (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003) and swollen joints counts (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.030); however, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups in any of the other efficacy outcomes (p‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05 for all). The short- and medium-term beneficial effects of the 2-week spa therapy added to the usual pharmacotherapy observed through the initial 6-month evaluation period may be maintained mildly to moderately to the 12-month mark in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed for the confirmation of the study results."

METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with defined RA were included in this placebo controlled, randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Of the 48 women and 10 men (mean age 54.5 years), 25 were functional class II and 31 were class III, with 9 years' disease duration; the mean of previous disease modifying antirheumatic drugs was 4; 49 were taking steroids (mean dosage 11 mg/day of prednisone). Eighty percent were rheumatoid factor positive. All were in an active state of the disease with: pain > 4 (mean at inclusion 6.6), tender joints > 4 (mean 12), swollen joint count > 3 (mean 9), morning stiffness > 45 min (mean 185), erythrocyte sedimentation rate > 30 mm (mean 59) or C-reactive protein (CRP) > 30 mg/l (mean 63). Treatment was randomized between murine anti-CD4 Mab (B-F5, Diaclone, 20 mg/day) or placebo intravenously for 10 consecutive days. Efficacy was assessed with a composite index (Paulus), with evaluation of number of patients with 20 or 50% improvement in each group. Changes in measures of single clinical or biological variables were also evaluated.
RESULTS: The 2 groups were comparable at inclusion. Treatment was well tolerated. Mild side effects (chills, fever, rash) were seen in both groups. Percentage of patients with global 20 or 50% response did not differ between placebo and Mab groups at Day 10 or at Day 30. Evaluation of single variables showed reduced CRP, swollen joint count, and Ritchie index in some B-F5 patients at Day 10, although in the B-F5 group as a whole only CRP was significant.
CONCLUSION: No significant improvement in RA after murine anti-CD4 Mab was observed."

The 1995 preliminary ACR response criteria for improvement were applied to evaluate individual clinical responses.
RESULTS: Two patients in the placebo group (n = 29), 7 patients in the CyA 1.25 mg group (n = 29), and 8 patients in the CyA 2.50 mg group (n = 30) (p = 0.06) discontinued study medication prematurely for inefficacy or adverse events. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed that the tender joint count decreased 2.2 +/- 6.1 (mean +/- SD) joints in the placebo group, 2.2 +/- 6.6 joints in the CyA 1.25 mg group, and 5.0 +/- 5.8 joints in the CyA 2.50 mg group (p = 0.04). The 1995 preliminary ACR response criteria for clinical improvement were met by 8 (28%) patients in the placebo group, 10 (34%) patients in the CyA 1.25 mg group, and 15 (50%) patients in the CyA 2.50 mg group (p = 0.07). The serum creatinine increased 2 +/- 7 micromol/l in the placebo group, decreased 1 +/- 8 micromol/l in the CyA 1.25 mg group, and increased 10 +/- 15 micromol/l in the CyA 2.50 mg group (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The addition of low dose CyA is moderately effective in patients with early RA already treated with low dose chloroquine, but results in statistically significant renal function loss."

METHODS: Patients enrolled in an industry-sponsored, multicentre clinical trial (NCT00784719) were assessed prospectively for the presence of SS. Ocular testing included Schirmer test, corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival lissamine green staining, and tear-film breakup time. Review of systems questionnaire, medical history, dry eye questionnaire and laboratory work-up (Sj√∂gren-specific antibody A (SSA), Sj√∂gren-specific antibody B (SSB), rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibody (ANA)) were obtained.
RESULTS: Of 327 patients, 38 (11.6%) had SS: 21 (6.4%) with primary SS (pSS), and 17 (5.2%) with secondary SS. Nine patients (3%) were newly diagnosed using the applied diagnostic criteria based on American-European consensus criteria. Patients with SS had significantly worse conjunctival and corneal staining, Schirmer test (with and without anaesthesia), and symptoms compared with patients without SS. pSS Was significantly more likely to occur in patients with positive ANA (OR: 13.9) and RF (OR: 4.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists caring for patients with clinically significant dry eye should have a high index of suspicion for underlying SS and low threshold for serological work-up. RF and ANA are recommended as useful tests in SSA/SSB-negative patients for further diagnostic referral."

The aim of this study was to assess the oxidative status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis WHO used concentrated fish oil only or concentrated fish oil in combination with evening primrose oil in a period of 3 months. Subjects were divided into three groups. The group I consists of patients WHO had been taking only their regular rheumatologic therapy; group II, patients WHO had been taking concentrated fish oil; and group III, patients WHO had been taking concentrated fish oil and evening primrose oil. Peripheral blood samples were used for all the assays. We assessed the following oxidative stress markers: index of lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)), hydrogen peroxide (h2o2), superoxide anion radical (o2-), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), and glutathione levels (GSH) in erythrocytes. There were no statistically significant changes for any of the oxidative stress parameters in group I. In group II, levels of TBARS, no2-, and GSH were increased, while levels of h2o2 decreased. Increased values of TBARS, no2-, and SOD were found in group III. Our findings indicate that intakes of fish oil and evening primrose oil may BE of importance in mitigation of inflammation, disease activity, and oxidative stress biomarkers, through increased activities of antioxidant enzymes"

Reports suggest that infliximab (IFX) may be associated with life-threatening tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias.We evaluated the prevalence of cardiac rhythm disorders during acute infusion of IFX in a prospective, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of patients with chronic arthritis. Effects of the drug on measures of arrhythmia risk such as QT interval and heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated. Methods. Seventy-five patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA; n = 55) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) underwent an ambulatory 12-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) recording to monitor cardiac arrhythmias, QT interval, and HRV during the infusion of IFX and saline (placebo). Results. The occurrence of both tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias was not statistically different during IFX or placebo infusion. During IFX infusion, new-onset ventricular tachyarrhythmias had an 8% incidence (2.7% with placebo; OR 3.17, 95% CI 0.61-16.26) and were more severe. In these patients, mainly with RA, baseline-corrected QT interval and HRV values were significantly prolonged and depressed, respectively, in comparison with subjects without such arrhythmias. IFX acutely produced a significant shift toward a relative vagal prevalence without affecting QT interval measurements. Conclusion. New-onset cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachyarrhythmias, developed during IFX infusion, but their incidence did not achieve statistical significance.We identified some specific risk factors possibly characteristic of the small subset of patients with a higher risk for ventricular arrhythmias. The acute effects of IFX on autonomic balance may substantiate the role of the complex interaction between autonomic nervous system and inflammation during chronic arthritis.

9257512,,10.33590/emjrheumatol/10314940,"Background/Purpose: cR6086 is a potent and selective antagonist of the prostaglandin EP4 receptor. EP4 receptors have a role in T-cell differentiation and expansion, and thus in the altered immune response in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. EP4 receptors are then a rational target for novel DMARDs/immunomodulators with added antiinflammatory properties. Indeed, when oral CR6086 was tested in a series of widely accepted models of arthritis in rodents, it was at least as effective as biological DMARDs in all parameters examined, including edema, clinical arthritis score, and histology. The present first-in-human study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CR6086 in single ascending doses. Methods: oral doses of CR6086 ranging from 5 to 300 mg were administered to healthy men in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled fashion. Each of the nine cohorts comprised 6 volunteers on active and 2 on placebo. Food interaction was assessed at 150 mg. Results: cR6086 was well tolerated up to 300 mg, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached.The few observed adverse events where mild or moderate in severity, all resolved spontaneously, and their incidence was not dose-related. The pharmacokinetics of CR6086 were dose-independent, with mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) ranging from 90 to 8151 ng/mL and occurring between 1 and 1.75 h after administration. The extent of bioavailability (AUC) ranged from 602 to 68200 ng.h/mL and a high fat meal did not affect CR6086 bioavailability. Plasma protein binding was around 95% (unbound fraction; fu = 0.0564) and CR6086 did not invert into its antipode. CR6086 elimination half-life averaged 13 h and urinary excretion of the unchanged drug was a minor elimination route. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CR6086 (Figure) were above the Ki for the human EP4 receptor (adjusted for plasma protein binding) already at a dose of 15 mg. From the 100 mg dose, the plasma concentrations of CR6086 were higher than the adjusted Ki for a 24-hour period. A comparison with the exposure in rodents indicated that from the single dose of 30 mg, the exposure is pharmacologically relevant in humans. Conclusion: cR6086 was safe up to the maximum tested dose of 300 mg. The compound is characterized by doseindependent pharmacokinetics producing therapeutically relevant concentrations at well tolerated doses in support for further clinical development as a novel DMARD.

9257529,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/ar2078/fulltext.html,10.1186/ar2078,"OBJECTIVE: Adenosine exerts antiinflammatory effects via activation of the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR), a Gi protein-associated cell-surface receptor, overexpressed in synovial tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CF101 is a highly specific orally bioavailable A3AR agonist.
METHODS: This was a multicenter study, blinded to dose, designed to assess the clinical activity and safety of CF101 in active RA. Seventy-four patients were randomized to receive 0.1, 1.0, or 4.0 mg CF101 bid for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was American College of Rheumatology 20% response (ACR20) at Week 12. A3AR expression levels were analyzed in PBMC from 18 patients.
RESULTS: . Maximal responses were observed with 1.0 mg bid, lower at 0.1 and 4.0 mg bid. At 12 weeks, 55.6%, 33.3%, and 11.5% of the patients receiving 1.0 mg CF101 achieved ACR20%, 50%, and 70% responses, respectively. CF101 was generally well tolerated, with mild headache (4.1%), nausea (2.7%), and rash (2.7%) being the most common treatment-related adverse events. Statistically significant correlations between A3AR overexpression at baseline and ACR50 and ACR70 responses were observed.
CONCLUSION: CF101 administered bid for 12 weeks resulted in improvement in signs and symptoms of RA that did not achieve statistical significance, and was safe and well tolerated. The expression level of A3AR was directly correlated with patient responses to CF101, suggesting its utilization as a biomarker for the pharmacodynamic and therapeutic effects of this novel agent. These findings require confirmation in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, currently under way."

Patients received either cemented (219 patients, 277 implants) or cementless (177 patients, 224 implants) fixation. Altogether, 44 of 501 knees (8.8%) underwent revision surgery (24 cemented vs 20 cementless). For cemented knees the 15-year survival rate was 80.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71.5 to 87.4) and for cementless knees it was 75.3% (95% CI 63.5 to 84.3). There was no significant difference between the two groups (cemented vs cementless; hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.52, p = 0.55). When comparing the covariates there was no significant difference in the rates of survival between the side of operation (HR 0.58, p = 0.07), age (HR 0.97, p = 0.10) and diagnosis (HR 1.25 p = 0.72). However, there was a significant gender difference, with males having a higher failure rate with cemented fixation (HR 2.48, p = 0.004). Females had a similar failure rate in both groups. This single-surgeon series, with no loss to follow-up, provides reliable data of the revision rates of one of the most commonly-used total knee replacements. The survival of the press-fit condylar total knee replacement remained good at 15 years, irrespective of the method of fixation."

9257546,,10.3899/jrheum.150613.c1,"Background/Purpose: cC-292 is a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), which is a component of the B cell receptor signaling complex found in B lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Btk plays a crucial role in B cell development, maturation, and function. CC-292 inhibits Btk activity by irreversible covalent binding with high affinity to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of Btk. Inhibition of Btk could regulate inflammation in RA by two different mechanisms; by blocking B cell receptor-dependent B cell proliferation and the reduction of autoantibody levels, and by inhibiting Fc gamma receptor (FcgammaR)-induced TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 production in macrophages. CC-292 was evaluated over a 4 week treatment period in female subjects with active RA on background methotrexate (MTX) (NCT01975610). Methods: 47 adult female RA subjects were randomized 1: 1 CC-292 375 mg PO daily or placebo (PBO). Subjects were required to have a diagnosis of sero-positive RA for at least 6 months, meeting the 2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria for RA. The RA must have been active despite at least 3 months of treatment with MTX and on a stable dose (7.5 to 25 mg/week oral or parenteral) for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. Permitted concomitant RA medications included sulfasalazine, antimalarials, and low dose corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent < 10 mg/day). Results: cC-292 showed ACR20 (primary endpoint) improvement in 10 (42%) of 24 RA subjects vs. 5 (22%) of 23 RA subjects on placebo. ACR20 improvement separated from placebo as early as week 1, and progressed through week 4. This positive trend was not considered statistically significant (p=0.25). The magnitude of ACR20 difference of 20% between treatment groups at 4 weeks, although not statistically significant, is on par with the effect seen in RA with other DMARDs. There were numerical trends for ACR50 and ACR70 favoring CC-292. No trends for improvement were observed for the exploratory endpoints of DAS28, HAQ-DI, or swollen and tender joint counts. Pharmacodynamic measurement of Btk occupancy showed no free Btk in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells as early as week 1. CC-292 reduced osteoclast activity, reduced B-cell lymph node trafficking, reduced class switched and activated memory B-cell, and increased mature naive B-cells. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were comparable across both treatment arms. The most frequently reported TEAEs (> 5% subjects) in the CC-292 arm were nausea, back pain, diarrhea, cough, and migraine. There were no deaths in the study. There were no serious TEAEs and one severe TEAE of stomatitis. Conclusion: the study did not meet its primary endpoint of improvement in ACR20 at 4 weeks, nor the secondary endpoints of ACR50 and ACR70 at 4 weeks, although there were numerical trends combined with a responder sub-group analysis suggest potential efficacy of CC-292 in this female subject RA population. In this study, CC-292 was well tolerated and had a favorable safety profile over 4 weeks of treatment. CC292 BTK inhibition impacts RA with a different MOA and profile than current therapies"
9257574,,10.1136/bmj.l67,"Background/Purpose: three non-TNF targeted biologics - rituximab, abatacept, and tocilizumab - are widely used, notably in TNF-IR patients. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the drugs in common practice. Methods: this was a multicenter open-label observational study of patients with RA according to 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria who were initiating rituximab, abatacept, or tocilizumab treatment and enrolled in three French Society of Rheumatology prospective registries (AIR for rituximab, ORA for abatacept, and REGATE for tocilizumab). Severe adverse events (death, serious infection, major adverse cardiovascular events, and cancer) were validated by chart review by three experts. The primary outcome was drug retention without failure at month 24. Failure was defined as all-cause death; rituximab, abatacept, or tocilizumab discontinuation; initiation of a new biologic or a combination of conventional DMARDs; or increase in corticosteroid dose greater than 10 mg/day compared to baseline at two successive visits. We used a propensity-score approach to adjust for differences in observed factors that might affect both treatment assignment and outcome. Results: in total, 4,498 patients (abatacept: 1,016, rituximab: 1,984, and tocilizumab: 1,498) were enrolled in the registries, with a follow-up of 18,898 patient-years (abatacept: 4,912, rituximab: 10,545, and tocilizumab: 3,441). Among the 4498 enrolled patients (median disease duration: 11  years, 83.3% of patients previously treated with a biologic, median number of prior of anti-TNF 2 [1; 3]), 3,507 patients had a follow-up at month 24. At month 24, 64.6% of patients [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 61.1; 68.5] were still receiving rituximab without failure, 40.0% [95% CI: 36.0; 45.0] abatacept, and 61.3% [95% CI; 54.9; 68.8] tocilizumab (Figure 1). Drug retention without failure was significantly greater with rituximab and tocilizumab than abatacept (hazard ratio 2.00 [95% CI: 1.65; 2.43]; p<0.001, and 1.82 [95% CI: 1.37; 2.41], p<0.001, respectively), with no difference between rituximab and tocilizumab. Concordant results were observed in six sensitivity analyses. At month 60, drug retention without failure was significantly greater with rituximab than abatacept (48.1% [95% CI: 44.3; 52.5] and 21.0% [95% CI: 18.1; 24.6], respectively, HR 2.06 [95% CI: 1.78; 2.39]; p<0.001). At month 24, 513 patients (6.7/100 patient-years) had experienced at least one of the adverse events of specific interest including serious infection, MACE, cancer, or death: 255 in the rituximab registry (7.3/100 patientyears), 116 in the abatacept registry (6.4/100 patient-years), and 142 in the tocilizumab registry (6.0/100 patient/years) (IRR abatacept versus rituximab: 0.79 [0.56;1.12], p=0.19; IRR tocilizumab versus rituximab: 0.87 [0.58;1.32], p=0.52; IRR abatacept versus tocilizumab 0.91 [0.57;1.47], p=0.71). Conclusion: among patients followed up in common practice with long-standing RA, mostly refractory to at least one previous biologic, the effectiveness at two years seems lower for abatacept than rituximab and tocilizumab. Safety of the three drugs seems similar. (Figure presented)"

9257585,,10.1136/bmj.l67,"Background/Purpose: seropositivity for RF or ACPA is associated with a better short-term effectiveness and drug retention of abatacept (ABA) and rituximab (RTX). Data are very limited concerning the association with long term retention in real life and concerning the association between seropositivity and effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ). Methods: this was a pre-specified sub-group analysis of a multicenter open-label observational study of patients with RA according to 1987 ACR criteria who were initiating RTX, ABA, or TCZ treatment and enrolled in three French Society of Rheumatology prospective registries (AIR for RTX, ORA for ABA, and REGATE for TCZ). Seropositivity was defined by positivity of either RF or anti-CCP. We used a propensity-score approach to adjust for differences in observed factors that might affect both treatment assignment and outcome. Results: data on seropositivity were available in 3540 patients out of 4498 patients(87.4%). 72, 76.7 and 80.9% of patients respectively treated with ABA, RTX and TCZ, had RF or ACPA. 3507 patients had a follow-up at 24 months for a total follow-up of 18898 patient-years (RTX, 10545; ABA, 4912; and TCZ, 3441). - Effect of seropositivity on the effectiveness of each drug Drug retention without failure of RTX at 2 years was 68.7% in seropositive patients and 51.9 [45.6;59.1]% in seronegative patients, HR of discontinuation of 0.56 [0.46;0.69], p< 0.001.

No patient has reached the 5 year follow- up visit yet. - Impact of seropositivity on the comparative effectiveness between ABA, RTX and TCZ At 2 years, drug retention without failure among seropositive patients was significantly greater with RTX and TCZ than ABA (hazard ratio 1.99 [95% CI: 1.56;2.52], and 1.72 [95% CI: 1.22;2.42], respectively), with no difference between RTX and TCZ. At 2 years, drug retention without failure among seronegative patients was not significantly different between RTX and ABA (HR 1.39 [0.89; 2.17]). Drug retention without failure among seronegative patients was higher with TCZ than ABA (hazard ratio 1.93 [95% CI: 1.22;3.05], with no difference between RTX and TCZ.

Treatment and methods: Twenty-six patients with active RA were randomly allocated to receive either a single iv. infusion of placebo or 600 mg clodronate. Efficacy and safety were assessed weekly during the following three weeks by clinical and laboratory evaluations. Results: Serum osteocalcin and carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (markers of bone metabolism) were significantly decreased in the clodronate group at the end of the study, whereas the indices of disease activity including number of swollen joints, number of tender joints, patient's and doctor's estimation of condition (visual analogue scale), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C-reactive protein level were not affected by clodronate treatment. No serious adverse effects were observed. Conclusions: A single infusion of clodronate in patients with RA was safe and caused a decline in the markers of bone metabolism, but this short-term treatment did not suppress disease activity. Results from recent clinical and preclinical studies, however, suggest that the anti-inflammatory efficacy of clodronate requires liposome encapsulation."

We investigated whether dietary supplementation with borage(starflower) oil could be substituted for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), without exacerbation/worsening of clinical measures of disease activity in patients with RA. Methods: 28 patients were enrolled in the study. 14 patients received GLA-containing oil and 14 placebo. Patients were reviewed at 4, 12, 24 and 36 weeks and asked to gradually reduce their NSAID dose only if this did not exacerbate RA symptoms. Disease activity was assessed clinically using the Ritchie articular index (RAI), grip strength, duration of morning stiffness, 10cm visual analogue pain scale and subjective response. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C - reactive protein (CRP) were measured also. Results: Patient-centered outcomes were improved on active treatment, with a significant reduction in pain (p=0.0013, student's 2-tailed t-test), improvement in well being (Pearson Chi Square 6.8, p=0.032; likelihood-ratio Chi Square 7.2, p=0.027). There was a trend towards reduced NSAID requirement in the borage oil group (p=0.066, student's 2-tailed t-test).

The present study was carried out to investigate the antioxidant intake, the plasma levels of antioxidants and a marker of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) during the study presented earlier. METHODS: RA patients randomized to either a Mediterranean type diet (MD group; n = 26) or a control diet (CD group; n = 25) were compared during a three month dietary intervention study. Their antioxidant intake was assessed by means of diet history interviews and their intake of antioxidant-rich foods by a self-administered questionnaire. The plasma levels of retinol, antioxidants (alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, beta-carotene, lycopene, vitamin C and uric acid) and urinary malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker for oxidative stress, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography. The Student's t-test for independent samples and paired samples were used to test differences between and within groups. For variables with skewed distributions Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon signed ranks test were performed. To evaluate associations between dietary intake of antioxidants, as well as between disease activity, MDA and antioxidants we used Pearson's product moment correlation or Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS: The MD group had significantly higher intake frequencies of antioxidant-rich foods, and also higher intakes of vitamin C (p = 0.014), vitamin E (p = 0.007) and selenium (p = 0.004), and a lower intake of retinol (p = 0.049), compared to the CD group. However, the difference between the groups regarding vitamin C intake was not significant when under- and over-reporters were excluded (p = 0.066). There were no changes in urine MDA or in the plasma levels of antioxidants (after p-lipid adjustments of the tocopherol results), from baseline to the end of the study. The levels of retinol, vitamin C and uric acid were negatively correlated to disease activity variables. No correlation was found between antioxidant intake and the plasma levels of antioxidants. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an increase in reported consumption of antioxidant-rich foods during the Mediterranean diet intervention, the levels of plasma antioxidants and urine MDA did not change. However, the plasma levels of vitamin C, retinol and uric acid were inversely correlated to variables related to RA disease activity."

In a post-hoc analysis of the tofacitinib RA long-term extension (LTE) studies, we evaluated the effect of discontinuation of MTX or glucocorticoids (GC) on the maintenance of clinical efficacy of tofacitinib. Methods: data were analyzed from 2 open-label studies (NCT00413699  and NCT00661661) of patients (pts) with RA who completed randomized Phase 1/2/3 tofacitinib studies and 3 years of the LTE studies (LTE baseline to Year 3). Pts in this analysis received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily (BID) and utilized MTX or GC at LTE baseline. Discontinuation of MTX or GC was defined as no MTX/GC use within the last 30 days prior to the Year 3 visit. Clinical efficacy was evaluated at Year 3 utilizing the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI); further assessment stratified patients by clinical response 3 months after entrance into the LTE studies and was performed for maintenance of response out to Year 3. Results: overall, 186/1,608 pts that received MTX at LTE baseline (11.6%; tofacitinib 5 mg BID: n=49; tofacitinib 10 mg BID: n=137) discontinued MTX and 319/1,434 pts that received GC at LTE baseline (22.2%; tofacitinib 5 mg BID: n=114; tofacitinib 10 mg BID: n=205) discontinued GC out to Year 3. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics for pts receiving tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID were generally similar irrespective of whether pts discontinued/continued MTX or GC. Most pts who discontinued MTX or discontinued GC achieved CDAI remission (<2.8) or low disease activity (>2.8- <10) vs CDAI incomplete response (>10) at Year 3(Table 1). Mean (standard deviation) time off MTX and GC prior to Year 3, respectively, was 532 (347) and 523 (324) days for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 593 (338) and 592 (337) days for tofacitinib 10 mg BID. Most pts maintained their 3-month response at Year 3 after the discontinuation of MTX or GC, and response rates were comparable with pts who did not discontinue MTX or GC after Month 3(Table 2). Furthermore, of those not receiving MTX (1,044 pts) or GC (1,218 pts) at LTE baseline, 65 pts (6.2%; tofacitinib 5 mg BID: n=22; tofacitinib 10 mg BID: n=43) initiated MTX, and 306 pts (25.1%; tofacitinib 5 mg BID: n=82; tofacitinib 10 mg BID: n=224) initiated GC prior to Year 3. Conclusion: pts who achieve a high level response with tofacitinib may be able to discontinue MTX or GC and maintain their response. Additional analysis is warranted to understand the reasoning behind why pts initiated MTX or GC in the LTE studies.(Table Presented)"
9257654,,10.3899/jrheum.170770,"Background/Purpose: the prevalence of heart failure is increased 2-fold in RA; this is not explained by ischemic heart disease or other risk factors for heart failure. We have previously shown that N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I are elevated in RA, suggesting subtle myocardial dysfunction or chronic myocyte injury. We hypothesized that in patients with RA without known heart disease, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) would detect altered cardiac structure, function, and fibrosis. Methods: we performed 1.5-T CMR in 59 patients with RA and 56 controls frequency-matched for age, race, and sex. CMR indices of structure, function, and fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T1 values, extracellular volume fraction (ECV)) were compared between RA and control subjects using Mann-Whitney U tests and linear regression adjusting for age, race, and sex. Measurements were performed by CMR expert cardiologists blinded to disease or control status. Results: patients with RA had low to moderate disease activity (DAS28-CRP median  =3.16 [2.03, 4.05]. Indexed left ventricular (LV) mass, indexed LV end diastolic and systolic volumes, and left atrial size were not altered in RA. LV ejection fraction was also not significantly altered in RA. LGE was found in 2 patients with RA and 1 control subject; T1 mapping and ECV (measures of diffuse fibrosis) did not differ significantly between RA and control subjects (Table). Conclusion: contrary to a prior report, CMR measures of cardiac structure, function, and fibrosis were not significantly different in patients with well-controlled RA compared to a matched control group in the largest study to date.

The primary aim of this study is to analyze how personalized management guided by biological drug monitoring (BDM) in moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients impacts the annual direct costs of these patients to the Health System and the qualityadjusted life year with respect to conventional practice in Spain. Secondly, to evaluate the effectiveness of BDM in the reduction of the number of days with high disease activity compared with conventional practice. Follow up will be completed in December 2016; here we present partial descriptive data at 34 weeks. Methods: adult patients with RA, PsA or AS treated with ADL who have remained clinically stable for at least 6 months were recruited in three sites. Patients were grouped in Control and Intervention groups according to the recruiting site. All patients were treated with 40 mg of subcutaneous ADL and treatment frequency was adjusted based on physician criteria. All patients are assessed at 8 timepoints (8 visits) for up to 18 months. Trough ADL and anti-drug antibodies levels are measured with Promonitor-ADL and Promonitor-ANTI-ADL (Progenika, Spain). BDM data are released only to the Intervention group, and blinded to the Control group (managed according to clinical assessment only). Physicians in the Intervention group are not obliged to follow any therapeutic algorithm based on BDM results but can use tests to alter doses based on their judgement. Endpoints include DAS28, BASDAI, BASFI and HAQ-DI scores at every timepoint. Criteria for assessing disease scores are identical in the three sites. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated according to associated costs and QALY. Results: a total of 169 patients have been recruited (Disease, N Intervention, N Control groups, %) (RA, 30, 33, 37.3%; PsA, 33, 21, 32%; and AS, 46, 6, 30.8%). Median disease duration was 117, 98.5 and 101.5 months for RA, PsA and AS, respectively. At baseline, 10 (16.7%) and 29 (26.6%) patients had low disease activity and 50 (83.3%) and 80 (73.4%) patients were in remission in the Control and Intervention groups respectively, with median trough ADL levels 5.5 and 5.3 mg/L in the Control and Intervention groups respectively. At week 34 median trough ADL levels were 5.2 and 5.5 mg/L in the Control and Intervention groups respectively. Out of the total number of patients who were in remission at baseline (n=117), 69.6% (32/46) and 76.1% (54/71) remained in remission at week 34 in the Control and Intervention groups, respectively. Out of the patients who had low disease activity at baseline (n=35), 28.6% (2/7) and 35.7% (10/28) were in remission at week 34 in the Control and Intervention groups, respectively. Conclusion: partial descriptive data point towards a positive effect of BDM-complemented management compared to conventional practice only. This study will provide evidence on the clinical utility of personalized management of patients based on clinical assessment and biological drug monitoring (drug and anti-drug antibody levels) for adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis compared to management based on clinical assessments alone"
9257657,,10.4066/biomedicalresearch.62-18-412,"Background: Systemic inflammation has been associated with obesity, with elevated levels of triglycerides and reduced levels of HDL-cholesterol. Aim: To determine the frequency of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients suffering of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and to compare the evolution of MetS parameters during DMARD (Disease-Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs) therapy versus combination of DMARDs and biologics. Methods: The study was conducted on 277 RA patients, 115 AS patients and 103 PsA patients. Patients with inflammatory rheumatisms and MetS were randomized into two groups per disease (RA, AS and PsA). Group 1 underwent DMARD therapy. Group 2 followed a combination of DMARDs and biologics. Patients were assessed for the inflammatory status (C-reactive protein) and MetS (triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and blood pressure) initially, after 1 y and after 2 y. Results: 88 RA patients (31.7%), 16 AS patients (14%) and 35 PsA patients (34%) met the criteria for MetS. RA, AS and PsA patients with MetS who followed a combination of DMARDs and biologic therapy had significant improvement of triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol compared to patients who followed only DMARDs both at 1-y and 2-y assessments. There were no differences of the blood pressure in the two groups. Conclusion: The frequency of MetS was higher in RA and AS patients than in PsA patients. Biologic therapy could influence the evolution of MetS in patients suffering of autoimmune inflammatory rheumatisms.

Methods: participants were patients with RA initiating 1st- and 2nd-line biologic treatment from 2004 to 2015 in the National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases, a US-wide observational study that assesses outcomes and medications semiannually. Over a 2-year period, we evaluated changes in 8 HR-QOL measures (Global assessment , Health Assessment Questionnaire-II [HAQ2], Pain VAS [Pain], Patient Activity Scale-II [PAS2], Short Form 36 Physical [PCS] and Mental [MCS] Component Summary, EuroQOL US [EuroQOL], and Fatigue VAS [Fatigue]). 1st-line therapy was defined as initiation of a TNFi for which the patient was naive to any biologic or TOF; 2nd-line therapy was the initiation of the next biologic or TOF after first-line therapy. We calculated change scores for assessments completed after drug initiation by subtracting the baseline (observation before drug initiation) score. Our predictors of change in outcomes were study drug and time since drug initiation. We used mixed models to include fixed effects for drug and random effects for the intercept and slope of time for each individual. The interaction between drug and time was also included. To account for the non-randomization of drug groups, several covariables were added including: baseline age, sex, race, marital status, body mass index (BMI), Rheumatic Disease Comorbidity Index (RDCI), RA duration, and concomitant use of methotrexate and/or prednisone. Results: the 913 patients analyzed for 1st-line therapy were 79% female with a baseline mean+/-SD age of 59 +/-12 years, RA duration of 16+/-13 years, and RDCI of 1.7+/-1.5. There were no statistically significant differences in HR-QOL change scores among TNFis for 1st-line therapy. The 2nd-line cohort (N=2612) was 84% female with mean+/-SD age and RA duration of 60+/-12 and 18+/-12 years, and RDCI of 1.9+/-1.6. Analyses showed statistically significant superior improvement of Pain (0 - 10) for RIT vs. TNFi (differences of 1.0 at month 1 and ending at 0.6 at month 8) and vs. TOC (differences of 1.6 at month 1 and ending at 1.2 at month 5). RIT also showed significant improvement vs. TNFi at months 1 - 7 for PAS2 (0 - 10), with differences starting at 0.6 at month 1 and ending at 0.4 at month 7 (See Figure). Conclusion: results suggest that for 2nd-line therapy, RIT may be superior to TNFi and TOC during the first 5 to 8 months for pain, and during the first ~7 months when compared to TNFi for improving patient activity. For both lines of treatment, most medications were associated with modest improvement for the majority of outcomes in at least part of the study period. (Figure Presented)"

Prior work by our group ensured a robust validation process of translation and back-translation from French to American English (1). The objective of this study was to assess the performance of the American- English version of the FLARE questionnaire and to assure its validity in an American Native English-speaking RA cohort. Methods: fifty consecutive RA patients were recruited from the UCLA multi-physician rheumatology clinics who met the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) RA criteria. Patients completed a questionnaire with the following information: demographics, Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), patient global visual analogue scale (VAS), selfreported flare (Y/N), and American-English FLARE. The FLARE questionnaire was subcategorized into: physical component and emotional component. Other items obtained included: MD global VAS, MD reported flare, seropositivity, disease duration, swollen joint count (SJC), and tender joint count (TJC). The clinical disease activity index was calculated (CDAI). Analyses included Wilcoxon rank sum test and Spearman correlations. Results: subjects were separated in to two groups based on their report of RA flare (Y/N). RAPID3, CDAI, and FLARE totals were all significantly different between the groups (Table, p<0.05). In addition, there was a strong correlation between FLARE total and RAPID3 (corr=0.66, p<0.05) and a correlation between FLARE total and CDAI (corr=0.52, p<0.05). In addition, the correlation between CDAI and RAPID3 was 0.76 (p<0.5). Conclusion: the French/Danish and the American-English translation of the FLARE questionnaire correlate similarly with CDAI and RAPID3 (2, 3), and validates the suitable translation of the FLARE to American-English. There may be merit in using this instrument to assess flare in RA patients. However, further validation of the American-English FLARE questionnaire will be required to evaluate it prospectively in a randomized controlled trial. (Table Presented)"

Low-dose doxycycline (LDD) inhibits MMPs. We evaluated the efficacy of LDD for the subjective symptoms in primary SS patients. This was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled cross-over study. 22 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg LDD or matching placebo twice a day for 10 weeks. The first medication period was followed by 10-week washout period, after which the patient received either LDD or placebo, depending on the first drug received, followed by the second washout period. Stimulated saliva flow rates and pH were measured before and after one and ten weeks of each medication and after washout periods. VAS scale was used to assess the effect of LDD and placebo on following six subjective symptoms: xerostomia; xerophtalmia; difficulty of swallowing; myalgia; arthralgia; and fatigue. The effect was evaluated for each medication and washout period separately.
RESULTS: Overall, the effects of medications on subjective symptoms were minor. Wilcoxon test demonstrated increased fatigue with LDD during medication (p < 0.05). The differences may, however, reflect normal fluctuation of symptoms in SS patients.
CONCLUSION: LDD may not be useful in reducing the primary SS symptoms."
9257691,,10.3899/jrheum.161347,"Background/Purpose: ultrasound has been shown to detect subclinical synovitis in patients who are in clinical remission, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The value of power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) to predict flares in patients with RA in remission has not been fully studied. To determine whether PDUS assessment of synovitis predicts short term flares in patients with RA in clinical remission. Methods: consecutive RA patients in clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) were included. US examinations were performed at baseline by the same rheumatologist, blinded to clinical data, using an Esaote MyLab 70 machine (6-18 MHz broad band multifrequency linear transducer). A total of 20 joints of both hands were assessed: wrists, first to fifth MCPs and second to fifth PIPs. PDUS signal was evaluated on a semi-quantitative scale from 0 to 3. PD synovitis was defined as the presence of intraarticular USPD signal > 1, and was treated as a dichotomous variable. On the same day a complete clinical assessment was performed by another rheumatologist. Patients were followed-up and regularly assessed every two/three months. Flare was defined as the requirement of a change in disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (increasing dose, adding or changing DMARDs or biologics therapy) by the treating rheumatologist (blinded to baseline PDUS findings); or an increase in DAS28 >1.2 or a DAS28 >3.2 on follow-up. Baseline variables and the presence of PDUS, were compared among patients with and without flares in univariate analysis. Multivariable analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model, with flare as the outcome variable, and PD signal, demographic characteristics, and baseline disease activity as independent variables were also calculated. Results: 80 patients fulfilling DAS28 remission criteria were included. Baseline patients' characteristics are shown in the table. Among the 80 patients, 20 (25%) showed at least one joint with positive PDUS signal. Mean number of joints with PD signal was 1.75 (SD: 1.16, range 1-5). In 35 patients a treatment reduction was initiated by the treating rheumatologist, after inclusion in the study (blinded to baseline PDUS findings). Among the 80 patients on remission, 36 (45%) experienced a flare within follow up (median follow up (IQR): 15.4 (9.4-27.3) months). Flare occurred a median of 9.4 (IQR: 4.9-15.7) months after inclusion in the study (US date). In univariate analysis neither a positive PDUS signal, nor the reduction of treatment, nor the use of DMARDs in contrast with biologics, were associated with flares (table). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, none of the variables were associated with an increased risk of flare. Conclusion: among RA patients in clinical remission synovial inflammation by PDUS was seen in 25%, but it was not associated with disease flare in the short term. None of the variables studied were associated with increased risk of flare. (Table presented)"

Patients and methods: The study included 40 patients (2 males, 38 females; range 39 to 60 years) with RA. Patients were divided into two groups as intervention group (n=20) and control group (n=20) by random sampling method. Each group was given 10 sessions of physical therapy program. In addition, the intervention group received client-centered occupational therapy. Patients were evaluated with Turkish versions of Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Health Assessment Questionnaire, The Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2, RA Quality of Life Questionnaire, and Canadian Occupational Performance Measurement. Results: Pain, activity limitation, and participation restriction scores decreased significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group. Also, quality of life increased significantly in the intervention group (p<0.05). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that occupational therapy intervention reduces activity limitation and participation restrictions in patients with RA. Therefore, such interventions may be generalized for this patient group."

This abstract reports the results of the first-in-humans study of HMPL-523, a highly selective, potent, and orally available inhibitor of SYK. Methods: we conducted a 3-part study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HMPL-523 as well as its pharmacodynamics (PD) measured by CD63+ as the biomarker, and the effect of food on PK in healthy adult male subjects. The study design is summarized in the table below. Results: a total of 118 adult male healthy subjects were enrolled at baseline. 114 (96.6%) Subjects completed the study. A total of 83 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported as the following: 38.9% in the HMPL-523 groups, and 32.1% in the placebo groups, respectively. The majority of TEAEs were mild (63/83 or 75.9%) with 18/83 (21.7%) moderate events. Two serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported due to elevated lipase (HMPL-523 200mg) and febrile illness (HMPL-523 400mg) in Part B (multiple ascending doses ). As a result, HMPL-523 was discontinued in the two subjects. All of the TEAEs and SAEs were resolved. Part A (single ascending dose [SAD]) PK results revealed that HMPL-523 was rapidly absorbed with median time to maximum plasma concentration (TTmax) between 3 and 6 hours under both fasted and fed conditions. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of HMPL-523 increased proportionally with dose increase up to 800 mg. The terminal half-life (t1/2) ranged between 9.808 hours and 13.488 hours across HMPL-523 doses of 100 to 800 mg. Part B (MAD) PK results showed that steady state was achieved within 48 hours of daily administration and accumulation of 1.3 to 1.5 folds was observed over 14 days of dosing. In an ex vivo human whole blood PD assay, HMPL-523 inhibited anti-IgE-induced basophil (CD63+) in a concentration-dependent manner with an estimated half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 47.70 ng/mL. The human PK exposures at 200 mg once daily and above can be expected to provide the target coverage required for clinical efficacy based on the preclinical PK/PD analysis. In Part C, systemic exposure of HMPL-523 was increased up to 1.5 folds when administered in the fed condition compared to the fasted condition, indicating that food consumption increases the relative bioavailability of HMPL-523. Conclusion: overall, the safety and laboratory data suggests that the single and multiple doses of HPML-523 were generally well tolerated. A multiple-dose regimen of 300 mg or less of HMPL-523, administered once daily, is recommended for future Phase II clinical trials for autoimmune diseases"

Methods: a total of 189 RA patients in PK analysis part from a randomized controlled phase 3 study (NCT02149121) was randomly assigned in 1: 1: 1 ratio to receive 2 infusions of 1,000 mg CT-P10, US-sourced innovator rituximab (US-RTX) or EU-RTX with a 2-week interval. The following PK parameters were coprimary endpoints: area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-last), AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf) and maximum concentration after the second infusion (Cmax) of CT-P10, US-RTX or EU-RTX. Pharmacokinetic similarity is concluded if the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of geometric means in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and Cmax are entirely contained within the bounds of 80% and 125% for the following comparisons: cT-P10 vs US-RTX, CT-P10 vs EU-RTX, and US-RTX vs EU-RTX. Results: the PK parameters among 3 treatment groups were highly similar(Table 1). The 90% CIs for the ratio of geometric means for coprimary endpoints fell within the PK equivalence margin of 80-125% indicating that drug exposures from CT-P10 are similar to those from both US-RTX and EU-RTX and also from US-RTX to those of EU-RTX(Table 2). The safety profiles among 3 treatment groups were generally similar. Adverse events (AEs) due to infusion related reaction were reported for 6 (9.4%), 4 (6.2%) and 12 (20.0%) patients in CT-P10, US-RTX and EU-RTX, respectively. All these events were mild to moderate (grade 1 or 2) in intensity. Six patients were discontinued due to an AE (2 , 3 [4.6%] and 1 [1.7%] patients in CT-P10, US-RTX and EU-RTX, respectively). No malignancy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, serious infection or death occurred in any of the treatment groups. Conclusion: pharmacokinetic equivalence was demonstrated in terms of AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax in the comparisons of CT-P10 to US-RTX, CT-P10 to EU-RTX, and US-RTX to EU-RTX in RA patients. In addition, comparable safety profiles were observed among the 3 treatment groups. (Table Presented)"
9257738,,10.1007/s12325-016-0295-8,"Abstract: methotrexate (MTX) is still considered the drug of choice in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management. Comparing subcutaneous (MTX SC) and oral (MTX OR) routes of administration is important to optimize the everyday therapeutic strategy in the real-life setting. This review summarizes scientific evidence currently available on this topic. AS shown by pharmacokinetic studies, at the same dose level, bioavailability of MTX SC is significantly higher and less variable than that of MTX OR. This difference is even more pronounced for medium-to-high dosages (i.e., >15 mg/week). With regard to clinical response (disease activity score-28, american college of rheumatology criteria), randomized, double-blind studies and retrospective or longitudinal analyses in real-life settings showed that MTX SC is more effective than MTX OR. This is true both in mtx-naive patients with early RA, and in patients WHO switch from MTX OR to MTX SC due to previous treatment failure, lack of efficacy and/or adverse events. Finally, MTX SC has a better tolerability profile than MTX OR, with fewer gastroenterological side effects. Delaying the use of more expensive biological therapies by switching from MTX OR to MTX SC in non-responders might provide cost savings, with relevant implications in the management of patients with RA.

We analyzed prevalence and clinical symptoms of mixed cryoglobulinemia in our region among patients with chronic hepatitis C (n = 29) and B (n = 7) in comparison to alcoholic liver cirrhosis without evidence of hepatitis virus infection (n = 10). Cryoglobulinemia was found in 13/29 patients with hepatitis C (11 type III, one type I1-III and one type II), 2/7 with hepatitis B (one type II, one type III) and 4/10 with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (one type II, three type III). Patients with moderate active hepatitis had more type II than type III cryoglobulins. Concerning clinical symptoms, only sicca syndrome was more frequent in patients with hepatitis C. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and immune globulin M (IgM) levels were higher in hepatitis C than in the other groups. Renal disease was rare in all but not different between the groups. Mixed cryoglobulinemia in hepatitis C (and B) is most frequently of type III. Patients with hepatitis C had the same prevalence of cryoglobulins as patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Cryoglobulins had no influence on clinical syndromes or organ damage."

Rosuvastatin is an antidyslipidemic agent with anti-inflammatory activity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of rosuvastation as adjuvant therapy to methotrexate on hematological parameters in Iraqi patients with moderately-highly active RA.Methods: A single center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 8 weeks duration was performed. Disease activity was measured via calculating the disease activity score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR). 40 Patients who were using methotrexate (MTX) intramuscularly were randomly allocated to receive each day either rosuvastatin 10 mg tablet or capsules prefilled with glucose as placebo and were evaluated at baseline and at week 8 for hematological parameters.Results: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and platelet count were significantly more reduced in rosuvastatin group than placebo group after 8weeks. Non significant changes were observed in the hemoglobin (Hb) amount and white blood cells (WBC) count between groups. No significant correlation was recorded between ESR and Hb in both groups.Conclusion: Low dose rosuvastatin adjuvant to MTX seem to be an effective method to lower ESR and platelet count in rheumatoid arthritis patients.  2013 GESDAV."

A secondary purpose was to analyse factors predicting long-term disability, back pain and health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes after lumbar fusion. Relevance: The study provides evidence for the effectiveness of early physiotherapy after lumbar fusion. Further more improved knowledge of predictive factors can help physiotherapist in the screening of lumbar fusion candidates and the individualised implementation of pre-surgical and postsurgical interventions. Participants: A total of 107 patients were recruited from the Karolinska University Hospital's Orthopaedic Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden. The inclusion criteria were: men and women aged between 18 and 65 years with a >12 months history of back pain and/or sciatica; a primary diagnosis of spinal stenosis, degenerative or isthmic spondylolisthesis or degenerative disc disease; selected for lumbar fusion with or without decompression; competence in the Swedish language. The criteria for exclusion were: previous lumbar fusion, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Methods: An open book randomised controlled trial with pre-surgical and post-surgical measures at 3, 6, 12 and 24-36 months was performed to investigate the effectiveness of a psychomotor therapy focusing on cognition, behaviour and motor relearning compared to exercise therapy focusing on strength and conditioning, applied during the first 3 months after lumbar fusion. Randomisation allocated 53 patients to psychomotor therapy and 54 patients to exercise therapy. The Oswestry disability index (ODI) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures included the Visual analogue scale for back pain (VAS), European quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D), as well as other clinical, psychological and work related variables. Analysis: A total of 78 patients were needed assuming a power = 80%. Patient compliance was analysed and an intention to treat principle applied to data analysis. For statistical comparison between the 2 independent groups, analysis of covariance was used. Categorical regression with optimal scaling transformation, elastic net regularization and bootstrapping were used to investigate pre-surgical predictor variables and address predictive model validity. Results: Follow-up rates were 93% at 12 months and 81% at 24-36 months after surgery. Psychomotor therapy improved functional disability, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy and fear of movement/(re)injury significantly more than exercise therapy at respective follow-up occasions. Pre-surgical control over pain significantly predicted functional disability and HRQOL. Pre-surgical catastrophizing and leg pain intensity significantly predicted functional disability and back pain while the pre-surgical lasegue test significantly predicted back pain. The implementation of post-operative psychomotor therapy also significantly predicted functional disability while pre-surgical outcome expectations significantly predicted HRQOL. Conclusions: The study shows that post-operative rehabilitation can be safely implemented during the first 3 months after lumbar fusion and should include measures to modify psychological as well as motor functions. The study also demonstrates the importance of pre-surgical psychological factors, leg pain intensity, the lasegue test and post-operative psychomotor therapy in the predictions of functional disability, back pain and HRQOL related outcomes. Implications: Physiotherapist should screen patients pain, psychological factors and neuromusculoskeletal system pre surgically and rehabilitate patients with early psychomotor therapy after lumbar fusion."

Patients with JIA seen between May 2008 and May 2012 and considered nonresponsive to methotrexate (MTX) were given LEF and prospectively followed. Primary outcome was a 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) of low disease activity (< 3.2) in less than 6 months. Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) scores and safety data were recorded. Results. Forty-three patients (33 female) were included with 25 (58.1%) polyarticular, 10 oligoarticular (7 extended; 3 persistent), 6 systemic, and 2 enthesitis-related. Ten (23.2%) were rheumatoid factor-positive and 7 (16.3%) had antinuclear antibodies. Prior drugs other than MTX: 11 (25.5%) chloroquine diphosphate + MTX and 2 (4.6%) sulfasalazine + MTX; mean prednisone dose was 6.4 + 9.3 mg. The MTX dose prior to LEF was 14.5 + 4.5 mg/m2/week. LEF dose and duration of therapy were 16.6 + 5.2 mg/d and 3.6 + 2.2 years, respectively. Nineteen patients (44.2%) interrupted LEF: 1 entered remission, 11 were nonresponsive, and 7 were intolerant (16.2%). Baseline DAS28 (5.57 + 0.7) dropped to 3.7 + 1.2 at final analysis (p < 0.001) and 16 patients (37.2%) had a low DAS28 [< 3.2; 12 (27.9%) while taking LEF + MTX and 4 (9.3%) while taking monotherapy].

STUDY DESIGN: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (n = 339) enrolled in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial completed the MHAQ and the SF-36 pre- and post-treatment. Psychometric analyses used confirmatory factor analysis and IRT models. Analyses of variance were used to assess sensitivity to changes in disease severity (defined by the American College of Rheumatism (ACR)) using change scores in MHAQ, PF10, and IRT scales. Analyses of covariance were used to assess treatment responsiveness.
RESULTS: For the entire score range, the 95% confidence interval around individual patient scores was smaller for the combined (total) IRT based scale than for other measures. The MHAQ and PF10 were about 70% and 50% as efficient as the total IRT score of physical functioning in discriminating among ACR groups, respectively. The MHAQ and PF10 were also less efficient than the total IRT score in discriminating among treatment groups.

to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements, but consensus is lacking
regarding the optimal route and dose of administration. The aim of this study was
to compare the efficacy and safety of topical and intravenous routes of TXA with
routine hemostasis in patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a randomized, multicenter, parallel,
open-label clinical trial in adult patients undergoing primary TKA. Patients were
divided into three groups of 50 patients each: Group 1 received 1 g topical TXA,
Group 2 received 2 g intravenous TXA, and Group 3 (control group) had routine
hemostasis. The primary outcome was total blood loss. Secondary outcomes were
hidden blood loss, blood collected in drains, transfusion rate, number of blood
units transfused, adverse events, and mortality. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty
patients were included. Total blood loss was 1021.57 (481.09) mL in Group 1,
817.54 (324.82) mL in Group 2 and 1415.72 (595.11) mL in Group 3 (control group).
Differences in total blood loss between the TXA groups and the control group were
clinically and statistically significant (p < 0.001). In an exploratory analysis
differences between the two TXA groups were not statistically significant (p =
0.073) Seventeen patients were transfused. Transfusion requirements were
significantly higher in Group 3 (p = 0.005). No significant differences were
found between groups regarding adverse events. CONCLUSION: We found that 1 g of
topical TXA and 2 g of intravenous TXA were both safe strategies and more
effective than routine hemostasis to reduce blood loss and transfusion
requirements after primary TKA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I."

An analysis of a clinical trial to assess the effects of treatment reduction and withdrawal on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in patients with early, moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) WHO achieved 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) low disease activity (LDA) or remission with etanercept (ETN) plus methotrexate (MTX) therapy. Methods. During treatment induction, patients received open-label ETN 50 mg weekly plus MTX for 52 weeks. In the reduced-treatment phase, patients with das28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) . 3.2 at week 39 and DAS28-ESR < 2.6 at week 52 in the open-label phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with ETN 25 mg plus MTX, MTX, or placebo (PBO) for 39 weeks (weeks 0.39). In the third phase, patients WHO achieved DAS28 remission (DAS28-ESR < 2.6) or LDA (2.6 . DAS28-ESR . 3.2) at week 39 in the double-blind phase had all treatment withdrawn and were observed for an additional 26 weeks (weeks 39.65). Results. Of the 306 patients enrolled, 193 were randomized in the double-blind phase and 131 participated in the treatment-withdrawal phase. After reduction or withdrawal of ETN 50 mg/mtx, patients reduced to ETN 25 mg/mtx experienced slight, nonsignificant declines in the majority of PRO measures, whereas switching to PBO or MTX alone caused significant declines. Presenteeism and activity impairment scores were significantly better in the ETN reduced-dose group versus MTX monotherapy and PBO at week 39 (p . 0.05). Conclusion. In patients with early RA WHO achieved remission while receiving full-dose ETN/MTX, continuing combination therapy at a lower dose did not cause a significant worsening of PRO response, but switching to MTX alone or PBO did.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of subclinical pulmonary abnormalities in anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positive subjects without evidence of arthritis and in patients with RA using HRCT. Material and Methods: we enrolled 22 consecutive pa-tients,6 men and 16 women (mean age 48. 93+/-12. 1 SD) all ACPA-positive. 6 subjects without clinical evidence of arthritis; 10 patients with early RA (E-RA) naive to therapy (duration <24 weeks); 6 patients with clinically manifest RA (CM-RA) in therapy (duration <36 months). All patients underwent to a HRCT of the chest (Somatom definition Siemens) with helical supine inspiratory acquisition contiguous (5mm); images were reconstructed at 1 mm every 20 mm with high-resolution algorithms. HRCT images were reviewed by 2 ra-diologists who were blinded to each subject with regard to disease status. Lung abnormalities were classified as the presence or absence of airways disease (1 or more of the following: bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, centrilobular opacities and abnormal air trapping) or parenchymal disease (1 or more of the following: ground-glass opacities/alveolar infiltrates, nodules, and interstitial lung disease/fibrosis). Results: pulmonary nodules were detected in 12/22 (55%) patients: 2/6 (33%) of positive ACPA subjects without arthritis, 7/10 (70%) of the E-RA patients, 5/6 (83%) of patients CM-RA. Others pulmonary abnormalities were observed: fi-brosis (45%), enfisema (18%); consolidation, bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening and abnormal air trapping in 13%; ground glass opacities (9%). These lung abnormalities had a significantly higher prevalence in patients CM-RA respect to t those without arthritis (p=0. 021). Conclusion: this preliminary study demonstrated that pulmonary nodules are developed early and frequently in the course of the RA. Because the early lung involvement in RA is often subclinical and hardly detectable by commonly used tests (PFR), the results of this study suggest the use of HRCT in positive ACPA subjects without arthritis and ERA patients"

METHODS: The following efficacy endpoints were evaluated using time-weighted change from baseline in a 12-week, randomized controlled clinical trial with etoricoxib: Patient Global Assessment of Pain, Swollen Joint Count, Tender Joint Count, Health Assessment Questionnaire. The following three treatment groups were evaluated: placebo, pooled etoricoxib 10/30/60 mg, and etoricoxib 90 mg. Screening values, values post flare, as well as changes after treatment were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 1014 patients screened, 761 were randomized; 50% were on no background bDMARDs and/or CS therapy, 23% used bDMARDs, 34% used CS, and 8% used both bDMARDs and CS. It was demonstrated that RA patients on bDMARDs or CS had similar pain levels at screening as patients without this co-medication. They experienced flare upon NSAID withdrawal and demonstrated dose-dependent pain improvement with etoricoxib.
CONCLUSION: These results support that RA patients receiving bDMARDs or CS may still require the use of concomitant analgesics to treat pain. Clinicians should continue to monitor and treat pain even after initiating a bDMARD and/or CS.

We carried out a two center, 2 year, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial with a third year of nontreatment follow-up. We studied 120 women requiring long-term glucocorticoid therapy at > 2.5 mg/day prednisolone randomized to treatment with daily placebo; daily 2.5 mg risedronate; or cyclical 15 mg risedronate (2 out of 12 weeks). At 97 weeks, bone mineral density was maintained at the lumbar spine (+1.4%) and trochanter (+0.4%) in the daily 2.5 mg risedronate group, while significant bone loss occurred in the placebo group (-1.6%, p = 0.03; and 4.0%, p < 0.005, respectively). At the femoral neck, there was a nonsignificant bone loss in the daily 2.5 mg risedronate group (-1.0%) while in the placebo group bone mass decreased significantly (-3.6%, p < 0.001). The difference between placebo and daily 2.5 mg risedronate groups was significant at the lumbar spine (p = 0.009) and trochanter (p = 0.02) but did not reach statistical significance at the femoral neck. Although not significantly different from placebo at the lumbar spine, the overall effect of the cyclical regimen was similar to that of the daily 2.5 mg risedronate regimen. Treatment withdrawal led to bone loss in the risedronate groups that was significant at the lumbar spine. A similar number of patients experienced adverse events (including upper gastrointestinal events) across treatment groups and risedronate was generally well tolerated. Thus risedronate preserves bone mass in postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis receiving glucocorticoids while patients receiving a placebo have significant bone loss."

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a combination of Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatoid Drugs (DMARDs) with Intra-articular Glucocorticoids versus only DMARDs in a group of patients with early Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Fifty patients diagnosed as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) by American Rheumatology Association (ARA) criteria (1987) with disease duration less than two years were randomized into two groups. The Control group received a combination of Methotrexate 15 mg daily with Sulfasalazine 2 gm daily for 3 months and the Study group received the above combination along with Intra-articular injections of Triamcinolone acetate (40 mg per ml) in each of the swollen joints at the start of the study. Outcome was assessed in terms of Disease Activity Score (DAS-28), American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 criteria and number of rescue medications used at the end of 3 months.
RESULTS: The study group had significant reductions in DAS 28 scores (3.39 versus 4.99 in control group) and significantly more subjects achieved the ACR 20/50/70 criteria at the end of 3 months (100/60/36% versus 84/20/0%) Secondary end-points like tender and swollen joint count, ESR, early morning stiffness, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) scores and general health status were significantly reduced in the study group. Also, significantly lesser rescue medications were needed in the study group.
CONCLUSION: Combination of DMARDs with Intra-articular corticosteroids is significantly better than DMARDs alone in early RA."

Fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly higher after betamethasone, whereas deflazacort increased only fasting plasma insulin. After oral glucose there were significant increases in blood glucose and insulin after betamethasone compared with deflazacort. These results suggest that the degree of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance depends on the steroid used and on the dose given, although long-term treatment with deflazacort has a smaller effect on glucose metabolism than betamethasone."

Design: randomised controlled trial in a routine clinical setting. Setting: acute orthopaedic wards and operating theatres, yan chai hospital, hong kong. Patients: sixty patients underwent elective unilateral total knee replacement under spinal anaesthesia from may 2009 to september 2011 and were randomly assigned to continuous femoral nerve blockade or conventional patient-controlled analgesia (30 patients in each group). Main outcome measures: quality of pain control was evaluated by pain scores at rest and during mobilisation, opioid consumption, frequency of sideeffects, and patient satisfaction score. Rehabilitation progress was assessed according to the day of first starting weight-bearing exercise, day of independent walking in the ward with aid, timed up and go test, and time elapsing till discharge. Surgical outcome was assessed by the knee society score 6 months after discharge, re-admissions, and occurrence of complications. Results: patients having continuous femoral nerve blockade tended to have less pain on movement and achieved earlier mobilisation than those having patient-controlled analgesia. The former group consumed less opioids, had fewer side-effects, and were more satisfied with their postoperative analgesia. Both groups showed an equally high degree of satisfaction with the new management pathway. Hospital stays, surgical outcomes, and frequency of complications were similar in the two groups. Conclusion: continuous femoral nerve blockade proved to BE a feasible and better alternative mode of postoperative analgesia than our conventional patientcontrolled analgesia. Our new multidisciplinary management pathway and multimodal analgesic regimen featuring the continuous femoral nerve blockade appeared beneficial to patients and effective in our clinical setting"

Objective: our objective was to compare the clinical profile of CT-P10 versus RTX in patients with RA who received up to two courses of treatment and were followed for up to 72 weeks. Methods: in this multicenter double-blind phase I study, patients were randomized 2: 1 to receive CT-P10 1000 mg or RTX 1000 mg at weeks 0 and 2. Based on disease activity, patients could receive a second course of treatment between weeks 24 and 48. Efficacy endpoints, including mean change from baseline in Disease Activity Score using 28 joints (DAS28), safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics were evaluated. Results: in total, 154 patients were randomized to CT-P10 or RTX (n = 103 and 51, respectively); 137 (n = 92 and 45) completed the first course of treatment, of whom 83 (n = 60 and 23) were re-treated. Improvements from baseline in all efficacy endpoints were highly similar between the CT-P10 and RTX groups over both treatment courses. At week 24 after the second course, mean change from week 0 of the first course in DAS28 erythrocyte sedimentation rate was -2.47 and -2.04 for CT-P10 and RTX, respectively, (p = 0.1866) and in DAS28 C-reactive protein was -2.32 and -2.00, respectively (p = 0.3268). The proportion of patients positive for antidrug antibodies at week 24 after the second treatment course was 20.0% and 21.7% in the CT-P10 and RTX groups, respectively. The safety profile of CT-P10 was comparable to that of RTX, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties were similar. Conclusions: in patients with RA, efficacy, safety, and other clinical data were comparable between CT-P10 and RTX after up to two courses of treatment over 72 weeks.

After 3 weeks of treatment the vitamin E group (n = 42) as well as the diclofenac group (n = 43) showed a significant improvement of all assessed clinical parameters. Duration of morning stiffness could be reduced under vitamin E treatment from 90 min to 68 min and under diclofenac treatment from 68 min to 30 min.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: to determine whether injection with triamcinolon acetonide reduces the size of rheumatoid nodules, we randomized twenty patients with symptomatic nodules to either triamcinolon acetonide 40 mg/ml plus lidocaine 2% or lidocaine 1% (placebo). We measured the nodules before injection and 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after injection. Possible side effects were recorded.
RESULTS: we found that the volume of the nodules injected with triamcinolon acetonide reduced significantly (p = 0.011), from 130 to 8 mm(3) (median calculated size) at 12 weeks, compared with baseline. Furthermore, at 12 weeks, the difference between the groups was significant (p = 0.03). The median size of the placebo nodules diminished as well, from 358 to 237 mm(3), but this was not significant. Pain at injection was the only side effect, equally distributed in both treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: injection with triamcinolon acetonide seems to be an alternative for surgery of rheumatoid nodules. No adverse events occurred but the limited sample does not allow definitive conclusions."
9257949,,10.3899/jrheum.160915,"Objective. To evaluate and compare the utility of commonly used outcome measures for assessing disease exacerbation or flare in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. Data from the Dutch Potential Optimalisation of (Expediency) and Effectiveness of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers (POET) study, in which 462 patients discontinued their tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor, were used. The ability of different measures to discriminate between those with and without physician-reported flare or medication escalation at the 3-month visit (T2) was evaluated by calculating effect size (ES) statistics. Responsiveness to increased disease activity was compared between measures by standardizing change scores (SCS) from baseline to the 3-month visit. Finally, the incremental validity of individual outcome measures beyond the Simplified Disease Activity Score was evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Results. The SCS were greater for disease activity indices than for any of the individual measures. The 28-joint Disease Activity Score, Clinical Disease Activity Index, and Simplified Disease Activity Index performed similarly. Pain and physician's (PGA) and patient's global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity were the most responsive individual measures. Similar results were obtained for discriminative ability, with greatest ES for disease activity indices followed by pain, PGA, and PtGA. Pain was the only measure to demonstrate incremental validity beyond SDAI in predicting 3-month flare status. Conclusion. These results support the use of composite disease activity indices, patient-reported pain and disease activity, and physician-reported disease activity for measuring disease exacerbation or identifying flares of RA. Physical function, acute-phase response, and the auxiliary measures fatigue, participation, and emotional well-being performed poorly. Copyright ¬© The Journal of Rheumatology 2017"

As a consequence the clinical burden of GOA is largely unknown. More insight into the clinical burden of GOA is needed in order to improve its management and to develop treatment tailored to the patients' needs and problems. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the clinical burden of GOA in terms of activity limitations and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two non-pharmacological treatment programmes for patients with GOA were used. GOA was defined as having musculoskeletal complaints in >2 joint groups and having>1 objective signs of OA in>1 joint. In addition, patients had to be limited in performing daily activities (HAQ-DI score > 0.5). Patients clinically diagnosed with GOA by a rheumatologist and referred to multidisciplinary treatment completed self-reported questionnaires to assess socio-demographics, joint involvement (self-report and objective), activity limitations (HAQ-DI) and HRQoL (SF-36 physical (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) norm based scores). Patients were asked to report the three most important activity limitations due to GOA and to rate its severity on a visual analogue scale. Reported activity limitations were linked to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) using established linking rules. Results: In total, 147 patients (85% female) participated in this study with a mean (SD) age of 60 (8) years. Hundred-fifteen patients (78%) reported musculoskeletal complaints in > 4 joint areas. Self-reported and objective signs of OA were most common in the hands (n = 125; 85%) and knees (n = 121; 82%). Patients with GOA were moderately to severely limited in performing daily activities reflected by a mean (SD) HAQ-DI score of 1.27 (0.50). ""Much difficulty"" with activities such as shopping or doing chores were reported by more than half of the patients. Patients with GOA experience a markedly reduced HRQoL on the physical domain reflected by a mean (SD) PCS score of 32 (8), which is comparable with the impact of Rheumatoid Arthritis on HRQoL. Activities concerning mobility and domestic life were most frequently reported as being important activity limitations, in particular walking (Table 1). (Table Presented) Conclusion: The results of this study suggest a high clinical burden at least in selected patients with GOA in terms of activity limitations and HRQoL. According to the results it is conceivable that non-pharmacological treatment targets for patients with GOA may focus especially on the physical domain of HRQoL and on mobility limitations (walking in particular) as these activities are the most important for patients."

Methods: 80 eligible subjects were enrolled from 7 sites. Subjects received infliximab 3 mg/kg IV infusion at 0, 2, 6 weeks, repeated every 8 weeks until 22 weeks. Endpoints included 7-joint and 12-joint ultrasound (US) synovitis scores at 22 weeks, and correlations between US scores and DAS28 (using CRP)/radiography (modified Sharp score (MSS)/van der Heijde scoring)/HAQ outcome. The 7 joints included those of the clinically dominant hand and foot: wrist, second and third metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal, and second and fifth metatarsophalangeal joints. Results: The patients (81.25% women) had a mean age of 47.22A + 14.27 years (meanA + SD). Baseline 7-joint and 12-joint synovitis scores were 22.35A + 11.67 and 42.09A + 29.64 in grayscale and power Doppler (GS+PD) US, 15.45A + 5.54 and 29.41A + 16.12 in GS US, and 6.90A + 7.26 and 12.68A + 15.65 in PD US. At baseline, DAS28 was 5.73A + 1.05, MSS was 17.75A + 25.27, SDAI was 187.29A + 55.68, CDAI was 152.16A + 45.82, and HAQ score was 1.36A + 0.79. 64 patients (80.00%) completed all visits and 66 patients (82.50%) completed treatment for 22 weeks. After 22 weeks of therapy, 7-joint GS+PD US scores significantly decreased to 18.97A + 10.81 and the GS US and PD US scores significantly decreased to 11.98A + 6.42 (P< 0.01) and 3.34A + 4.59 (P< 0.01), respectively (Figure). There were significant decreases in scores for 12-joint GS+PD US (28.47A + 20.93), GS US (22.65A + 15.19, P< 0.01), PD US (5.82A + 8.17, P< 0.01), DAS28 (3.20A + 1.31, P< 0.01), SDAI (77.73A + 54.27), and CDAI (62.13A + 41.95). MSS increased (18.04A + 23.91, P> 0.05) and HAQ score significantly decreased (0.56A + 0.61, P< 0.01). There was a positive correlation between US scores and RA activity evaluation indexes, including DAS28, SDAI and CDAI (correlation coefficients 0.5535, 0.6364 and 0.5532) (Table). 14 patients experienced an adverse event and 2 patients experienced a serious adverse event. (Figure Presented) Conclusion: In this study, treatment with TNF inhibitors relieved synovitis in patients with moderate to severe RA. US is a viable tool for examining patients with RA in daily practice because it significantly reflects therapeutic response. The 7-joint US synovitis score can be used for the evaluation of clinical efficacy in the clinic, instead of the 12-joint method. This trial showed that there is a positive correlation between US scores and DAS28. Large multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm this preliminary observation."

DESIGN: Experimental, prospective and longitudinal study.
SETTING: Samples were taken at the hospital and the diets were followed at home.
SUBJECTS: Volunteers were recruited from the hospital and were either hospital staff or post-graduate students. No volunteers failed to complete the study but one was omitted from analysis due to lack of compliance.
INTERVENTIONS: Eleven healthy premenopausal women aged 22-47 y and 11 healthy postmenopausal women ages 45-70 y followed a high (300 mmol/d) and a low (50 mmol/d) sodium diet for one week each. On the 7th day of each diet, blood and urine samples were taken.
RESULTS: On the high sodium diet 24 h urinary sodium and calcium values relative to creatinine were significantly higher for all subjects (P < 0.05). Postmenopausal women on the high sodium diet had biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption in relation to the low sodium diet. However in premenopausal women there was no such change. Calcium absorption did not change significantly in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: It appears that postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, women respond to a high sodium diet by an increase in bone resorption which may lead to reduced bone density.

Four groups were given either 5, 0.5 or 0.05¬†mg of bCII or a placebo in a double-blind randomised control trial. The sera IgG anti-collagen type II and antibodies of the IgG subclasses, IgG1-4, were measured at the start and end of the trial by ELISA. Total IgG anti-collagen II antibodies in the pooled active treatment groups were statistically significantly reduced compared with the placebo group (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.021).

Treatment with bCII in patients with RA led to a reduction in anti-collagen II antibody titre indicating an active biological effect as observed previously in animal model of RA. The largest decrease in total and subclasses of anti-collagen antibody titres occurred in the groups of patients with the best therapeutic response to bCII, supporting the conclusion of the clinical trial and suggests that immune regulation explains the therapeutic effect."

Group cognitive-behavioural (CB) therapy delivered by a clinical psychologist demonstrated large improvements in fatigue impact. However, few rheumatology teams include a clinical psychologist, therefore, this study aims to examine whether conventional rheumatology teams can reproduce similar results, potentially widening intervention availability.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: this is a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial of a group CB intervention for RA fatigue self-management, delivered by local rheumatology clinical teams. 7 centres will each recruit 4 consecutive cohorts of 10-16 patients with RA (fatigue severity ‚â• 6/10). After consenting, patients will have baseline assessments, then usual care (fatigue self-management booklet, discussed for 5-6 min), then be randomised into control (no action) or intervention arms. The intervention, Reducing Arthritis Fatigue by clinical Teams (RAFT) will be cofacilitated by two local rheumatology clinicians (eg, nurse/occupational therapist), who will have had brief training in CB approaches, a RAFT manual and materials, and delivered an observed practice course. Groups of 5-8 patients will attend 6 √ó 2 h sessions (weeks 1-6) and a 1 hr consolidation session (week 14) addressing different self-management topics and behaviours. The primary outcome is fatigue impact (26 weeks); secondary outcomes are fatigue severity, coping and multidimensional impact, quality of life, clinical and mood status (to week 104). Statistical and health economic analyses will follow a predetermined plan to establish whether the intervention is clinically and cost-effective. Effects of teaching CB skills to clinicians will be evaluated qualitatively.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: approval was given by an NHS Research Ethics Committee, and participants will provide written informed consent. The copyrighted RAFT package will be freely available. Findings will be submitted to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Clinical Commissioning Groups and all UK rheumatology departments.

9257990,,10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006560,"OBJECTIVE: to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) versus MTX monotherapy in early, aggressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when explicitly modelling short-term (reversible) and long-term (irreversible, ie, joint damage) disease activity and physical function. METHODS: a microsimulation model was developed to unify, in a single cost-effectiveness model, measures of reversible and irreversible disease activity and physical function based on data from the PREMIER trial. Short term, reversible disease activity was modelled using DAS28 variables, including swollen joint counts, tender joint counts, c reactive protein concentration and pain. The DAS28 variables were then used in a logistic regression to predict short-term american college of rheumatology (ACR) responses, which informed treatment continuation and switches. Long term, irreversible, radiographically documented joint damage was modelled using modified total sharp score (mtss). The model then linked both short-term disease activity and mtss to the health assessment questionnaire score, which was used to calculate direct and indirect costs, and quality adjusted life-years (qalys). RESULTS: when both reversible and irreversible effects of therapy were included, combination therapy was estimated to produce 6-month 50% ACR responses in 75% of patients versus 54% in MTX monotherapy. Compared to MTX monotherapy, combination therapy resulted in 2.68 and 3.04 discounted life years and qalys gained, respectively. Combination therapy also resulted in a net increase in direct costs of ¬£106,207 for a resulting incremental cost/qaly gain of ¬£32,425. When indirect costs were included in the analysis, the ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) decreased to ¬£27,238. Disregarding irreversible effects increased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to ¬£78,809 (when only direct costs were included). CONCLUSIONS: starting with adalimumab plus MTX combination therapy in early, aggressive RA is cost-effective when irreversible damage is adequately considered."

OBJECTIVES: The study aims were (1) to estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding an optimised exercise programme for hands and upper limbs to standard care for patients with RA; and (2) to qualitatively describe the experience of participants in the trial with a particular emphasis on acceptability of the intervention, exercise behaviours and reasons for adherence/non-adherence.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentred, individually randomised controlled trial with an embedded qualitative study. Outcome assessors were blind to group assignment and independent of treatment delivery.
SETTING: Seventeen NHS trusts in England comprising 21 rheumatology and therapy departments.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with RA who had pain and dysfunction of the hands and/or wrists and had been on stable medication for at least 3 months. Patients were excluded if they were under 18 years old, had undergone upper limb surgery/fracture in the last 6 months, were on a waiting list for upper limb surgery or were pregnant.
INTERVENTIONS: Usual care or usual care plus an individualised exercise programme. Usual care consisted of joint protection education, general exercise advice and functional splinting if required. The exercise programme consisted of six sessions of strengthening and stretching exercises with a hand therapist, daily home exercises and strategies to maximise adherence.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire (MHQ) overall hand function subscale score at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included the full MHQ, pain, health-related quality of life (Short Form questionnaire-12 items), impairment (grip strength, dexterity and range of motion) and self-efficacy. European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, medication and health-care use were collected for the health economics evaluation. Follow-up was at 4 and 12 months post randomisation. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.
RESULTS: We randomised 490 patients (244 to usual care, 246 to exercise programme). Compliance with the treatments was very good (93% of usual care participants and 75% of exercise programme participants completed treatment). Outcomes were obtained for 89% of participants at 12 months (222 for usual care, 216 for exercise programme). There was a statistically significant difference in favour of the exercise programme for the primary outcome at 4 and 12 months [mean difference 4.6 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2 to 7.0 points; and mean difference 4.4 points, 95% CI 1.6 to 7.1 points, respectively]. There were no significant differences in pain scores or adverse events. The estimated difference in mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued over 12 months was 0.01 greater (95% CI -0.03 to 0.05) in the exercise programme group. Imputed analysis produced incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates of ¬£17,941 (0.59 probability of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay threshold of ¬£30,000 per QALY). The qualitative study found the exercise programme to be acceptable and highlighted the importance of the therapist in enabling patients to establish a routine and incorporate the exercises into their lives.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the Strengthening And stretching for Rheumatoid Arthritis of the Hand trial suggest that the addition of an exercise programme for RA hands/wrists to usual care is clinically effective and cost-effective when compared with usual care alone. No adverse effects were associated with the exercise programme. The economic analysis suggests that the intervention is likely to be cost-effective.

Both medications were equally effective and generally well tolerated. No significant differences were found between drug groups. Both groups showed statistically significant improvement in the overall number of swollen and tender joints, painful joint count, and the patients' assessment of pain and disease severity. Two (9%) of 23 patients in the diflunisal group and one (5%) of 21 patients in the piroxicam group reported adverse effects. Only one patient withdrew from the study because of side effects (lightheadedness during use of diflunisal). It is concluded that both diflunisal and piroxicam are highly effective and generally well tolerated in the management of rheumatoid arthritis."

DESIGN: retrieval of data from a 2-year open randomised trial comparing prednisolone 7.5 mg/day in addition to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with DMARD therapy alone. Participants were followed for 10 years since inclusion into the original prednisolone trial or until occurrence of the studied outcomes.
SETTING: secondary level of care; six participating centres from southern Sweden; both urban and rural populations.
PARTICIPANTS: overall, 223 patients with early RA were included. The participants had no history of CV events at baseline and incident cases were identified via the Swedish Hospital Discharge and Cause of Death Registries.
OUTCOMES: composite CV events, that is, ischaemic coronary and cerebrovascular events, components of the composite CV outcome, and death. Relative HRs from Cox proportional-hazards regression models were calculated.
RESULTS: within 2041 person-years, 17 incident composite CV events occurred in 112 patients (15%) randomised to prednisolone, and 15 events of 111 patients (14%) who were assigned not to receive prednisolone. There were nine deaths (8%) in each group. The age-adjusted relative hazards (HRs; 95% CI) for the first composite CV event, first coronary event and death in the prednisolone group versus the group not treated with prednisolone were 1.8 (0.9 to 3.6), 0.98 (0.4 to 2.6) and 1.6 (0.6 to 4.1), respectively. The risk for the first cerebrovascular event showed a 3.7-fold increased relative hazard (95% CI 1.2 to 11.4) among prednisolone treated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: in this inception cohort study of low-dose prednisolone use during the first 2 years of RA disease, the incidence of ischaemic coronary artery events was similar in the two treatment groups, whereas the long-term risk of ischaemic cerebrovascular events was higher in the prednisolone group. There was a trend towards reduced survival in the prednisolone group.

Arthroscopic lavage or arthrocentesis was performed in a random manner in 142 patients with relapsing rheumatoid arthritis. All patients were followed up for 24 months. Intra-articular lavage with 5 l (p < 0.01) or 3 l (p < 0.05) of saline gave better clinical results than did arthrocentesis. There was no significant difference between the cumulative incidence of recurrence of knee synovitis in patients who underwent arthrocentesis and that in patients who underwent lavage with 1 l of saline. Cox regression analysis showed that patients with knee arthritis of more than 6 months in duration and with Larsen grade II or less were more responsive to lavage with 5 or 3 l of saline. The duration of the effect of lavage with 3 l of saline was increased 2.9-fold (p = 0.04) by injection of both steroids and high molecular weight hyaluronan. No bleeding or infectious complications occurred after those procedures. Arthroscopic lavage with 5 l of saline is safe and has good therapeutic effects for rheumatoid knees with mild destruction in which arthritis has persisted for more than 6 months. Lavage with 3 l of saline is recommended when intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and high molecular weight hyaluronan is performed after lavage.

Results of the covariance analysis for all patients who completed the trial showed no significant differences (P less than 0.05) in efficacy between the two groups. The proportions of patients showing 50% or greater improvement in tender joints, swollen joints, activity index, severity of pain, general health rating, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were similar for both auranofin-treated and GST-treated patients who completed the 48-week trial.

Efficient, low-cost measures are required for optimal monitoring of medication adherence in the rheumatology clinic. Self-report tools are the most efficient and cost-effective measures available. Recently, a 5-item version of the Compliance Questionnaire Rheumatology (CQR5) was developed from the original 19-item version to reduce patient burden. Reliability of the CQR5 over time has not yet been evaluated. Therefore, in a sample of RA patients, we evaluated reliability of the CQR5 against that of the 9-item Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS9), another short medication adherence tool that was recently shown to be reliable in a sample of RA patients. Methods: RA patients (disease duration > 1 year) taking at least one DMARD prescription were randomly selected from a rheumatology outpatient clinic database. Patients were assessed at baseline and two weeks. Demographic data were collected at baseline. At each visit, medication adherence was assessed with the CQR5 and MARS9. Each item on the CQR5 was scored on a four point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree). Scores for each item were then summed into a total score which varied between 5 and 20. For the MARS9, each item was scored on a five point Likert scale (1 = always, 5 = never) and item scores were summed into a total score ranging from 9 to 45. On both questionnaires, higher scores indicated greater adherence. Reliability analysis was performed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the mean difference between measurements obtained at baseline and two weeks. Results: 100 RA patients, , were recruited. 4 patients dropped out, therefore 96 were included in the analysis. In this sample, the CQR5 and MARS9 demonstrated excellent and fair to good test-retest reliability, respectively [ICCCQR5 = 0.78 (CI95% = 0.69-0.85), p < 0.01; ICCMARS9 = 0.57 (CI95% = 0.42-0.69), p < 0.01]. The differences in measurement between baseline and two weeks for the CQR5 [mean (SD) = -0.13(1.40)] and MARS9 [mean (SD) = -0.20(4.32)] were not significantly different (p > 0.05). However, the CQR5 had a lower and less variable mean difference than the MARS9, indicating greater consistency across measurements for this instrument. Conclusion: we demonstrated that the CQR5 is a more reliable measure of medication adherence than the MARS9 in RA patients when it is used in a rheumatology clinic setting. A more in-depth investigation of the CQR5, including its validation against a gold standard, is currently underway. Supported by a CIORA grant"

METHODS: A double blind, randomized study of 6 months' duration was conducted at the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India. One hundred and thirty-two patients with active RA (defined by the 1987 ARA criteria) were entered into the study and randomized into 3 groups: phenytoin, chloroquine, or auranofin.
RESULTS: Full data were evaluable in 100 patients who satisfactorily completed the protocol (phenytoin, 35; auranofin, 30; and chloroquine, 35). Twenty-four patients were noncompliant and did not take medication or return for evaluation; 8 patients had the drug withdrawn because of side effects before study completion. For each of the 3 drugs all clinical and laboratory variables improved when pre and posttreatment values (p < 0.05 to 0.001) were compared. There was a greater reduction in posttreatment mean morning stiffness in the chloroquine group than in the phenytoin and auranofin groups (p < 0.05). Posttreatment grip strength was also greatest in the chloroquine group. On the other hand, there were statistically significant decreases in IgM levels in both the phenytoin and auranofin groups (p < 0.001), but not with chloroquine. Among the 53 patients with a disease history of 3-6 months, global outcome was best with phenytoin (16/17), compared to chloroquine (12/18) and auranofin (12/18) (p < 0.03). However, there was no such difference in the 47 patients in all 3 groups with a disease history longer than 6 months. Eight patients had side effects (phenytoin, auranofin, 2; chloroquine, 1) requiring withdrawal of the drug. However, the incidence of side effects was not significantly different for the 3 drugs.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that phenytoin is comparable to auranofin and chloroquine in its efficacy in RA and may be considered an alternative disease modifying agent for RA."

METHODS: double-blind, randomized, placebo and active comparator-controlled, 12-week study conducted at 67 sites in 28 countries. Eligible patients were chronic NSAID users who demonstrated a clinical worsening of arthritis upon withdrawal of prestudy NSAIDs. Patients received either placebo, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily, or naproxen 500 mg twice daily (2: 2: 1 allocation ratio). Primary efficacy measures included direct assessment of arthritis by counts of tender and swollen joints, and patient and investigator global assessments of disease activity. Key secondary measures included the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, patient global assessment of pain, and the percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response (a composite of pain, inflammation, function, and global assessments). Tolerability was assessed by adverse events and routine laboratory evaluations.
RESULTS: 1171 patients were screened, 891 patients were randomized (N = 357 for placebo, N = 353 for etoricoxib, and N = 181 for naproxen), and 687 completed 12 weeks of treatment (N = 242 for placebo, N = 294 for etoricoxib, and N = 151 for naproxen). Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving etoricoxib and naproxen showed significant improvements in all efficacy endpoints (p<0.05). Treatment responses were similar between the etoricoxib and naproxen groups for all endpoints. The percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 responder criteria response was 41% in the placebo group, 59% in the etoricoxib group, and 58% in the naproxen group. Etoricoxib and naproxen were both generally well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: in this study, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily was more effective than placebo and similar in efficacy to naproxen 500 mg twice daily for treating patients with RA over 12 weeks. Etoricoxib 90 mg was generally well tolerated in RA patients."

9258122,,10.1523/jneurosci.4893-07.2008,"Conditions with chronically elevated glucocorticoid levels are usually associated with declarative memory deficits. Considerable evidence suggests that long-term glucocorticoid exposure may cause cognitive impairment via cumulative and long-lasting influences on hippocampal function and morphology. However, because elevated glucocorticoid levels at the time of retention testing are also known to have direct impairing effects on memory retrieval, it is possible that such acute hormonal influences on retrieval processes contribute to the memory deficits found with chronic glucocorticoid exposure. To investigate this issue, we examined memory functions and hippocampal volume in 24 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated either chronically (5.3 +/- 1.0 years, mean +/- SE) with low to moderate doses of prednisone (7.5 +/- 0.8 mg, mean +/- SE) or without glucocorticoids. In both groups, delayed recall of words learned 24 h earlier was assessed under conditions of either elevated or basal glucocorticoid levels in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Although the findings in this patient population did not provide evidence for harmful effects of a history of chronic prednisone treatment on memory performance or hippocampal volume per se, acute prednisone administration 1 h before retention testing to either the steroid or nonsteroid group impaired word recall. Thus, these findings indicate that memory deficits observed under chronically elevated glucocorticoid levels result, at least in part, from acute and reversible glucocorticoid effects on memory retrieval."

To evaluate the longterm efficacy and safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ-SC) every 2 weeks (q2w) over 2 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD). Methods. Patients (n = 656) were randomized 2: 1 to TCZ-SC 162 mg q2w or placebo-SC q2w plus DMARD. After a 24-week double-blind period, patients (n = 457) were rerandomized to open-label TCZ-SC q2w by means of prefilled syringe or autoinjector. Escape therapy with weekly TCZ-SC was available for patients with inadequate efficacy from Week 12. Maintenance of response and safety to 2 years was assessed. Analyses used nonresponder imputation. Results. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response after TCZ-SC was maintained beyond Week 24 and was > 70% at each timepoint. ACR50/70, 28-joint Disease Activity Score remission, and >= 0.30 decrease from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index response rates were also maintained after Week 24 in the TCZ-SC arm (>= 50%, > 25%,> 32% and > 56%, respectively). Following escape for inadequate efficacy, many patients achieved ACR20 at the end of the study, 35% after escape from TCZ-SC, and 63% from placebo. The rates of serious adverse events [(11.20/100 patient-years (PY)] including serious infections (3.25/100 PY) were stable through Week 96. No association between anti-TCZ antibody development and loss of efficacy or adverse events was observed. Conclusion. Efficacy and safety of TCZ-SC q2w was maintained up to 2 years and remained comparable with previously published data for intravenous TCZ.

After an initial wash-out period (3-4 days) without any treatment, each patient was given all three different treatments in a random sequence, over a period of 3 consecutive weeks, with balancing of the sequences for groups of 6 patients. The treatments were given in a double-placebo regime, in four daily doses, after the main meals. The total dose of indoprofen (tablets) was equivalent to 800 mg/day and the total dose of indomethacin (capsules) was 100 mg/day. In each of the hospital centers, the evaluations were always made by the same investigator and at the same time in the morning. The analysis of the results obtained in 68 cases, collected in 18 centers, showed a statistically significant difference between the effects of the two active drugs and those of the placebo, for a series of objective and subjective criteria for evaluation of the effectiveness. IP was not significantly different from IM, even though factorial analysis showed a greater difference between IP and the placebo than between IM and the placebo. In addition, the overall preference of the patients suggested IP at 800 mg/day to be slightly better than IM at 100 mg/day. Adverse reactions, which were never very marked, were observed in 11.4% of the patients while they were being treated with IM, in 4.3% of the patients during IP treatment and in 1.5% during placebo treatment. There were no significant changes in any of the laboratory variables used as indices of tolerability, at any time during the treatment period. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam.

METHODS: Ten patients with accelerated nodulosis were studied. Four participated in a double blind study of MTX and azathioprine. Patient characteristics, localization, size and histopathology of new nodules were determined. Echocardiography and chest roentgenograms were performed.
RESULTS: Accelerated nodulosis occurred exclusively during treatment with MTX in our double blind study. The estimated incidence was 8%. One patient reported was rheumatoid factor negative. Newly developed nodules were small, and located in the fingers in all patients and in additional sites in 7. Pretreatment nodules were not found in the fingers. In one patient nodules on the mitral valve were found, but this was not likely to be associated with the use of MTX. No new pulmonary nodules were found. Other EAM developed concurrently in 4 patients. Histopathology revealed typical rheumatoid nodules. In 3 patients nodulosis regressed after MTX was stopped. In 2 of them they recurred after a rechallenge.
CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated nodulosis during MTX for RA is not rare, and occurs despite good clinical response of polyarthritis. Rheumatoid factor positivity is not a prerequisite. New nodules are small and preferentially located in the fingers. Recurrence after rechallenge with MTX suggests causality."
9258173,,10.2196/jmir.3510,"BACKGROUND: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is chronic systematic disease that affects people during the most productive period of their lives. Web-based health interventions have been effective in many studies; however, there is little evidence and few studies showing the effectiveness of online social support and especially gamification on patients' behavioral and health outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to look into the effects of a Web-based intervention that included online social support features and gamification on physical activity, health care utilization, medication overuse, empowerment, and RA knowledge of RA patients. The effect of gamification on website use was also investigated.
METHODS: we conducted a 5-arm parallel randomized controlled trial for RA patients in Ticino (Italian-speaking part of Switzerland). A total of 157 patients were recruited through brochures left with physicians and were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 experimental conditions with different types of access to online social support and gamification features and a control group that had no access to the website. Data were collected at 3 time points through questionnaires at baseline, posttest 2 months later, and at follow-up after another 2 months. Primary outcomes were physical activity, health care utilization, and medication overuse; secondary outcomes included empowerment and RA knowledge. All outcomes were self-reported. Intention-to-treat analysis was followed and multilevel linear mixed models were used to study the change of outcomes over time.
RESULTS: the best-fit multilevel models (growth curve models) that described the change in the primary outcomes over the course of the intervention included time and empowerment as time-variant predictors. The growth curve analyses of experimental conditions were compared to the control group. Physical activity increased over time for patients having access to social support sections plus gaming (unstandardized beta coefficient =3.39, P=.02). Health care utilization showed a significant decrease for patients accessing social support features (B=-0.41, P=.01) and patients accessing both social support features and gaming (B=-0.33, P=.03). Patients who had access to either social support sections or the gaming experience of the website gained more empowerment (B=2.59, P=.03; B=2.29, P=.05; respectively). Patients who were offered a gamified experience used the website more often than the ones without gaming (t91=-2.41, P=.02; U=812, P=.02).
CONCLUSIONS: the Web-based intervention had a positive impact (more desirable outcomes) on intervention groups compared to the control group. Social support sections on the website decreased health care utilization and medication overuse and increased empowerment. Gamification alone or with social support increased physical activity and empowerment and decreased health care utilization. This study provides evidence demonstrating the potential positive effect of gamification and online social support on health and behavioral outcomes.

9258219,,10.1186/s12891-015-0817-6,"BACKGROUND: Recommendations for rheumatology nursing management of chronic inflammatory arthritis (CIA) from European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) states that nurses should take part in the monitoring patients' disease and therapy in order to achieve cost savings. The aim of the study was to compare the costs of rheumatology care between a nurse-led rheumatology clinic (NLC), based on person-centred care (PCC), versus a rheumatologist-led clinic (RLC), in monitoring of patients with CIA undergoing biological therapy. METHODS: Patients with CIA undergoing biological therapy (n = 107) and a Disease Activity Score of 28 = 3.2 were randomised to follow-up by either NLC or RLC. All patients met the rheumatologist at inclusion and after 12 months. In the intervention one of two annual monitoring visits in an RLC was replaced by a visit to an NLC. The primary outcome was total annual cost of rheumatology care. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients completed the RCT at the 12 month follow-up. Replacing one of the two annual rheumatologist monitoring visits by a nurse-led monitoring visit, resulted in no additional contacts to the rheumatology clinic, but rather a decrease in the use of resources and a reduction of costs. The total annual rheumatology care costs including fixed monitoring, variable monitoring, rehabilitation, specialist consultations, radiography, and pharmacological therapy, generated euro 14107.7 per patient in the NLC compared with euro 16274.9 in the RCL (p = 0.004), giving a euro 2167.2 (13 %) lower annual cost for the NLC. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CIA and low disease activity or in remission undergoing biological therapy can be monitored with a reduced resource use and at a lower annual cost by an NLC, based on PCC with no difference in clinical outcomes. This could free resources for more intensive monitoring of patients early in the disease or patients with high disease activity.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce morning stiffness, the number of tender joints and swollen joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This study is designed for evaluation of omega-3 effects on disease activity and remission of rheumatoid arthritis in DMARDs treated patients and on weight changes and reduction of analgesic drugs consumption versus placebo.
METHODS: sixty patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (49 female and 11 male) underwent rheumatologist examination and disease activity score were calculated. Then patients were enrolled in this 12 week, double blind, randomized, placebo- controlled study. The patients in both groups continued their pre study standard treatment. The patients were visited every 4 weeks, 4 times and data were recorded.
RESULTS: significant improvement in the patient's global evaluation and in the physician's assessment of disease was observed in those taking omega-3. The proportions of patients who improved and of those who were able to reduce their concomitant analgesic medication were significantly greater with omega-3 consumption. There were no weight changes.
CONCLUSION: daily supplementation with omega-3 results has significant clinical benefit and may reduce the need for concomitant analgesic consumption without weight changes."

Methods: the SCOOP study is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial involving 12 483 eligible women aged 70- 85 years, identified within primary care, followed over a 5 year period. The women were evaluated by questionnaire and randomised to a control or screening arm. Data from both control and screening arms combined were analysed by logistic regression using SPSS v.22. Results: at baseline, 3444 (27.6 %) of the women reported a history of falls in the previous year. Compared to non-fallers, those with a history of falls were older (mean 76.0 vs. 75.4 years, p < 0.001) and had a higher BMI (mean 27.1 vs. 26.5, p< 0.0001). Fallers reported a higher prevalence of the following FRAX risk factors: prior fracture, parental history of hip fracture, alcohol use, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, and secondary osteoporosis. During follow-up, fallers had a higher risk of mortality (OR= 1.36, p = 0.000, 95 %, CI= 1.19-1.60) and osteoporotic fracture (OR= 1.32, p = 0.000, 95 % CI = 1.18-1.48). This predictive ability persisted following adjustment for all of the variables included in Frax (i.e. osteoporotic fracture OR= 1.29, p=0.047, 95% CI= 1.00-1.65 and mortality OR= 1.51, p = 0.006, CI= 1.12- 2.04). Conclusion: there are baseline differences in fallers and non-fallers. A history of falls predicts for osteoporotic fractures in women 70-85 years of age in the UK. Identifying those at highest risk for falls and fractures may enable targeting of exercise, nutritional and/or pharmacological interventions to reduce the burden of disease and improve healthy ageing"
9258240,,10.1186/s12969-015-0034-8,"BACKGROUND: intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACI) are routinely used by pediatric rheumatologists in the treatment of chronic arthritis. Frequently, topical anesthetics are used to control procedural pain, but their relative efficacy has not been reported. In this study, we evaluated the level of pain associated with different anesthetic methods, Numby¬Æ 900 Iontophoretic Drug Delivery System, or EMLA¬Æ cream, with or without subcutaneous buffered lidocaine (SQBL), during IACI of the knee in children with arthritis.
METHODS: we conducted a prospective study of patients, ages 4 to 21¬†years old, followed at three pediatric rheumatology centers who were undergoing IACI of a knee joint. Patients were randomized into two treatment groups: 1) topical anesthetic only (EMLA¬Æ or Numby¬Æ (E/N)), or 2) topical anesthetic (E/N) and SQBL. Pain was assessed at baseline, during topical anesthetic placement, and following the IACI (post-procedure).

METHODS: Patients with active RA were enrolled in a 6 month, double blind, placebo controlled, dual center, dose escalation (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg) study. Subjects received a total of 13 intravenous ISIS 2302 infusions, given on alternate days for 2 weeks and then 3 times a week for another 2 weeks. Doses of corticosteroids (< or = 10 mg/day) and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (stable > or = 3 months) remained constant throughout the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the Day 26 Paulus index, with secondary evaluations at Months 2-6.
RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were enrolled with 11, 10, 3, and 19 patients receiving placebo or 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg of ISIS 2302, respectively. There were no differences between groups after randomization and the mean baseline swollen joint count was 22.5. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a T(1/2) of 63 min and first-order kinetics with slight dose dependency, suggesting a saturable clearance process, although no accumulation was noted with repeat dosing. The Paulus 20% responses at Day 26 were 20%, 0%, and 5% for patients treated with ISIS 2302 (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg, respectively) and 36% with placebo. For Months 2-6, the average intent-to-treat Paulus 20% responses were 21.2% for ISIS 2302 and 12.6% for placebo. Only ISIS 2302 treated subjects (19%) achieved Paulus 50% responses. ISIS 2302 was well tolerated. An expected and transient mean activated partial thromboplastin time increase of roughly 7 s was observed at the highest dose (2 mg/kg), as were small and clinically insignificant increases in serum C3a levels. T/B cell immunophenotyping, recall antigen skin testing, and serum immunoglobulin levels revealed no significant immunosuppressive effects.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that 13 ISIS 2302 infusions over 4 weeks are well tolerated in patients with active RA. Although significant efficacy was not evident at the primary endpoint (1 month), the study lacked sufficient power to draw any formal conclusions. We tested a 4-fold drug concentration range, which led to a lower area under the curve range than was therapeutic in a subsequent Crohn's disease trial. Any further evaluation of this well tolerated ICAM-1 antisense agent should therefore be conducted at higher dosing."
9258259,,10.1371/journal.pone.0113465,"OBJECTIVES: Active immunization, or vaccination, with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Kinoid (TNF-K) is a novel approach to induce polyclonal anti-TNF antibodies in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. This study was performed to transfer the proof of concept obtained in mice model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) into human. We designed a pilot study to demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic vaccination in RA.
METHODS: This was a phase IIa, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adults with RA who previously experienced secondary failure of TNF antagonists. Patients were immunized intramuscularly with 2 or 3 doses of placebo (n‚Ää=‚Ää10) or 90 (n‚Ää=‚Ää6), 180 (n‚Ää=‚Ää12), or 360 ¬µg TNF-K (n‚Ää=‚Ää12). The primary objective was to identify the best dose and schedule based on anti-TNF antibody titers. Clinical symptoms and safety were assessed during 12 months and solicited reactions for 7 days after each injection.
RESULTS: The highest anti-TNF antibody response was detected in patients immunized with 360 ¬µg TNF-K and with 3 injections, although this difference was not significant with all other groups. Similar proportions of patients receiving TNF-K and placebo reported adverse events up to month 12. Serious adverse events were reported by 4 patients treated with TNF-K (13.3%) and 3 treated with placebo (30.0%), all unrelated to treatment. At month 12, DAS28-CRP, tender and swollen joint counts, and HAQ scores decreased significantly more in patients who exhibited anti-TNF antibody response than in patients who did not.
CONCLUSIONS: TNF-K therapeutic vaccination induced dose- and schedule-dependent anti-TNF antibodies in RA patients and was well tolerated. Patients who developed anti-TNF antibodies showed a trend toward clinical improvement. Although the most aggressive dose and schedule, i.e. 360 mg dose administered 3 times, did show a strong trend of higher antibody response, further studies are warranted to examine even higher and more frequent doses in order to establish the best conditions for clinical improvement.

Twenty-seven RA patients, who presented with hyposideremic anemia and were randomly allocated to three groups, were involved in the study. Trial duration was six weeks, subdivided into 15-day periods: an initial phase, during which each treatment group received one of three above-mentioned trial treatments (phase 1), was followed by a washout period (phase 2), and successively by a course of iron therapy in each group (phase 3). Laboratory parameters (ie, hemoglobin, serum iron, unsaturated iron binding capacity, serum ferritin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and clinical parameters (ie, morning stiffness and pain at rest) were assessed before trial entry and at the end of each trial phase. While both of these parameters showed an improvement in patients treated with DFX with or without iron, no improvement was recorded in those patients receiving iron therapy alone. DFX therapy was noted to have a more pronounced antianemic effect than DFX plus iron. The clinical safety of DFX, both objective and subjective, was also investigated, and at the dosage schedules adopted the drug was well tolerated. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam.

Before treatment and after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 months IgA, IgG, IgM and caeruloplasmin were estimated with the immunodiffusion technique. In both groups the IgA and IgG levels remained unchanged; under D penicillamine, on the contrary, a statistically significant and continuous fall of IgM and caeruloplasmin was observed; prednisolone treatment induced only a temporary fall of caeruloplasmin. In the DPA treated patients, a significant correlation of IgM with caeruloplasmin and of caeruloplasmin with ESR was found. In both groups there was no correlation between joint count and caeruloplasmin, joint count and IgM, caeruloplasmin and copper, copper and ESR; in the prednisolone group no correlation between caeruloplasmin, ESR and IgM was observed. The correlations suggest that the remarkable fall of IgM and caeruloplasmin under D(-)penicillamine treatment is caused at least partially by the direct interference of DPA with these plasma proteins.

The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of golimumab in healthy male Chinese subjects following a single subcutaneous (SC) administration of golimumab 50 or 100 mg. The safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single SC administration of golimumab in Chinese subjects were also evaluated.
METHODS: This was a phase I, randomized, open-label, single-dose, single-period, single-center study. Twenty-four healthy male Chinese subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive a single SC administration of golimumab 50 or 100 mg. Serial blood samples for the measurement of serum golimumab concentrations were collected and analyzed using a validated electrochemiluminescent immunoassay method. The pharmacokinetic parameters [maximum observed serum concentration (C(max)), time to reach C(max) (t(max)), area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC‚àû), and terminal half-life (t(¬Ω))] of golimumab were derived using a noncompartmental analysis.
RESULTS: Following a single SC administration of golimumab 50 or 100 mg in Chinese male subjects (age 19-41 years, body weight 60-76 kg), mean ¬± standard deviation C(max) (3.6 ¬± 1.6 and 7.5 ¬± 1.4 Œºg/mL, respectively) and AUC‚àû (59.8 ¬± 19.8 and 132.8 ¬± 27.0 Œºg¬∑day/mL, respectively) increased in a dose-proportional manner. The median t(max) was in the range of 4.5-5.0 days, and the mean t(¬Ω) was in the range of 10.8-11.9 days. Among 24 subjects, 23 had appropriate samples for evaluation of antibodies to golimumab, and one subject (1/23, 4.3%) in the 100-mg group tested positive. Three mild adverse events were reported (infected sebaceous cyst, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache), all in the 50-mg group; none were considered to be related to the study agent.
CONCLUSIONS: Golimumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics at dose levels of 50 and 100 mg following a single SC administration in healthy Chinese subjects. Single SC administrations of golimumab 50 or 100 mg were considered to be generally well tolerated. The results from this study indicate that there are no apparent ethnic differences in the pharmacokinetics of golimumab between Chinese and Caucasian subjects."

Sixty patients (25 males, 35 females; aged 27-60 years) with rheumatoid arthritis were included in the study. These patients were divided into two groups of 30. Group A received aceclofenac (2 X 100 mg tablets daily) and Group B received placebo (2 tablets daily) for 14 days. The patients were examined in the out-patients' clinic before starting treatment, and after seven and 14 days treatment. After seven and 14 days, the intensity of pain at rest (p < 0.001), pain during movement (p < 0.001) and pain due to pressure on the joint (p < 0.001) improved significantly in the group receiving aceclofenac; the duration of morning stiffness and degree of disability were also less (p < 0.001). Tolerance to aceclofenac was good; occasionally some patients on the drug found it necessary to take antacids. No serious side-effects were noted. Only one patient from each group withdrew from the study. It is concluded that aceclofenac is a good alternative in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam.

In animal models of arthritis, treatment with recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11) reduces both the level of synovitis and the histologic lesion scores in the joints. The goal of this phase-I/II study in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of different doses and schedules of rhIL-11 in patients with active RA for whom treatment with at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug had failed. This was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the safety and tolerability of rhIL-11 in 91 patients with active RA. rhIL-11 was administered subcutaneously; patients were randomized into one of five treatment groups (ratio of rhIL-11 to placebo, 4:1). Patients were treated for 12 weeks with either 2.5 or 7.5 microg/kg of rhIL-11 or placebo twice per week or 5 or 15 microg/kg of rhIL-11 or placebo once per week. The status of each subject's disease activity in accordance with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria was assessed before, during, and after completion of administration of the study drug. Administration of rhIL-11 was well tolerated at all doses and schedules. The most frequent adverse event was a reaction at the injection site. The data suggest a statistically significant reduction in the number of tender joints (P < 0.008) at the 15 microg/kg once-weekly dose schedule but showed no overall significant benefit at the ACR criterion of a 20% response. The trial showed rhIL-11 to be safe and well tolerated at a variety of doses and schedules over a 12-week treatment period in patients with active RA.

9258325,http://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-019-0471-8,10.1038/s41380-019-0471-8,"Background: inflammatory and immune biomarker abnormalities have been reported in primary mood disorders, and the prevalence of major depressive episodes increases in some medical conditions that involve activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways. Moreover, while preliminary data suggest that anti-inflammatory or immune modulating drugs may alleviate depressive symptoms, it remains unclear which molecular targets may hold the greatest promise for yielding novel antidepressant treatments. A variety of immune system-targeting compounds have been tested in clinical trials for inflammatory disorders and cancers. Here we perform a meta-analysis of 18 placebocontrolled, randomized, double-blind clinical trials conducted by Janssen and GlaxoSmithKline for immunology or oncology indications (N = 10,745) to explore whether improvement in depressive symptoms occurred with immune modulating therapies, and if so, whether specific treatment mechanisms afforded greater antidepressant efficacy than others. To the extent possible we attempted to distinguish antidepressant effects from improvement in the peripheral signs and symptoms of the primary disorder. Methods: we assessed data collected on 9 compounds and 7 molecular targets (IL-6, TNF-a, IL12/23, CD20, COX2, BLgS and p38/MAPK14) in patients being treated for 9 diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, asthma, osteoarthritis of the knee, neuropathic pain, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multicentric Castleman's disease. Two core depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia) were measured on the SF-36 Health Survey, version 2.0. Patients were designated as having highdepressive symptoms at baseline (HDS, N = 1,921 patients), meaning one of the depressive symptoms was present at least 'most of the time' and the other at least 'some of the time' for four weeks. One study rated the severity of depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, in which case a cutoff of HADS-D4 = 11 was used. The treated arm was defined as receiving any active dose; the placebo arm was defined as in each original study, and was typically combined with standard of care. Changes in depressive symptoms from baseline to post-treatment (4-16 weeks, depending on study) were evaluated directly and with adjustment for symptom severity of the primary disease using a mixed-effects model with repeated measures. Fixedeffects included treatment group, visit, and interaction between treatment group and visit. Analysis was also performed within patients designated as non-responders to the primary disease. Treatment effects were assessed across all studies, and grouped by drug mechanism, using the standardized mean difference (SMD, or Cohen's d), to compare the change in depressive symptom improvement in the treatment vs. placebo arm using the R package metafor. For a subset of studies, baseline CRP levels were available for correlation with percentage of patients with HDS, estimation of mean differences between HDS and LDS groups, and correlation with improvement in depressive symptoms. Results: the fraction of patients with high depressive symptoms varied across trials, and was significantly higher in the rheumatoid arthritis studies compared with the aggregate of all non-RA studies (p = 0.004, 2-sided t-test). Average baseline CRP was significantly correlated with the percentage of patients with HDS at baseline (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.57, p = 0.04). The overall pooled effect, taking together all 18 studies, showed greater improvement in the treated arm than the placebo arm (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI = ; z = 3.35, p<0.001). The significance of the overall treatment effect on mood symptoms was maintained after adjusting for changes in primary disease severity, and also in the primary disease non-responder subgroup considered alone. Comparing effect size across drug mechanism shows some variability, with COX-2 inhibitors numerically, though not significantly, favoring placebo (SMD =-0.15 [-0.37-0.07]; z = 1.3; p = 0.17); p38/MAPK14 antagonist having no effect (SMD = 0.05 [-0.54-0.65]; z = 0.18; p = 0.86), and IL-6 antagonists (SMD = 0.80 [0.20-1.41]; z = 2.6; p = o0.01) and IL12/23 antagonist (SMD = 0.74 [0.52-0.96]; z = 6.5; p<0.0001) showing the largest effect sizes. After adjusting for primary disease symptom severity the effects were smaller, but trends were preserved with the largest effect sizes for the IL-6 antagonists (SMD = 0.56 [-0.04-1.16]; z = 1.8; p = 0.07) and the IL12/23 antagonist (SMD = 0.57 [0.35-0.79]; z = 5.1; p<0.0001). Within primary disease non-responders, not adjusting for symptom severity, similar trends were observed although significance was reduced as sample size was smaller (IL-6: SMD = 0.88 [0.16-1.59]; z = 2.4, p = 0.017; and IL12/23: SMD = 0.53 [-0.19-1.25], Z = 1.44, p = 0.15). Conclusions: these results demonstrate that some antiinflammatory or immune modulating drugs have statistically significant, clinically moderate anti-depressant effects in patients with inflammatory disorders and high depressive symptoms at baseline. These effects were not simply attributable to improved physical symptom severity scores and appeared stronger for anti-IL6 and anti-IL12/23 mechanisms of action"

Patients with RA have a decreased functional ability and are forced into a sedentary lifestyle and as such, these patients often become predisposed to poor bone health. Patients with RA may also experience a decreased health related quality of life (HRQoL) due to their disease. Whole body vibration (WBV) is a form of exercise that stimulates bone loading through forced oscillation. WBV has also been shown to decrease pain and fatigue in other rheumatic diseases, as well as to increase muscle strength. This paper reports on the development of a semi randomised controlled clinical trial to assess the impact of a WBV intervention aiming to improve functional ability, attenuate bone loss, and improve habitual physical activity levels in patients with RA.
METHODS/DESIGN: this study is a semi randomised, controlled trial consisting of a cohort of patients with established RA assigned to either a WBV group or a CON (control) group. Patients in the WBV group will undergo three months of twice weekly intermittent WBV sessions, while the CON group will receive standard care and continue with normal daily activities. All patients will be assessed at baseline, following the three month intervention, and six months post intervention. Main outcomes will be an improvement in functional ability as assessed by the HAQ. Secondary outcomes are attenuation of loss of bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip and changes in RA disease activity, HRQoL, habitual physical activity levels and body composition.
DISCUSSION: this study will provide important information regarding the effects of WBV on functional ability and BMD in patients with RA, as well as novel data regarding the potential changes in objective habitual physical activity patterns that may occur following the intervention. The sustainability of the intervention will also be assessed.

This affects physical as well as mental wellbeing and leads to severely reduced quality of life and reduced work capacity, thus yielding high individual as well as societal costs. As a complement to modern pharmacological treatment, lifestyle intervention should be evaluated as a treatment option. Scientific evidence exists for anti-inflammatory effects by single foods on RA, but no study exists where these foods have been combined to obtain maximum effect and thus offer a substantial improvement in patient life quality. The main goal of the randomized cross-over trial ADIRA (Anti-inflammatory Diet In Rheumatoid Arthritis) is to test the hypothesis that an anti-inflammatory diet intervention, compared to a regular diet, will decrease disease activity and improve quality of life in patients with stable established RA. Methods: in total, 50 RA patients with moderate disease activity are randomized to receive initially either a portfolio diet based on several food items with suggested anti-inflammatory effects or a control diet during 2 x 10 weeks with 3 months wash-out between diets. Food bags are delivered weekly by a home food delivery chain and referred to as the fiber bag and the protein bag, respectively, to partially blind participants. Both groups continue with regular pharmacological treatment. Known food biomarkers will be analyzed to measure intervention compliance. Impact on disease severity (measured by DAS28, a composite score which predicts disability and progression of RA), risk markers for cardiovascular disease and quality of life are evaluated after each diet regimen. Metabolomics will be used to evaluate the potential to predict responders to dietary treatment. A health economic evaluation is also included. Discussion: the nutritional status of patients with RA often is poor and many ask their physician for diet advice. No evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with RA exist because of the paucity of well-conducted sufficiently large diet intervention trials. ADIRA is an efficacy study and will provide evidence as to whether dietary treatment of RA can reduce disease activity and improve quality of life as well as reduce individual and societal costs.

The therapeutic effect was assessed with a clinical score, 99mTc pertechnetate uptake measurements and plain X-rays. With regard to clinical parameters no statistical differences between the two groups were found, but results indicate a trend towards a better outcome in patients treated with 5 mCi. 99mTc uptake improved significantly in patients treated with the higher dose and not in the low dose group. Weighing ease of treatment and risk of side effects against the small difference in effectiveness, we conclude that the use of less than 5 mCi of 198Au may be justified. During the study the injection technique was changed, enabling a comparison of two methods. Leakage to lymph nodes and liver decreased when the needle was flushed with normal saline after administration of the radiocolloid."

Within a few days of discharge, 129 in-patient rheumatoid arthritics were clinically and psychologically assessed and allocated at random to 1 of 3 forms of follow-up care. The psychological assessment included measures of personality, non-psychotic psychiatric disturbance, and attitudes and beliefs. A year later all patients were reassessed. It was found that rheumatoid arthritics were more neurotic in personality, more likely to give socially desirable responses, and more prone to psychiatric disturbance, than the general population. Seropositive patients were less susceptible to psychiatric disturbance than seronegative patients. None of the psychological variables predicted disease activity, but those patients who rated themselves as 'slow, dependent, and weak' lost more time off work in the subsequent year."

Autoimmune disorders are over-represented in patients and relatives and changes in the concentration of circulating cytokines appear consistent in meta-analyses. However, attempts to improve symptoms of schizophrenia with antiinflammatory agents have produced inconsistent results. We reported that minocycline selectively improved negative symptoms when added to treatment as usual (TAU) for one year in early psychosis (PMID: 22526685) and this selective benefit survived a meta-analysis of the few studies (PMID: 27335660). A call by the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) enabled us to determine whether methotrexate with a different mechanism of anti-inflammatory action, might also improve negative or other symptoms. We used low dose methotrexate, an effective anti-inflammatory treatment for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The mechanism of action is thought to involve inhibition of purine metabolism and T-cell function whereas its high dose anti-cancer effects are mediated by its anti-folate action. Methods: the design and analysis plan were pre-registered (PMID: 25563714; NCT02074319). This was a double-blind placebo-controlled feasibility study of methotrexate (7.5mg weekly for 12 weeks) added to TAU in patients within 5 years of the onset of schizophrenia disorders. After screening, full clinical and safety assessments were carried out at randomization, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Cognitive assessments were carried out at randomisation and 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scales (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), EQ-5D quality of life scale and an insight scale. Cognitive assessments were: stroop test, block design, verbal and category fluency, Coughlan visual and verbal list learning. Safety assessments included blood counts and side effects scales in keeping with methotrexate monitoring standards. Statistics. Based on power calculation, we aimed to recruit 72 patients assuming a 10% drop-out giving 32 per group at 12 weeks. The intention to treat analysis determined group effects on 12 week clinical and cognitive outcomes covarying for baseline measures with attention to possible biases from drop-outs. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) estimated the effect of treatment on longitudinal outcomes. Results: 92 participants were randomised, 47 to placebo (PBO) and 45 to methotrexate (MTX) with respectively 39 and 37 completing 12 weeks of treatment. The 8 dropouts in each group were due to loss of contact or co-operation. 2 refused medication in the MTX group. There were no serious adverse events or obvious side-effect differences. There was no statistically significant effect of MTX on PANNS negative syndrome scores but the PANSS positive subscale improved more from baseline to 12 weeks on MTX  than on placebo [15.7(6.4) to 12.3 (6.3)] giving a MTX/PBO treatment effect beta-2.52; 95% CI (-4.65 to-0.39); p =.023. The corresponding treatment effect for the negative syndrome was beta-0.39; 95% CI (-2.01 to 1.23); p =0.64. The findings were confirmed by the GEE analysis. There was a significant treatment effect on GAF but not on CGI or quality of life. There were no significant effects of treatment on cognitive performance. WCC reduced slightly in the MTX group over 12 weeks producing a significant treatment effect compared to PBO. However, subsequent causal mediation analysis did not indicate a mediating role in improving positive symptoms. Conclusions: methotrexate appears to exert a selective benefit on positive symptoms of schizophrenia early in the disorder. There were no effects on negative symptoms or cognitive performance. This is in contrast with a possible benefit of minocycline on negative symptoms rather than positive. Minocycline and MTX have a variety of actions on the immune system and they are both effective in some autoimmune disorders although MTX may be more effective in RA and psoriasis. Minocycline, has a number of CNS interactions which may be more relevant to negative symptoms. The efficacy of MTX may point to a role of immune mechanisms in positive symptoms. MTX reduced WCC to a similar extent to that observed in a recent study in patients with RA (PMID: 27335660). This suggests that patients were compliant with medication. However, this index of immune suppression did not appear to have a mediating role in improvement. This study shows that a definitive RCT of MTX in schizophrenia is worthwhile and feasible, and it provides a clear basis for sample size estimation"

Pentoxifylline has been shown to inhibit TNFalpha and protect against arthritis. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of pentoxifylline in patients with RA. Patients and methods: Patients of either gender diagnosed as having RA based on American Rheumatism Association criteria who were symptomatic over the last 6 weeks and not receiving any disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were included. Patients received either pentoxifylline 400mg tablets three times daily or placebo for 24 weeks. They were evaluated by a 28-joint count before treatment and every 2 weeks after treatment for the first month and then at monthly intervals. At every visit, painful and tender joint count and score, pain intensity on a four-point scale and on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS), swollen joint count and score, and duration of morning stiffness were recorded. Results: A total of 53 patients (28 receiving pentoxifylline and 25 placebo) were enrolled in the study. Significant improvement in clinical and laboratory variables was noted with pentoxifylline compared with placebo. Both tender and swollen joint count reduced significantly from 16.8 + 2.6 to 12.7 + 3.4 and 9.5 + 4.4, and from 6.5 + 1.1 to 4.3 + 1.3 and 3.7 + 1.6 after 12 and 24 weeks, respectively, with pentoxifylline. Placebo did not decrease the above parameters. Pain intensity measured on the VAS reduced from 66.3 + 5.7 to 51.9 + 9.8mm with pentoxifylline after 24 weeks; however, there was an apparent increase in pain intensity with placebo. A statistically significant decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor immunoglobulin M, C-reactive protein and malondialdehyde was observed with pentoxifylline compared with placebo. The response rate was 57% with pentoxifylline compared with 19% with placebo. Conclusion: Pentoxifylline demonstrated significant antirheumatic activity in patients with RA. It significantly improved signs and symptoms of inflammation and disease activity. Pentoxifylline treatment reduced pain, swelling and joint tenderness."

It has been shown to be effective as an analgesic in a variety of conditions. In a 12-week double-blind controlled trial diflunisal was compared with naproxen (Naprosyn; Syntex) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Suitable efficacy data were only available at week 4 owing to a number of withdrawals from the naproxen group. Both drugs, however, produced improvement in all the indices measured. At week 12 the initial improvement in the diflunisal group was maintained. Side-effects from diflunisal were mainly related to the gastro-intestinal tract but were not of serious nature; tinnitus and deafness did not occur. Diflunisal is an effective analgesic and also has anit-inflammatory action. It is a useful addition to the range of aspirin derivatives available for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."

RESULTS: At entry, mean duration of RA was 3.5 years (range 1-7); ages were 21-78 years; patients were 71% female, 84% Caucasian, 67% rheumatoid factor (RF) positive; tender joint count was 29, swollen joint count 22, Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 49, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 2.44. There were 824 (57.5%) patients who completed >or= 6 months and had paired radiographs; 46% completed 48 weeks; 31%, 98 weeks; and 19%, 147 weeks. Months between paired radiographs (time in study) averaged 23.1 (range 6-36). Mean progression rates for total, erosion, and JSN scores (5.08, 2.53, and 2.54 units per year, respectively) were significantly associated with time in study, baseline RF, ESR, CRP, swollen joint count, presence of erosions at entry, and with 20% and 50% composite clinical responses. Painful joint count and RA duration were weakly associated only with progression of erosions. Progression rates were not associated with age, sex, corticosteroid use, or prior DMARD use. Patients who completed the 3-year trial had less severe disease activity and radiographic progression than those who dropped out.
CONCLUSION: In this 3-year prospective double-blind clinical trial that prohibited DMARD, retention rates (57.5%, 46%, 31%, and 19% at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 years) were similar to those in the non-DMARD-treated placebo groups of recent published studies. Radiographic progression rates are reported for 824 non-DMARD-treated patients during RA of 1-10 years' duration. This information may be useful as background information in the interpretation of longterm clinical trials that evaluate joint radiographic outcomes."

METHODS: fifty-eight rheumatoid arthritis patients (60 knees) with chronic knee synovitis participated in a controlled double-blinded trial. Patients were randomized to receive either an intra-articular injection with 40 mg triamcinolone hexacetonide alone (TH group) or 40 mg triamcinolone hexacetonide combined with 15 mci samarium(153)-particulate hydroxyapatite (sm/th group). Blinded examination at baseline (T0) and at 1 (T1), 4 (T4), 12 (T12), 32 (T32), and 48 (T48) weeks post-intervention were performed on all patients and included a visual analog scale for joint pain and swelling AS well AS data on morning stiffness, flexion, extension, knee circumference, likert scale of improvement, percentage of improvement, SF-36 generic quality of life questionnaire, stanford health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), lequesne index, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral corticosteroids, events and adverse effects, calls to the physician, and hospital visits. RESULTS: the sample was homogeneous at baseline, and there were no withdrawals. Improvement was observed in both groups in relation to T0, but no statistically significant differences between groups were observed regarding all variables at the time points studied. The sm/th group exhibited more adverse effects at T1 (p<0.05), but these were mild and transitory. No severe adverse effects were reported during follow-up. CONCLUSION: intra-articular injection of samarium(153)-particulate hydroxyapatite (15 mci) with 40 mg of triamcinolone hexacetonide is not superior to triamcinolone hexacetonide alone for the treatment of knee synovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis at 1 y of follow-up."

The study described is a newly launched cluster-randomized behavioral intervention to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the T2T approach in US rheumatology practices. It is designed to identify patient and provider barriers to implementing T2T management. This initial paper focuses on the novel study design and methods created to provide these insights.
METHODS/DESIGN: This trial cluster-randomizes rheumatology practices from the existing Corrona network of private and academic sites rather than patients within sites or individual investigators to provide either T2T or usual care (UC) for qualified patients who meet the 2010 revised American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and have moderate to high disease activity. Specific medication choices are left to the investigator and patient, rather than being specified in the protocol. Enrollment is expected to be completed by the end of 2013, with 30 practices randomized and enrolling a minimum of 530 patients. During the 12-month follow-up, visits are mandated as frequently as monthly in patients with active disease in the T2T group and every 3 months for the UC group. Safety data are collected at each visit. The coprimary endpoints include a comparison of the proportion of patients achieving low disease activity in the T2T and UC groups and assessment of the feasibility of implementing T2T in rheumatology practices, specifically assessment of the rates of treatment acceleration, frequency of visits, time to next visit conditional on disease activity, and probability of acceleration conditional on disease activity in the 2 groups.
DISCUSSION: This cluster-randomized behavioral intervention study will provide valuable insights on the outcomes and feasibility of employing a T2T treatment approach in clinical practice in the United States.

METHODS: Between 1994 and 1995 we recruited 80 patients for two double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials. All patients were treated for 2-30 months with a glycosylated fused protein consisting of two human p55 TNF receptors linked to a human IgG1-Fc. The dose range was 2.5-100 mg/month given i.v. with cumulative doses from 40-940 mg. All patients were followed-up prospectively for 24-36 months after initiation of therapy. The evaluations included a 48 swollen and tender joint count, ESR. CRP, RF, ANA, ENA, and safety parameters at 6 month intervals. In addition, pharmacokinetics, TNF, and anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection.
RESULTS: Data from 80 patients are available representing an experience of more than 170 patient years; 11 patients are still being treated. Predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol. Six patients died (1 during treatment, 5 in the post-treatment follow-up). All deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post-surgery septic arthritis 6 months after the last dosing (during vacation in another country). No malignancies were detected. Anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half-time. Shifts in the TNFR55-IgG1 glycosylation pattern affected pharmacokinetics and efficacy. A lupus nephritis occurred 18 months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive RA (ANA and dsDNS positive already before TNFR55-IgG1 initiation). Continued treatment for 3 years in 11 patients resulted in an 81% reduction in swollen joint count, less morning stiffness, less pain, and a reduction in steroids.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with TNFR55-IgG1 is safe and efficacious over the long-term in patients with severe refractory RA."
9258375,,10.1371/journal.pone.0112545,"A subset of patients with autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus appear to be exposed continually to interferon (IFN) as evidenced by elevated expression of IFN induced genes in blood cells. In lupus, detection of endogenous chromatin complexes by the innate sensing machinery is the suspected driver for the IFN, but the actual mechanisms remain unknown in all of these diseases. We investigated in two randomized clinical trials the effects on RA patients of baminercept, a lymphotoxin-beta receptor-immunoglobulin fusion protein that blocks the lymphotoxin-Œ±Œ≤/LIGHT axis. Administration of baminercept led to a reduced RNA IFN signature in the blood of patients with elevated baseline signatures. Both RA and SLE patients with a high IFN signature were lymphopenic and lymphocyte counts increased following baminercept treatment of RA patients. These data demonstrate a coupling between the lymphotoxin-LIGHT system and IFN production in rheumatoid arthritis. IFN induced retention of lymphocytes within lymphoid tissues is a likely component of the lymphopenia observed in many autoimmune diseases. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00664716."

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of pelubiprofen with those of celecoxib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: this was a 6-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase III, non-inferiority clinical trial. The primary end point was non-inferiority of pain decrease from baseline to week-6 AS determined using a 100 MM pain visual analog scale (VAS). Pelubiprofen was considered non-inferior to celecoxib if the lower limit of the 97.5% confidence interval for treatment difference  was more than -10 mm. The secondary end points were AS follows: non-inferiority of (1) reduction of korean health assessment questionnaire (KHAQ) score; (2) decreased duration of morning stiffness; and (3) decrease in the frequency and total dose of rescue drugs after 6 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: seventy-seven patients in the pelubiprofen group and 68 patients in the celecoxib group started the study medication. Pelubiprofen was non-inferior to celecoxib with regard to reduction in VAS pain severity (difference, mean ¬± SD 5.0 ¬± 20.1; 97.5% CI, -2.3 to ‚àû). Pelubiprofen was also non-inferior to celecoxib in terms of the secondary end points, such as, decrease in KHAQ score (0.0 ¬± 0.5, 97.5% CI -0.2 to ‚àû), decrease in duration of morning stiffness (median 0.0 minute in both groups), and decrease in the frequency (0.7 ¬± 3.5, 97.5% CI -0.6 to ‚àû) and total amount (0.7 ¬± 3.6, 97.5% CI -0.6 to ‚àû) of rescue medication uses during the 6 week study period. Safety analysis revealed 31.2% patients in the pelubiprofen group and 20.6% patients in the celecoxib group experienced an adverse drug reaction (ADR). The frequency of gastrointestinal adrs was 20.8 % and 8.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: pelubiprofen was found to BE AS effective AS celecoxib at pain reduction and for relieving stiffness in RA patients.

One hundred and sixty-nine patients, aged between 22 and 70 years, were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups; either aceclofenac 100 mg b.i.d. (87 patients) or ketoprofen 50 mg t.i.d. (82 patients). A placebo tablet was administered to aceclofenac-treated patients to maintain the double-blind conditions of the study. Patients were examined at 15 days and at 1, 2 and 3 months. Efficacy was assessed by the following clinical parameters: ritchie index, pain on a visual analogue scale, grip strength, morning stiffness, spontaneous morning pain, pain on movement and nocturnal pain, together with functional capacity. Efficacy was demonstrated for both drugs, with progressive improvement in the main clinical evaluation parameters until the end of the treatment period. This was particularly pronounced at 15 days in the aceclofenac group, with a rapid improvement in the Ritchie index (baseline vs 15 days: p < 0.001). Laboratory analyses performed were all within the normal range for both drugs. Eleven patients in the ketoprofen group abandoned the study because of inefficacy, whilst only 4 patients discontinued the treatment for this reason in the aceclofenac group. Eleven patients in the ketoprofen group and 2 patients in the aceclofenac group withdrew from the study because of adverse events. In summary, this study demonstrated that aceclofenac, a new NSAID, is effective in the symptomatic treatment of RA with a minor number of patient withdrawals because of inefficacy and a better safety profile than ketoprofen."

Methods: this was a pre-specified sub-group analysis of a multicenter open-label observational study of patients with RA according to 1987 ACR criteria who initiated RTX, ABA, or TCZ and were enrolled in 3 French Society of Rheumatology prospective registries (AIR for rituximab, ORA for abatacept, and REGATE for tocilizumab). We used a propensity-score approach to adjust for differences in observed factors that might affect both treatment assignment and outcome. Results: data on concomitant treatment were available in 4469 out of 4498 patients (99.6%). 34.9, 34.3 and 40.2% of patients respectively treated with ABA, RTX and TCZ, initiated their biologic in monotherapy. 79.5% of patients with a csDMARD received methotrexate. 3507 patients had a follow-up at 24 months for a total follow-up of 18898 patient-years (RTX: 10545; ABA: 4912; TCZ: 3441). - Effect of concomitant csDMARD on the effectiveness of each drug Drug retention without failure of RTX at 2 years was 67.8% in patients treated in combination with a csDMARD and 65.1 [61.5;68.8]% in monotherapy, HR of discontinuation 0.89 [0.76;1.05], p= 0.21. Drug retention without failure of RTX at 5 years was 50.1[47.4; 53.0]% in combination and 45.3 [41.5;49.4]% in monotherapy, HR of discontinuation of 0.88 [0.77;1.0], p= 0.08.

In addition, differences in socio-demographic and clinical characteristics between users and non-users were explored.
METHODS: as part of regular care the care booklet was distributed among RA-patients of two hospitals in the Netherlands. 1000 patients received the care booklet by mail, whereas another 1000 received an information letter with the option to order the care booklet. Four months after distribution, a random sample of 810 patients (stratified by hospital and distribution method) received a questionnaire on the use of the booklet, social-demographic and clinical characteristics. To compare effects between the two distribution strategies and differences between users and non-users univariate and multilevel regression analyses were performed. Secondary analysis included a per-protocol analysis (excluding participants who did not order the care booklet).
RESULTS: one hundred ninety four patients in the 'unsolicited supply' and 176 patients in the 'supply on demand' group (46%) returned the questionnaire. In the 'supply on demand' group 106 (60.2%) participants ordered the care booklet. In total, no difference was found in use between the 'unsolicited supply'-group (23.2%) and the 'supply on demand'-group (21.6%) (OR 0.9 CI: 0.6-1.5). However, the proportion of users among patients in the 'supply on demand'-group who ordered the booklet (35%) was significantly higher than in the 'unsolicited supply'-group (OR 1.9 CI: 1.1-3.2). Regardless of distribution method, use of the care booklet was associated with being married (OR 2.4 CI: 1.2-4.6), higher disease activity (mean difference 0.5 CI: 0.0-1.1), more activity limitations (mean difference 0.2 CI: 0.1-0.4), use of corticosteroids (OR 1.9 CI: 1.0-3.5), perception of disease course as fluctuating (mean difference 1.4 CI: 0.5-2.3) and higher educational needs (mean difference 9.7 CI: 2.9-16.6).
CONCLUSIONS: from an economic and environmental perspective a 'supply on demand'-distribution strategy could be recommended. Results of this study provide starting points to optimize further implementation strategies of a care-booklet in routine care.

Compared with non-treatment periods, indomethacin had a statistically significant therapeutic effect as judged by global assessment, duration of morning stiffness, use of escape analgesia, articular index and pain score, but there was no relation between the clinical effect and the size of the dose or the plasma concentration of the drug.

As a prelude to clinical trails, the safety and efficacy of haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilisation required investigation as colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) have been reported to flare RA. A double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled dose escalation study was performed. Two cohorts of eight patients fulfilling strict eligibility criteria for severe active RA (age median 40 years, range 24-60 years; median disease duration 10.5 years, range 2-18 years) received filgrastim (r-Hu-methionyl granulocyte(G)-CSF) at 5 and 10 microg/kg/day, randomised in a 5:3 ratio with placebo. Patients were unblinded on the fifth day of treatment and those randomised to filgrastim underwent cell harvesting (leukapheresis) daily until 2 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells (haemopoietic stem and progenitor cells) were obtained. Patients were assessed by clinical and laboratory parameters before, during and after filgrastim administration. RA flare was defined as an increase of 30% or more in two of the following parameters: tender joint count, swollen joint count or pain score. Efficacy was assessed by quantitation of CD34+ cells and CFU-GM. One patient in the 5 microg/kg/day group and two patients in the 10 microg/kg/day group fulfilled criteria for RA flare, although this did not preclude successful stem cell collection. Median changes in swollen and tender joint counts were not supportive of filgrastim consistently causing exacerbation of disease, but administration of filgrastim at 10 microg/kg/day was associated with rises in median C-reactive protein and median rheumatoid factor compared with placebo. Other adverse events were well recognised for filgrastim and included bone pain (80%) and increases in alkaline phosphatase (four-fold) and lactate dehydrogenase (two-fold). With respect to efficacy, filgrastim at 10 microg/kg/day was more efficient with all patients (n = 5) achieving target CD34+ cell counts with a single leukapheresis (median = 2.8, range = 2.3-4.8 x 10(6)/kg, median CFU-GM = 22.1, range = 4.2-102.9 x 10(4)/kg), whereas 1-3 leukaphereses were necessary to achieve the target yield using 5 microg/kg/day. We conclude that filgrastim may be administered to patients with severe active RA for effective stem cell mobilisation.

We have investigated patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis to determine how synovial fluid levels of PGE2 are affected by tiaprofenic acid or indomethacin medication. Ten patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis were studied, with 5 patients receiving tiaprofenic acid and 5 indomethacin for a 1-week period. Synovial fluid and serum samples were collected over an 8-hour period on days 1 and 8; these were then assayed for PGE2 and active drug concentrations. The concentration of PGE2 in the synovial fluid fell consistently as the concentration of each drug rose, and low levels of PGE2 persisted on continuation of the medication. Tiaprofenic acid appeared to cause a faster onset of inhibition of PGE2 synthesis than indomethacin."

Thirty-two patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were included in a 12-week double-blind, randomized study of dietary supplementation with n-3 fatty acids (3.6 g per day) or placebo. The cytokines were measured in plasma before and after treatment with fish oil or placebo. In general, cytokine values at the upper limits of the calculated normal areas were found. The Interleukin-1 beta concentration in plasma was reduced significantly after 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with fish oil (p < 0.03). No significant difference was observed in the placebo group. The tumour necrosis factor alpha activity in plasma did not change significantly (p = 0.167). No significant changes were observed in the degree of complement activation. The clinical status of the patients was improved in the fish oil group, but not in the placebo group, judged by Ritchie's articular index (p < 0.02). We conclude that dietary supplementation with n-3 fatty acids results in significantly reduced plasma IL-1 beta levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Even though the cytokine levels were low, the anti-inflammatory effect of n-3 fatty acids could in part be explained by their ability to decrease cytokine production."

The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups. The first group was not treated with corticosteroids, the second group was treated with 3 oral pulses of 100 mg prednisolone and the third group received 3 intravenous pulses of 1000 mg methylprednisolone (MP) on alternate days during one week. In both steroid treated groups the serum parathyroid hormone concentration tended to increase. In the MP treated group an increase in the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration after the first pulse was followed by a significant drop; this effect was also seen, but somewhat retarded and less distinct, in the orally treated group. In the MP treated group the urinary calcium excretion raised significantly 6 hrs after the first pulse and then dropped significantly. In all groups no changes were found in the serum calcium level and the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline. We conclude that, acute changes in calcium and bone metabolism occur during treatment with intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone and with oral pulses of prednisolone. These changes are small and reversible in a few days."

METHODS: totally 88 RA patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group  and the control group (41 cases, MTX + LEF therapy). All patients received 12-week treatment. Clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory tests [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), and c reactive protein (CRP)], and adverse reactions were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: the total effective rate was 91.5% (43/47 cases) in the treatment group, and the total effective rate was 75.6% (31/41 cases) in the control group. There was statistical difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). The morning stiffness, the rest pain, the number of tender joints, the number of swollen joints, tender joint index, swollen joint index, ESR, RF, and CRP were significantly improved in the two groups after treatment (P < 0.01). Besides, clinical symptoms and signs, ESR, RF, and CRP were more improved in the treatment group after treatment, when compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of teriparatide as a function of baseline fracture risk, assessed using the FRAX tool. Methods: There was no difference in fracture efficacy of 20 and 40 mg teriparatide daily, and so the two active groups were merged. Baseline clinical risk factors (age, BMI, prior fracture, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, smoking and maternal history of hip fracture) were entered into country-specific FRAX models to calculate the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures with or without inclusion of femoral neck BMD. The interaction between probability of a major osteoporotic fracture and treatment efficacy was examined by Poisson regression. Results: The 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures (with BMD) ranged from 2.2 to 67.2 %. Treatment with teriparatide was associated with a 37 % decrease in all nonvertebral fractures compared to placebo treatment (95 %CI: 10, 56 %). Amongst patients in whom fractures were characterised as low energy, the decrease in fracture risk was more marked (Relative risk reduction=56 %; 95 %CI: 24, 75 %). The risk of vertebral fractures decreased by 66 %; (95 %CI: 50, 77 %). There was no significant effect on hip fracture. Hazard ratios for the effect of teriparatide on the fracture outcome did not change significantly with increasing fracture probability (p=0.30). Similar results were noted for the interaction when FRAX probability was computed without inclusion of BMD. Findings were similar for the interaction between probability of hip fracture and treatment efficacy. Conclusion: Teriparatide significantly decreases the risk of nonvertebral and morphometric fractures in women by a similar extent, irrespective of baseline fracture probability."
9258463,,10.1370/afm.1684,"PURPOSE: consultations for forefoot pain are frequent in primary care, but scientific support of treatment options is scarce. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of podiatric treatment vs standardized advice on proper shoe characteristics and fit of shoes by means of an information leaflet for people aged 50 years and older with forefoot pain in primary care.
METHODS: in this randomized controlled trial, 205 participants aged 50 years and older with hindering nontraumatic forefoot pain have been recruited at their general practitioner's office. Exclusion criteria were treatment of forefoot problem of less than 6 months' duration before inclusion, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy or having pain considered not to be musculoskeletal (eg, warts). Participants received shoe advice by means of an information leaflet or podiatric care. Foot pain, foot-related dysfunction, general health, and social participation were assessed by means of questionnaires every 3 months for 1 year. Using multilevel analysis, we analyzed results at the level of (1) outcome measures, (2) the individual, and (3) the general practitioner.
RESULTS: no differences were found between the 2 treatment groups. Both intervention groups showed an improvement over time in foot pain and foot-related dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: this study found that shoe advice provided to patients consulting their general practitioner for forefoot pain and symptom relief resulted in outcomes similar to treatment outcomes in patients consulting a podiatrist. Based on these results, primary care physicians should be cautious when referring a patient to a podiatrist; instead, they should start by providing advice on proper characteristics and fit of shoes."

METHODS: In this 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled (up to Week 20) study (NCT00928512), patients responding inadequately to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) or biologics were randomized to receive monthly subcutaneous injections of secukinumab (25, 75, 150, or 300 mg), or placebo. The efficacy and safety results up to Week 20 have been reported previously. Here, efficacy results from Week 20 to 52 and safety results from Week 20 to 60 are presented.
RESULTS: Of 237 patients randomized, 174 (73.4%) completed the study. Patients with improved American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) C-reactive protein (CRP) responses at Week 16 sustained their responses through Week 52. In patients taking 150 mg of secukinumab, responses were improved through Week 52 (ACR50: Week 16 = 45%, Week 52 = 55%; DAS28-CRP ‚â§ 2.6: Week 16 = 25%, Week 52 = 40%). The rate of adverse events (AE) from weeks 20 to 60 was 64.8%, with most AE being mild to moderate in severity. The overall rate of infections was 31.9%, most being mild. The most predominant infection was nasopharyngitis, and was not associated with dose or concurrent neutropenia. Serious AE were reported in 21 patients (8.9%). There were 3 reports of malignancies (ovarian, lung, basal cell), and no deaths between weeks 20 and 60.
CONCLUSION: Patients with active RA who failed to respond to DMARD and other biologics showed an improvement after longterm treatment with 150 mg of secukinumab. The frequency of AE remained stable over time and secukinumab had a consistent safety profile over 60 weeks."

9258507,,10.2741/1354,"Basal serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and somatostatin concentration were measured by standard radioimmunoassay in patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology as well as in a group of age-matched normal subjects. RA patients exhibited significantly elevated (age, 45-55 yrs, p less than 0.05; 55 yrs and older, p less than 0.01) serum growth hormone levels compared to age-matched individuals from the control group. IGF-1 was unchanged. Serum somatostatin levels were reduced in RA patients between 45 and 55 yrs but reached a significant reduction (p less than 0.0001) in RA patients, 55 years and older compared to age-matched individuals from the control group. RA patients treated with prednisone did not exhibit changes in either growth hormone or IGF-1 levels compared to RA patients treated principally with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and methotrexate. These results indicated that symptomatic RA is associated with elevated serum growth hormone without concomitant changes in IGF-1 compared to individuals from the control group. Reduced somatostatin levels in older RA patients resulted in a skewed upward growth hormone to somatostatin ratio. We conclude that the serum growth hormone to somatostatin ratio may be a useful surrogate marker of disease activity in symptomatic RA."

Hands and feet are most commonly involved followed by the cervical spine. The spinal column consists of vertebrae stabilized by an intricate network of ligaments. Especially in the upper cervical spine, rheumatoid arthritis can cause degeneration of these ligaments, causing laxity, instability and subluxation of the vertebral bodies. Subsequent compression of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata can cause severe neurological deficits and even sudden death. Once neurological deficits occur, progression is inevitable although the rapidity of progression is highly variable. The first signs and symptoms are pain at the back of the head caused by compression of the major occipital nerve, followed by loss of strength of arms and legs. The severity of the subluxation can be observed with radiological investigations (MRI, CT) with a high sensitivity. The authors have sent a Delphi Questionnaire about the current treatment strategies of craniocervical involvement by rheumatoid arthritis to an international forum of expert rheumatologists and surgeons. The timing of surgery in patients with radiographic instability without evidence of neurological deficit is an area of considerable controversy. If signs and symptoms of myelopathy are present there is little chance of recovery to normal levels after surgery.
DESIGN: in this international multicenter randomized clinical trial, early surgical atlantoaxial fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and radiological abnormalities without neurological deficits will be compared with prolonged conservative treatment. The main research question is whether early surgery can prevent radiological and neurological progression. A cost-effectivity analysis will be performed. 250 patients are needed to answer the research question.
DISCUSSION: early surgery could prevent serious neurological deficits, but may have peri-operative morbidity and loss of rotation of the head and neck. The objective of this study is to identify the best timing of surgery for patients at risk for the development of neurological signs and symptoms."

Thirty patients with juvenile chronic arthritis were randomly allocated to receive a freeze-dried powder of Lactobacillus GG, or bovine colostrum, or bovine immune colostrum, for a two- week period. Immunologic and non-immunologic gut defence mechanisms were indirectly investigated in blood and faecal samples. In patients receiving Lactobacillus GG, the median (interquartile range) frequency of immunoglobulin-secreting cells, determined by enzyme-linked immunospot assay, increased in the IgA class from 1840 (690-2530) to 3480 (1030-13 170)/106 cells; p = 0.02. Likewise the median (interquartile range) frequency of specific antibody-secreting cells against dietary antigens increased during the Lactobacillus GG therapy in the IgM class from 3.8 (1.4-5.0) to 11.2 (5.0-30.0)/106 cells; p=0.02. In addition, Lactobacillus GG therapy decreased the median (interquartile range) activity of faecal urease, which has been associated with mucosal tissue damage, from 40.3 (21.7-54.3) to 28.6 (24.5-49.4) nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1; p = 0.10, while, in patients receiving bovine colostrum, faecal urease activity increased (from 42.2 to 80.6; p = 0.04). All findings were transient. We suggest that gut defence mechanisms are disturbed in juvenile chronic arthritis and we further suggest that orally administered Lactobacillus GG has a potential to reinforce the mucosal barrier mechanisms in juvenile chronic arthritis.

CPM resulted in a significant increase in both the early and late range of knee flexion. This increase occurred in both rheumatoid and osteoarthritic patients. The improvement of 10 degrees at 12 months allowed additional important function to be attained. CPM resulted in significantly earlier discharge from hospital. It did not increase the clinical incidence of wound healing problems, nor did it significantly increase the postoperative fixed flexion deformity or the extension lag.

In addition, risk factors were studied in order to help in targeting of such treatment to specific groups of patients.
DESIGN: Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised, parallel group with endoscopic assessments at 0, 4, and 8 weeks.
SETTING: Multicentre outpatient study at secondary referral centres in five European countries. PATIENTS--297 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis over the age of 18 without lesions in the stomach and duodenum at baseline endoscopy (after one week without taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Those taking other antirheumatic agents, concomitant ulcerogenic drugs, or treatment for peptic ulcers within the previous 30 days were excluded. Age, sex, arthritic disease, and type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used were comparable in the two treatment groups. In all, 263 patients completed the trial.
INTERVENTIONS: Ranitidine 150 mg twice daily or placebo (plus the selected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) was prescribed within five days after the baseline endoscopy for two consecutive periods of four weeks. Paracetamol was permitted during the study, but not antacids. Patients were withdrawn if the most severe grade of damage (including ulceration) was found at the four week endoscopy or when indicated, or with lesser damage at the investigator's discretion. END POINT: Frequency of gastric and duodenal ulceration or lesions, or both.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of peptic ulceration by eight weeks was 10.3% (27/263); 2 out of 135 (1.5%) developed duodenal ulceration in the ranitidine group, compared with 10 out of 126 (8%) taking placebo. The frequency of gastric ulceration was the same (6%) for the two groups at eight weeks. Though significantly fewer gastric lesions developed in the ranitidine group by eight weeks. The frequency of non-ulcerative lesions in the duodenum did not differ greatly for the two groups at either time point. Twelve out of 75 (16%) patients taking piroxicam developed peptic ulceration, of whom two thirds had duodenal ulceration. Patients with a history of peptic ulcer were particularly susceptible to recurrent ulceration, against which ranitidine offered some protection.
CONCLUSIONS: Ranitidine 150 mg twice daily significantly reduced the incidence of duodenal ulceration but not gastric ulceration when prescribed concomitantly with one of four commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."

Group 1 (n = 60) aimed to achieve SDAI <= 3.3 and Group 2 (n = 60), DAS28 < 2.6. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) were measured at baseline and 12 months. A posthoc analysis was also performed to ascertain whether achieving sustained remission could prevent progression in arterial stiffness. Results: the proportions of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy were significantly lower in Group 1 throughout the study period. At 12 months, the proportions of patients achieving DAS28 and SDAI remission, and the change in PWV and AIx, were comparable between the 2 groups. In view of the lack of differences between the 2 groups, a posthoc analysis was performed at Month 12, including all 110 patients with PWV, to elucidate the independent predictors associated with the change in PWV. Multivariate analysis revealed that achieving sustained DAS28 remission at months 6, 9, and 12 and a shorter disease duration were independent explanatory variables associated with less progression of PWV. Conclusion: with limited access to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, treatment efforts toward DAS28 and SDAI remission had similar effects in preventing the progression of arterial stiffness at 1 year. However, achieving sustained DAS28 remission was associated with a significantly greater improvement in PWV. Copyright ¬© 2018. All rights reserved"

A multiple time-series design varying the onset of the visual display was utilized. Compliance was assessed weekly over the 7 weeks of the study. Pretest and posttest measures of various indicators of hand functioning were taken by an occupational therapist. Visual display of the number of exercises completed decreased the number of noncompliant patients from six to two, with the maximum degree of noncompliance reduced from 44 to 5%. Thus the use of visual display is effective in producing compliance to exercise regimens. In light of the small sample size, however, no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of exercise on hand functioning."

METHODS: 40 Sj√∂gren's syndrome patients were divided in two groups and treated as follows: group 1 with hypotonic (150 mOsm/l) 0.4% hyaluronate eye drops; group 2 with isotonic 0.4% hyaluronate eye drops. The eye drops were instilled six times a day for 90 days. Grading of subjective symptoms, break up time (BUT), corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival rose bengal staining, Schirmer's I test, and conjunctival impression cytology were carried out at 0 and 15, 30, 90 days from the beginning of the study. Patients were examined in a blind fashion. For the statistical analysis the Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi(2) test were performed.
RESULTS: Symptoms were statistically significantly improved at day 15 in both groups but group 1 patients had a global score statistically significantly better group 2 (p=0.02). At day 15 group 1 patients had an improvement from baseline values of BUT (p=0.003), fluorescein, and rose bengal score (p=0.000001 and p=0.0004 respectively). Group 2 patients had, at day 15, an improvement of BUT and fluorescein score compared to baseline values (p=0.05 and p=0.0001 respectively). A comparison between the two groups showed better results for group 1 patients at day 15 for rose bengal stain (p=0.01) and for BUT (p=0.05) and fluorescein score (p=0.0003) at day 90. The conjunctival impression cytology showed that group 1 had a statistically significant better total score than group 2 starting from day 15 and lasting throughout the study (p<0.02). Also group 2 patients showed an improvement from baseline values starting from day 30 (p=0.000005).
CONCLUSION: Hyaluronate eye drops are useful for treating severe dry eye in Sj√∂gren's syndrome patients. The use of a formulation with pronounced hypotonicity showed better effects on corneoconjunctival epithelium than the isotonic solution."

METHODS: totally 167 RRA patients were assigned to the treatment group (73 cases) and the control group (94 cases) according to different therapeutic methods. Patients in the treatment group were treated with HTR combined MTX, while those in the control group were treated with leflunomide (LEF) combined MTX. Clinical signs and symptoms, RF, CRP, ESR, disease activity score 28 (DAS28), and safety indicators were compared between the two groups before treatment, at week 12 and 24 after treatment. The efficacy and safety indices were also evaluated. RESULTS: at week 12 after treatment the total effective rate was 82.2% (60/73 cases) in the treatment group and 79.8% (75/94 cases) in the control group, showing no statistical difference between the two groups (chi2 = 0.15, P > 0.05). At week 24 after treatment the total effective rate was 78.1% (57/73 cases) in the treatment group and 755% (71/94 cases) in the control group, showing no statistical difference between the two groups (chi2 = 0.15, P > 0.05). There was statistical difference in the total effective rate between week 24 and week 12 in the control group (chi2 = 0.49, P < 0.05). Clinical signs and symptoms, RF, CRP, ESR, and DAS28 were significantly improved in the two groups after 12- and 24-week treatment (P < 0.01).

A total of 109 adults (mean age, 65.2 years; range, 24-93 years) with musculoskeletal conditions were recruited across 18 australian community aquatic centers. The intervention is a peer-led, 45 min, weekly aquatic exercise class including aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance exercises (n = 67). The study also included a control group of people not participating in waves or other formal exercise (n = 42). Outcomes were measured using the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) and euroqol five dimensions survey (EQ-5D) at baseline and 12 weeks. Satisfaction with waves classes was also measured at 12 weeks. Eighty two participants (43 waves and 39 control) completed the study protocol and were included in the analysis. High levels of satisfaction with classes were reported by waves participants. Over 90 % of participants reported waves classes were enjoyable and would recommend classes to others. Waves participants demonstrated improvements in WOMAC and EQ-5D scores however between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. Peer-led aquatic exercise classes appear to improve pain, joint stiffness, physical function and quality of life for people with musculoskeletal conditions. The diverse study sample is likely to have limited the power to detect significant changes in outcomes. Larger studies with an adequate follow-up period are needed to confirm effects"
9258601,,10.1136/bmj.4.5884.82,"A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study is presented which assessed the comparative tolerance to, and efficacy of, a controlled release formulation of ketoprofen (Oruvail) and ibuprofen (Brufen) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteo-arthritis. A total of 44 patients were allocated at random to treatment with either controlled-release ketoprofen capsules 2 x 100 mg o.d. or ibuprofen tablets 400 mg t.i.d. for three weeks. After a one-week placebo wash-out period, each patient received the alternate treatment for a further three weeks. However, seven patients dropped out at Day 7 and hence were not analysed further. Adverse effects occurred in five patients receiving controlled-release ketoprofen and eight receiving ibuprofen. Epigastric pain was reported by three patients during each treatment regimen, including the wash-out period. Controlled-release ketoprofen was more effective than ibuprofen in reducing both pain severity and the duration of inactivity stiffness, and it appeared more beneficial in reducing severity of morning stiffness. The patients also considered controlled-release ketoprofen more effective than ibuprofen. It is concluded that controlled-release ketoprofen is more effective than ibuprofen in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteo-arthritis, although both drugs were equally well tolerated.

Respecting defined criteria 70 patients were put to couples according to a random list and were treated with gold or D-Pen. alternatively. Physical and laboratory indices of inflammatory activity were checked every 3 months, X-rays every 12 months. Dropouts (side effects, missing compliance, uneffectiveness) were replaced by the nextcoming fitting patient. Thirty-two of 147 totally recruited patients stopped treatment because of side effects, three because of unsatisfying efficiency. Forty-two patients shuned the necessary controls. The clinical course was better in 16 couples with gold, only in sex couples with D-Pen. Thirteen pairs showed no difference in this respect (p = 0.05). Looking to the laboratory parameters separately D-Pen. tends to be superior (p < 0.05), radiografic deterioration seems to be more seldom with gold (< 0.05). Side effects occur with both drugs in comparable frequency (15/44 with D-Pen., 17/52 with gold), but the complications with D-Pen. are more serious. Altogether this trial shows gold superior to D-Pen. in the long-term treatment of r.A."
9258609,,10.3899/jrheum.121465,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a proof-of-concept randomized trial of an Internal Family Systems (IFS) psychotherapeutic intervention on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity and psychological status.
METHODS: Patients with RA were randomized to either an IFS group for 9 months (n = 39) or an education (control) group (n = 40) that received mailed materials on RA symptoms and management. The groups were evaluated every 3 months until intervention end and 1 year later. Self-assessed joint pain (RA Disease Activity Index joint score), Short Form-12 physical function score, visual analog scale for overall pain and mental health status (Beck Depression Inventory, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory) were assessed. The 28-joint Disease Activity Score-C-reactive Protein 4 was determined by rheumatologists blinded to group assignment. Treatment effects were estimated by between-group differences, and mixed model repeated measures compared trends between study arms at 9 months and 1 year after intervention end.
RESULTS: Of 79 participants randomized, 68 completed the study assessments and 82% of the IFS group completed the protocol. Posttreatment improvements favoring the IFS group occurred in overall pain [mean treatment effects -14.9 (29.1 SD); p = 0.04], and physical function [14.6 (25.3); p = 0.04]. Posttreatment improvements were sustained 1 year later in self-assessed joint pain [-0.6 (1.1); p = 0.04], self-compassion [1.8 (2.8); p = 0.01], and depressive symptoms [-3.2 (5.0); p =0.01]. There were no sustained improvements in anxiety, self-efficacy, or disease activity.
CONCLUSION: An IFS-based intervention is feasible and acceptable to patients with RA and may complement medical management of the disease. Future efficacy trials are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00869349."
9258615,,10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011261,"Introduction: an increasing number of people are living with multimorbidity. The evidence base for how best to manage these patients is weak. Current clinical guidelines generally focus on single conditions, which may not reflect the needs of patients with multimorbidity. The aim of the 3D study is to develop, implement and evaluate an intervention to improve the management of patients with multimorbidity in general practice. Methods and analysis: this is a pragmatic two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial. 32 general practices around bristol, greater manchester and glasgow will BE randomised to receive either the '3D intervention' or usual care. 3D is a complex intervention including components affecting practice organisation, the conduct of patient reviews, integration with secondary care and measures to promote change in practice organisation. Changes include improving continuity of care and replacing reviews of each disease with patient-centred reviews with a focus on patients' quality of life, mental health and polypharmacy. We aim to recruit 1383 patients WHO have 3 or more chronic conditions. This provides 90% power at 5% significance level to detect an effect size of 0.27 sds in the primary outcome, which is health-related quality of life at 15 months using the EQ-5D-5L. Secondary outcome measures assess patient centredness, illness burden and treatment burden. The primary analysis will BE a multilevel regression model adjusted for baseline, stratification/ minimisation, clustering and important co-variables. Nested process evaluation will assess implementation, mechanisms of effectiveness and interaction of the intervention with local context. Economic analysis of cost-consequences and cost-effectiveness will BE based on quality-adjusted life years. Ethics and dissemination: this study has approval from south-west (frenchay) national health service (NHS) research ethics committee (14/SW/0011). Findings will BE disseminated via final report, peerreviewed publications and guidance to healthcare professionals, commissioners and policymakers.

Alfacalcidol (vitamin D analogue-1alphaD3) prevents bone loss and improves bone mineral density in glucocorticoid induced OP 1,2, also exerts anti-inflammatory activity. Objective: to assess changes in disease activity and bone turnover markers (BTMs) in active RA female patients, treated with high doses of alfacalcidol or prednisone. Material and methods: the study included 46 postmeno-pausal female RA patients with active disease (DAS28 3,2) on the stabile highest tolerable dose of methotrexate (MTX) therapy during three months prior inclusion. No one had OP or glucocorticoid (GC) treatment at the study entry. Five out of 46 pts have had low trauma fractures in the past. No other risk factors for OP, except RA, were recorded. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups during 3 months: 1alphaD3 1mug (11/46), 1alphaD3 2mug (12/46) and 1alphaD3 3mug (11/46) daily, or prednisone 20 mg daily, for the first month and 10 mg afterwards (12/46), in addition to MTX. Data collected were: disease activity (DAS 28 score), fasting serum levels of carboxyterminal telopeptide of collagen type I-sCTX and osteocalcin-OCN (ECLIA Roche diagnostics) at the baseline and at the end of treatment period. Results: patients age was 54,8+/-12,03 years, average disease duration 7,6+/-6,85 years and methotrexate dose 15 +/-3,31mg weekly. Average DAS28 was 5,29+/-0,914 and 25OHD3 level 30,18+/-12,468ng/ml. Baseline mean sCTX 780+/-402,7 pg/ml, OCN 19,1+/-8,78 ng/ml. After the end of treatment period, we found highly significantly reduced disease activity in all four treatment arms (p 0,01). Regardless of alfacalcidol dose, sCTX significantly decreased (mean change in all three treatment groups 32-40%, p 0,05) in contrast to prednisone use, where sCTX increased, while OCN decreased. Serum levels of 25(OH)D3 in prednisone users significantly de-creased (p 0,01). There was no alfacalcidol dose dependent difference in BTMs changes, nor sCTX, nor OCN. Urinary calcium increased significantly during treatment in 1alphaD users, but variations were within the reference ranges (0,16+/-0,069 vs. 0,26+/-0,150g/24h). Conclusions: three months of prednisone or high dose 1alphaD3 treatment in postmenopausal women with active RA, significantly reduced disease activity, while vitamin D analogue also significantly corrected bone metabolism, as by BTMs assessment, with acceptable safety profile"

METHOD: Patients fulfilling ophthalmological and haematological entry criteria were randomised to either 3 months of autologous serum 50% followed by 3 months of their conventional treatment, or 3 months of conventional treatment, followed by 3 months of autologous serum. Clinical assessments, including Schirmer's test, rose Bengal, and fluorescein staining, were carried out on entry and at monthly intervals. Impression cytology was performed at entry, 3 and 6 months. Grading was carried out on degrees of squamous metaplasia and goblet cell density. Subjective comfort was recorded daily using the ""faces"" scale. These categorical scores were converted to linear measurement using Rasch analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon's signed rank test and ANOVA.
RESULTS: 16 patients were recruited with 31 eyes studied. The ocular surface diseases chiefly included Sj√∂gren's syndrome (n = 6) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (n = 5). Impression cytology available in 25 of 31 eyes showed significant improvement on serum treatment, p<0.02. Rasch weighted faces scores were statistically significantly better with serum, p<0.01.
CONCLUSION: The results of this randomised study provide further evidence of the beneficial effects of autologous serum in severe ocular surface disorders. For most of these patients, autologous serum was superior to conventional treatment for improving ocular surface health and subjective comfort."

Current therapies are relatively effective and sometimes harmful. Royal Jelly with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties may be used as an adjunct therapy. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Royal Jelly on Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and morning stiffness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: According to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 classification criteria, 80 patients with RA, who had active disease (CDAI > 2.8), were randomly assigned to receive Royal Jelly or placebo beside background treatment for 3 months. Morning stiffness, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), evaluator global assessment (EGA) and patient's global assessment (PGA) [based on visual analogue scale (VAS)] were determined before and after 3 months of intervention. The changes in aforementioned indexes were analyzed by SPSS software. Findings: 65 patients completed the study (35 in Royal Jelly and 30 in placebo group). The sex, age, residence, disease duration and drug consumption had no significant changes (P > 0.050). In the first group, CDAI (P = 0.012), SJC (P = 0.024), TJC (P = 0.027), and morning stiffness (P = 0.004) had significant statistical changes; but only changes in morning stiffness were statistically different between the two groups (P < 0.05).

Seventy-two patients with highly active RA of > 3 years' duration were randomized to receive DFPP in addition to DMARDs (leflunomide and methotrexate) or DMARDs. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the right wrist was performed at months 0, 6, and 12. MRI bone erosion, synovitis, and bone edema were scored with validated methods. The primary endpoint was the change in MRI bone erosion over 12 months. Patients treated with DFPP in addition to DMARDs demonstrated significantly greater decrease in MRI erosion score compared with those treated with DMARDs, being 11.3 +/- 9.6 at month 12, compared with 16.9 +/- 8.3 in patients with DMARDs (P < 0.001), and compared with 14.4 +/- 9.6 at baseline (P < 0.001). 84.2% of patients treated with DFPP in addition to DMARDs demonstrated a decrease in MRI erosion score. Synovitis and bone edema improved significantly with DFPP in addition to DMARDs compared with DMARDs at months 6 and 12. (1.05 +/- 1.7 and 2.0 +/- 3.9 compared with 8.0 +/- 1.4 and 12.6 +/- 7.9 at month 12). Patients without synovitis and bone edema reached in 55.3% among patients with DFPP in addition to DMARDs. This study demonstrated that DFPP combination therapy significantly decreased bone erosion and received the primary goal of repair of erosions through abrogating MRI inflammation (synovitis and bone edema) in long-standing RA patients with high disease activity. The findings suggest that addition of DFPP is associated with repair of erosions and further suppression of inflammation.

In the first phase, the patients were given either 1,000 mg ibuprofen-lysinsalt or 50 mg diclofenac at 8.00 a.m. Pain intensity was assessed by the patient with the aid of the visual analog scale (VAS) and a sliding numerical scale. With respect to the rate of onset of the effect and the course of the pain, no statistically significant differences were seen between the two drugs. In a second phase, in which the already mentioned doses of the drugs were administered 3 times a day for 7 days, there was again no significant difference in pain. Drug tolerance was considered very good by 90% of the ibuprofen-lysinsalt group, and 67% of the diclofenac group. Ibuprofen-lysinsalt is a universal, well-tolerated analgetic which can also be used to combat arthritic pain.

Sulfasalazine has recently gained wide acceptance in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and beneficial effects have also been noted in ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis. We report a double blind placebo controlled study of sulfasalazine in PsA.
METHODS: Twenty-four patients with active PsA were randomized to receive either sulfasalazine (3 g/day) (n = 10) or placebo (n = 14) for 8 weeks, in a double blind manner, followed by an 8 week open label crossover phase for nonresponding placebo patients.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo controls, sulfasalazine treated patients were significantly improved at Weeks 4 and 8 with respect to physician (p < 0.01) and patient (p < 0.05) global assessments. Duration of morning stiffness was significantly decreased at Week 8 (p < 0.01). Clinical variables of disease activity returned to baseline after a 4 week drug washout period in 5 evaluable patients. Six patients in the placebo group crossed over to an 8 week open label phase and demonstrated significant improvements in joint scores, 50 ft walking time, and global patient assessment. Sulfasalazine treated patients also showed significant improvements in cutaneous involvement.
CONCLUSION: Sulfasalazine was effective in PsA, with efficacy observed as early as the 4th week of treatment. Longterm studies are needed to determine whether such therapy can modify disease outcome."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, terminal disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation, lung and systemic inflammation. To date, one randomized controlled trial has been published that assessed the efficacy of LCn-3PUFA in people with this condition. The aim of this article is to discuss the feasibility of conducting a trial to evaluate fish oil supplementation as adjunct therapy in people with COPD.
METHODS/DESIGN: a 16-week parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dietary supplementation trial will be evaluated. Forty participants meeting spirometric and clinical criteria for COPD will be recruited from metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. Participants will be randomized by minimization, based on a score derived from the modified Medical Research Council Scale for breathlessness, to receive 6 g/day of fish oil (approximately 3.6 g/day of LCn-3PUFA), or placebo (6 g/day of corn oil) capsules. Feasibility outcomes (recruitment, retention, supplement adherence, and time lost to exacerbation) and scientific outcomes (effect size and estimates of variance for inflammatory biomarkers, incorporation of LCn-3PUFA into erythrocytes, small airways function, dyspnea and functional exercise capacity) will be assessed pre- and post-intervention. Key feasibility criteria include recruitment of 40 participants in 52 weeks, 75% participant retention rate, 2% increase in the proportion of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in erythrocytes, and a positive moderate effect size in at least three efficacy measures.
DISCUSSION: there are a number of challenges in designing supplementation intervention studies with this population. These include the lack of prior data from which to select appropriate primary outcomes or to estimate effect sizes, and the feasibility of continuous supplementation in a population characterized by multiple comorbidities and a high likelihood of exacerbations, potentially requiring hospitalization or change in medication. Upon completion of this protocol, feasibility outcomes will guide the direction of future multicentre dietary interventions in this population.

This prospective quasi experimental study was designed to determine the potential beneficial effects of antioxidant intervention on clinical parameters for RA. Methods: a total of 124 patients with positive rheumatoid factor and Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) > 3.2 were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups randomly. Group A (n-63) received methotrexate with antioxidant vitamins (A, C and E in a fixed dose) and group B (n-61) methotrexate only. They were followed up for three visits (at week 0, 10th week and 14th week). The intervention with vitamins was stopped after 10 weeks and was followed up again after 4 weeks. Number of tender and swollen joints, visual analog scale (VAS), DAS-28 and laboratory parameters like Hb%, ESR, total count of WBC, CRP, RA titre, serum creatinine, and aminotransferase were assessed in each visit. Qualitative and quantitative variables were analyzed and evaluated by Chi-square and t-test respectively. P-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: number of tender and swollen joints was reduced and general health improved, as reflected by a significantly improved DAS-28 (P < 0.001) at 10th weeks in group A. At 14th week (3rd visit) there was no significant improvement of DAS 28 in group A in comparison to group B. Conclusion: this study documented the beneficial effects of antioxidants on RA, specially in developing countries with poor resource setting"
9258715,,10.1097/brs.0000000000001994,"Background: Traditionally, it has been common to apply external fixation using a collar after cervical laminoplasty for the purpose of resting the wound. However, some reports have been made claiming that use of a collar for a long period may induce such problems as muscle atrophy and joint contracture, and increase risks of malalignment and axial pain, and that, therefore, postoperative fixation may be omitted. However, these reports were all based on retrospective studies, and controversy remains as to the benefit of postoperative use of a collar. We investigated the effect of collar-aided fixation on prognosis following laminoplasty for cervical myelopathy in this randomized controlled study. Methods: This trial involved 90 patients (mean age, 72.7years; 62 males and 28 females) with cervical compressive myelopathy who had undergone double-door laminoplasty from June, 2009 to July, 2012. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, trauma or sever local kyphosis were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from each patient before research participation. Prior to their operations, we randomly assigned 45 patients to the collar-fixation (CF) group where each of them underwent external fixation using a Philadelphia collar for 2 weeks following their operations, and 45 to the no-collar (NC) group where they wore no collar (Figure). Finally, we successfully completed one-year follow-up for 74 patients (39 patients in the CF group and 35 patients in the NC group) and we assessed them using the JOA score, SF-36, a visual analog scale (VAS) of cervical pain, lordotic angle of C2 to 7, prior to the operations and one year after the operations, and perioperative complications (infection, epidural hematoma, C5 palsy). We used Student's t test and chi-squared test for statistical analysis and a P value of less than 0.05 considered to be significant. Results: JOA scores significantly improved in both groups (P = 0.002, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the recovery rate of JOA scores (P = 0.80). The loss of lordotic angle of the cervical spine after operation was 6.5degrees and 7.1degrees in the CF goup and the NC group, respectively (P = 0.82). VAS scores after operation were 2.9cm and 3.5cm, respectively (P = 0.68). SF-36 BP-domain was similar in both groups (P = 0.58). The Incidences of complication were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: Previous retrospective studies showed better cervical range of motion for nocollar or shortened collar term after laminoplasty. However, there was no randomized controlled study before. Here we showed that patients exhibited good neurological symptoms and recovery of ADL with or without collar fixation. Furthermore, there might be potential disadvantages for collar fixation such as higher cost or skin discomfort. Omitting collar-aided fixation was demonstrated to be a beneficial option after laminoplasty of cervical spine. [Image Presented]."

Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups to take atorvastatin or placebo 40 mg daily as an adjunct to current disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) treatment. Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), swollen joint count (SJC) & tender joint count (TJC) were assessed before and after three months intervention. // RESULTS: Analysis was based on intention to treat. DAS28 significantly declined in the atorvastatin group in comparison with placebo (p< 0.001). SJC, TJC, CRP and ESR also were significantly dropped in the atorvastatin group in comparison with placebo. // CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that atorvastatin can suppress RA activity and inflmmatory factors in RA patients for high to moderate grade of inflmmation."

However, 28¬†% of the 25 ASMP patients that attended four or more classes achieved ACR 20 after 18¬†months of follow-up, but only 5¬†% of the 27 ASMP patients that attended less than four classes achieved ACR20 (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.1). There was a reduction in the tender and swollen joints in both groups over time (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02), and those aged 60 and over had fewer joints involved. Half of the cohort fell at or below the poverty level. The percentages of patients achieving ACR20 were similar in the ASMP and usual care groups. Patients who attended four or more ASMP classes improved the most, but included only half of those assigned to ASMP. This suggests a need for innovative participant retention strategies or a different type of self-management program for this population."

An oscilloscope was employed to monitor the stimulator output in the TNS treatment groups and to provide strong suggestion and a focus of attention in the placebo treatment group. The two forms of TNS were applied at the highest intensity that could be tolerated by patients. Assessments of resting pain, joint tenderness, grip strength and grip pain were made before and after treatment. The pain and joint tenderness measurements showed high frequency TNS, ""acupuncture-like"" TNS and placebo TNS to be equally effective in producing analgesia of similar degree and trend over time. The grip strength measurements showed no significant change. The results obtained with placebo are probably due to the suggestion and attention effects of the visual stimulus. The implications of these results in respect to pain control pathways are discussed. Although TNS given at high intensity was shown to be no better than placebo applied with strong suggestion, this does not preclude its use as a method of pain control in rheumatoid arthritis."

Eight clinical assessments and 26 laboratory assessments were performed on each patient at each visit over a six month period. Results were analysed by conventional methods and also by correlation matrices constructed between clinical and laboratory variables. Patients treated with D-penicillamine (500 mg/day) responded adequately and the control group on aspirin (up to 3.6 g of enteric coated formulation/day) performed well, though the withdrawal rate from this latter group was high, predominantly because of continued disease activity. Patients receiving Clozic (100 mg/day or 300 mg/day) improved more than patients receiving penicillamine, particularly at the higher dose. Comparison of methods of analysis validates the use of correlation matrices both for detecting anti-rheumatoid activity and for determining the optimum dose of a novel compound. This trial illustrates the problems of a study of this nature, with the powerful effect on patients of being enrolled in such a closely monitored investigation.

Seven out of eight patients showed definite improvement in their clinical status as assessed by the Steinbrocker scale. Most of the symptoms, particularly pain, capsular swelling, tenderness and morning stiffness, were remarkably reduced within 3 weeks of thymopentin treatment.

The volume of SF was also calculated. Eight patients--4 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 2 with recurrent monoarthritis (RM) and 2 with osteoarthritis (OA) were randomly allocated to the treatment with intra-articular injection of Hyalgan (HA, Na-hyaluronate, 20 mg/2 ml), while eight patients having similar arthropathies--4 RA, 2 RM and 2 OA--were not treated (control group). In the patients treated with HA a significant reduction of SF volume (from 28.5 +/- 5.1 ml to 20.5 +/- 4.0 ml; p less than 0.02) and PGE2 (from 96.1 +/- 22.7 pg/ml to 66.2 +/- 14.5 pg/ml; p less than 0.05) was found, whereas cAMP concentration was significantly increased (from 4.5 +/- 0.7 pmol/ml to 7.2 +/- 1.2 pmol/ml; p less than 0.05). No significant variations were observed in the control group. Moreover, no differences in WBC count, TP and beta-2-m and CH50 were found in either group. These data could suggest an anti-inflammatory effect of HA that appears to be mediated by PG-inhibition as well as cAMP stimulation."

Overall, 95% (19/20) of subjects taking salsalate reported at least 1 adverse experience compared with 60% (12/20) of those taking naproxen (p = 0.02). This was due primarily to the higher number of subjects taking salsalate reporting reversible tinnitus or hearing loss. There was no significant treatment difference in adverse experiences reported for any other organ system. The results of our study support previous observations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis that salsalate produces less gastroduodenal mucosal toxicity than the widely used antiinflammatory agent, naproxen."

In final assessment of overall improvement, 57.9% of Auranofin-administered cases (22/38) showed moderate improvement or above. The comparable figure for GST group was 71.8% (28/39), but there was no statistically significant difference. Adverse reaction ADR incidence for Auranofin group was 12.2% (5/41), while 22.0% for GST (9/41), but the difference was not statistically significant. Drop out due to ADR was observed in 9.8% of Auranofin-administered cases and in 19.5% of GST-administered cases. The results of the study indicate that Auranofin is a most suitable DMARD than GST to be used for early RA, and GST is suitable for more active RA in view of its efficacy. But GST should be administered carefully because of its high ADR incidence."
9259145,,10.1136/bmj.301.6746.268,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether monthly treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone enhances or accelerates the effect of disease modifying drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
DESIGN: A 12 month double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial in which patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly allocated to receive pulses of either methylprednisolone or saline every four weeks for six months. At the start of the pulse treatment all patients were started on penicillamine or azathioprine.
SETTING: Four rheumatology departments in Denmark.
PATIENTS: 97 Patients (71 women, 26 men) aged 23-84 (mean 60) who had active rheumatoid arthritis of at least four weeks' duration despite treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monthly clinical recording of morning stiffness, number of tender and swollen joints, blinded observers' evaluation of therapeutic effect, and patients' self assessed condition. Concomitant laboratory measurements of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and concentrations of C reactive protein and haemoglobin. Radiography to determine the number of erosions at the start of treatment and after 12 months.
RESULTS: 57 Patients completed the trial, taking the same disease modifying drug throughout. Evaluation four weeks after each pulse treatment and at 12 month follow up showed no significant differences between the methylprednisolone and placebo groups in any of the clinical or laboratory variables. Radiography showed the same degree of progression of erosions in both groups. Evaluation of the total data on 97 patients and on the 57 who completed the trial showed the same lack of significance between the treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous pulse treatment with steroids can be recommended only for rapid temporary relief of flares of disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The response is short lived. Repeated pulses of methylprednisolone at four week intervals do not improve the results of treatment with drugs that induce remission such as penicillamine and azathioprine."

The purpose of these randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies was to compare etodolac with other standard NSAIDs or placebo for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Results of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis studies showed etodolac (200 to 300 mg b.i.d. or 200 mg t.i.d.) to be comparable to naproxen (500 mg b.i.d.), piroxicam (20 mg once daily), and diclofenac (50 mg t.i.d.). Key efficacy variables improved significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) in all treatment groups, and there were no significant between-group differences. Studies comparing etodolac (200 mg b.i.d.) with indomethacin (50 mg t.i.d.) for treatment of ankylosing spondylitis showed significant improvement from baseline in both the patient's and physician's global assessments for both treatments. Titrated-dose studies compared etodolac (50 to 200 mg b.i.d.) with naproxen (250 to 375 mg b.i.d.) and placebo for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. Both active drugs resulted in greater improvement than did placebo in the patient's and investigator's global assessments. These results indicate that etodolac is as effective as naproxen, piroxicam, and diclofenac for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Moreover, it is comparable to naproxen and indomethacin and superior to placebo for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis."

In parallel laboratory assays, Tenidap was found to exhibit a significant in vitro dose-dependent inhibition of ionophore-stimulated neutrophil production of the 5-lipoxygenase product: [3H]leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Although more importantly, Tenidap was also found to exhibit an in vitro dose-dependent inhibition (IC50 20 microM) of the ionophore-stimulated release (deacylation) of the precursor [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids. In further studies, Tenidap did not have any effect on fMLP-induced neutrophil chemotactic response. These results suggest that one of the possible mechanisms for the clinical effectiveness of this agent, may be through its effect at inhibiting the release of free AA from membrane phospholipids and therefore limiting its further metabolism into certain biologically-active inflammatory lipids."

Patients were endoscopically monitored at four, eight, and 12 weeks. Gastric ulcers at eight weeks had healed in 63% of those taking NSAIDs compared with 95% of those who had stopped NSAID treatment. For duodenal ulcer the healing rates at eight weeks were 84% in the group continuing NSAIDs compared with 100% in those who stopped NSAIDs. The differences in healing rates were statistically significant for both gastric ulcer (p = 0.001) and for duodenal ulcer (p = 0.006). At 12 weeks, 79% of gastric ulcers and 92% of duodenal ulcers were healed in the group continuing with NSAIDs. All patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers who stopped taking NSAIDs were healed at 12 weeks. The study shows that ranitidine 150 mg twice daily effectively heals NSAID associated peptic ulcers. Healing is more successful when NSAID treatment stops but even if these drugs are continued, substantial healing rates are achievable."

There were no intergroup differences with respect to sex, age, duration (median 2 years), stage and activity of the disease. In the case of ""striking improvement"" after 24 weeks a dose reduction to 50 mg GST/month or 4 mg AF/day was allowed and carried out in all GST patients and no AF patient. The serum gold levels were 5 times higher with weekly GST, they approached those of the AF group with monthly GST injections. The clinical parameters--number of swollen joints, activity index, articular index, grip strength, ESR--improved significantly in both groups, but grip strength, articular index and ESR improved more pronounced in the GST group. The X-ray progression (hands and forefeet) was significantly greater in the AF group. Forty-eight AF patients (80%) and 39 GST patients (36%) completed the first year. Thereafter the study was continued as an open study but the patients were allowed to switch from GST to AF. After the first and second year 14/7 GST patients switched to AF. The second/third year was completed by 37/22 AF pat. (62%/37%) and by 15/8 GST pat. (24%/13%). Skin reactions were more common with GST (41.9%/26.7%), diarrhoea was more common with AF (36.7%/19.4%), proteinuria occurred in 10% in both groups, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were rare in both groups (1.7%). The withdrawal rate due to adverse events was 10%/26% in the AF/GST group during the first year (p less than 0.05) and 25%/32% over the three year period (n.s.).

Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting occurred somewhat more frequently with diclofenac/misoprostol, but patient withdrawals due to adverse events did not differ markedly between the groups. Thus, in the short term treatment of acute tendinitis/bursitis of the shoulder diclofenac/misoprostol possesses efficacy similar to that with diclofenac alone and provides the gastroprotective benefit of misoprostol. Previous studies in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis have established diclofenac/misoprostol to be as effective as diclofenac but with significantly less gastrointestinal damage (Verdickt et al. 1992)."

The study included 40 patients, and it was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Misoprostol significantly reduced the gastroduodenal mucosal lesions found at endoscopy (P < 0.05) and prevented the development of ulcers. The cumulative incidence of ulcers at four weeks was 5% in the placebo group and 0% in the misoprostol group. The basal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid output as evaluated after 23 days of treatment with misoprostol was not significantly affected. Forty-one percent of the patients had signs of current Helicobacter pylori infection, 33% had positive serology only, and 26% had no evidence of infection. Most of the patients with current infection belonged to blood group O (P < 0.05). Misoprostol treatment did not affect the occurrence of Helicobacter pylori or the rheumatic disease activity. It is concluded that the protective actions of misoprostol on the gastroduodenal mucosa of NSAID-treated patients are largely mediated by mechanisms other than inhibition of acid secretion. The relationship among active Helicobacter pylori infection, blood group O, and peptic ulcer may be helpful to identify a subpopulation of patients taking NSAIDs at risk of developing peptic ulcers."

Patients were treated with either 400 mg or 600 mg etodolac SR once a day for up to 52 weeks. Withdrawals due to adverse reactions were low, occurring in only 5% (26/539) of all patients. The most common drug-related study events were GI-related, occurring in < 8% of patients. Elderly persons (> or = 65 years of age) were not at greater risk for adverse reactions or drug-related study events than were younger patients. Serious GI-related study events were rare (0.2%). The low level of serious GI effects was consistent with a separate study measuring gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss. Etodolac SR produced significantly less GI blood loss than naproxen in normal subjects. Because of its favorable safety profile, etodolac SR can serve as an alternative to conventional etodolac, providing the convenience of once-daily administration."

After operation the changes in bone density (by MD-method) and biochemical parameters were followed. In the non-treated group the serum level of [Ca] x [P] product temporarily decreased at 3 days after surgery. Average bone density at two months after the surgery was 8.8% lower than the preoperative value. In contrast, 1 alpha-OH-D3 treated group showed significantly less decrease of serum [Ca] x [P] product at the third day than the control group and no significant decrease of bone density at two months after the operation. From these results, it was concluded that the 1 alpha-OH-D3 suppresses the decrease of serum Ca and P level and systemic osteopenia after osteotomy and may have an beneficial effect on fracture healing."

The subjects in the vegan diet group received an uncooked vegan diet ('living food') for 3 months, and they were tutored daily by a living-food expert. The subjects in the control group continued their usual diets and received no tutoring. Adherence to the strict vegan diet was assessed on the basis of urinary sodium excretion and by the information on consumption of specific food items (wheatgrass juice and the rejuvelac drink). The use of these drinks was variable, and some boiled vegetables were consumed occasionally. However, only one of the subjects in the vegan diet group lacked a clear decrease in urinary sodium excretion. Rheumatoid patients had lower than recommended intakes of iron, zinc and niacin, and their energy intake was low compared to mean daily energy intake of the healthy Finnish females of the same age. Shifting to the uncooked vegan diet significantly increased the intakes of energy and many nutrients. In spite of the increased energy intake, the group on the vegan diet lost 9% of their body weight during the intervention period, indicating a low availability of energy from the vegan diet."

The disease sub-groups were divided into two arms, one of which was treated with DFZ and one with PDN in a double-blind protocol. The results of this study indicate that DFZ and PDN induced a clinical remission within 1 month which was maintained until the 6th month. Nevertheless, certain immunological modifications, including a significant reduction of the circulating T lymphocyte level and of the CD4/CD8 ratio, which was between 1 and 1,5 during the DFC treatment and between 1 and 2 during the PDN treatment, are more pronounced and more stable with DFZ than with PDN. Moreover, DFZ has a smaller effect on calcium and glucose metabolism than PDN since the serum glucose and calcium level of patients treated with PDN increased respectively from 90 up to 130 mg/dl and from 9,5 to 11,5 mg/dl whereas those of patients treated with DFC remained within the normal range.

Sixty patients (10 M + 50 F, mean age 56.6 yrs) suffering from local inflammatory processes in peri-articular/tendinous and/or extra-articular sites were involved in this study and randomly given either DHEP plaster or placebo plaster. Plasters were applied and left on the site of inflammation b.i.d. (at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.) for 14 days. Patients under stabilized systemic treatment with NSAIDs, glucocorticoids and/or basic therapy for over 2 months, maintained this treatment unchanged during the course of the study. Patients were examined on days 3, 5, 7 and 14. The effects of the treatments were assessed using subjective, semi-quantitative (provoked pain, peri-articular swelling, doctor-patient judgement, telethermographic index) and quantitative variables (spontaneous pain measured using a visual analogical scale). In the peri-articular pathologies, spontaneous and provoked pain decreased faster and in a clinically relevant manner in the group treated with DHEP plaster compared to the control group (p < 0.01). Local inflammation, objectively evaluated using the telethermographic index, showed consistent reduction during the study which was statistically significant from day 3 onwards and significantly different compared to the control group. Global assessment of efficacy, expressed by the investigator and the patients, was significantly better (good to excellent after only 7 days in 70% of the cases) in the DHEP group compared to the placebo group. In the extra-articular pathologies, results similar to those reported earlier were obtained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

METHODS: A 3-month prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study was performed using either 100 mg/day of bucillamine (Buc) or an inactive placebo (P1). Two groups of 12 patients each who had experienced an insufficient benefit from gold sodium thiomalate (GSTM) alone were enrolled in the study.
RESULTS: The addition of Buc proved more beneficial than P1 regarding improvement in disease activity (p = 0.0032) and drug usefulness (p = 0.0025). A significant within group improvement was observed in joint swelling count, the Lansbury activity index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. However, the difference in the clinical variables between the 2 groups was minimal.
CONCLUSION: The usefulness of ADT was suggested by this trial; however, further confirmation by additional studies is still needed."

Twelve females and 2 males with mean age, weight, and albumin concentrations of 58 years, 61 kg, and 40 g.L-1 respectively, completed the study. Comparisons were made between the following parameters: plasma piroxicam AUCs [AUC0-24(P)], plasma 5-hydroxypiroxicam AUCs [AUC0-24(5-OHP)], the ratio of these i.e. AUC0-24(5-OHP): aUC0-24(p), the % piroxicam daily dose excreted in urine as 5-hydroxypiroxicam (before and after glucuronidase incubation); and the mean of the steady state trough piroxicam, and 5-hydroxypiroxicam concentrations (obtained during each study phase in addition to the wash-out period). A statistically significant difference as a result of initiating either cimetidine or nizatidine was obtained only for the ratio AUC0-23(5-OHP): aUC0-24(P). This was indicative of a weak potential to inhibit piroxicam hydroxylation. No clinically significant alteration in the steady state pharmacokinetics of piroxicam occurred in these subjects as a result of cimetidine or nizatidine coadministration. Consequently it is unlikely that any adverse events would arise from these combinations."

METHODS: Fifty-two patients entered a randomized, double blind study. Patients were randomized to 3 months treatment with either nabumetone, 1000 mg nightly, or naproxen, 250 mg twice daily, followed by an endoscopist-blind 5-year followup study. After the double blind phase, 15 patients in the nabumetone group and 12 in the naproxen group continued in the longterm endoscopist-blind phase. Endoscopic evaluations for gastroduodenal damage and global assessments of arthritis activity and degree of pain for efficacy were measured.
RESULTS: Over the 5-year period, endoscopically visible gastroduodenal ulceration was found in 8 of the naproxen treated patients compared with one of the nabumetone treated patients (p = 0.02). There was a significant difference in the time to develop an ulcer, with a greater risk of developing an ulcer sooner while taking naproxen (p < 0.01). Patients in both groups reported significant improvements in arthritis symptoms (p < 0.01).

In addition, physicians documented patient improvement and side effects after 2 weeks and after 4 weeks of therapy; patients reported satisfaction with therapy and side effects on a weekly basis. A total of 399 physicians provided data on 1809 patients, of whom 84.3% had osteoarthritis, 12.6% had rheumatoid arthritis, and 3.2% had ankylosing spondylitis. The typical patient was a woman (64.9%), white (91.2%), in her 50s (mean age, 57.9 years), with a duration of osteoarthritis of at least 1 year (72.3%). High and similar compliance rates were achieved by patients regardless of age, gender, or diagnostic category. Patient and disease characteristics were similar between compliant and noncompliant patients. Most patients (81.1%) experienced improvement of symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment.

One hundred and eighty-five patients with active RA were enrolled into a prospective non-blind trial over 12 months and randomized to start at a dose of 15 mg/week with subsequent increases if necessary (group A) or 25 mg/week with subsequent dose reductions according to effect (group B). With 168 patients eligible for evaluation 74% of patient in group A and 73% of patients in group B were on MTX after 12 months. Withdrawal due to side-effects amounted to 16% of patients in group A and 18% in group B, and decreases in dose due to side-effects amounted to 10% in group A and 9% in group B. The higher dose of MTX elicited a significantly higher rate of gastrointestinal side-effects (28% versus 17%, P < 0.05) and a tendency towards a higher rate of liver enzyme elevations (47% versus 39%). The frequencies of other side-effects did not differ significantly between the groups. We concluded that starting MTX treatment at a dose of 25 mg/week was associated with a higher rate of minor but not major toxicity as compared with 15 mg/week. With this profile of tolerability it is possible to examine the therapeutic potential of MTX doses exceeding 15 mg/week."

METHODS: We investigated in a one-year double blind randomized study comparing intramuscular (im) gold with im methotrexate (MTX), whether the variation of inflammatory activity or functional capacity, the ascending anatomic stage, or DMARD treatments have an influence on bone formation (osteocalcin) in patients with RA.
RESULTS: Patients (n = 48) enrolled at the beginning of our study had significantly increased osteocalcin levels (3.45 +/- 0.93-->4.42 +/- 1.39 ng/ml p < 0.02) after one year if inflammatory activity decreased (> or = 1 SD: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 26.4 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) 3.8 mg/dl). We found a significant negative correlation of the one-year CRP- (r = -0.44, p < 0.001) or ESR differences (r = -0.45, p < 0.001) with the corresponding osteocalcin differences. This was also evident if these patients were pooled with 15 patients excluded from the double blind study as already receiving DMARD treatment (n = 63; p < 0.01). Patients with impaired functional capacity also had significantly reduced osteocalcin levels (p < 0.01). In both cases, alkaline phosphatase showed no significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that osteocalcin, a useful followup variable of bone turnover, is changed significantly (p < 0.02) in patients with RA regarding inflammatory activity and functional capacity. In contrast to alkaline phosphatase, a fall in inflammatory activity stimulated and impairment of functional capacity significantly decreased osteocalcin levels in patients with RA."

METHODS: Three hundred and seven patients were treated in a double blind, randomized multicenter study for 6 months. The first 4 weeks of treatment data were collected daily via patient operated computers in parallel with standard assessment at weekly visits to the clinics.
RESULTS: Daily patient data collection was more sensitive than weekly clinical assessments. Six months' compliance was 62% for tenoxicam and 67% for naproxen with comparable rates of withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse drug experiences in both groups. The spectra of adverse drug events found were very similar for both drugs but the rates were higher than in short term studies.
CONCLUSION: Daily computer data collection by patients is superior to classical clinical evaluation in drug studies. The longterm compliance of tenoxicam and naproxen are comparable when treating patients with RA."

Other studies have indicated that the inflammatory process in RA can be reduced through manipulation of dietary fatty acids. A switch to a vegetarian diet significantly alters the intake of fatty acids. Therefore, we have analysed the changes in fatty acid profiles of the plasma phospholipid fraction and related these changes to disease activity. The concentrations of the fatty acids 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-6 were significantly reduced after 3.5 months with a vegan diet (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01 respectively), but the concentration increased to baseline values with a lactovegetarian diet.

METHODS: We conducted an open prospective trial comparing daily and intermittent schedules. Among 76 Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 37 underwent daily treatment with D-Pen while 39 were given D-Pen intermittently (every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
RESULTS: The mean D-Pen dose was 166.8 and 99.4 mg/day for daily and intermittent groups, respectively, the difference being highly significant (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney's U test). The incidence of adverse effects was significantly lower in the intermittent group. Both schedules significantly reduced the activity of RA, as evaluated by clinical and laboratory variables.

Two hundred and twenty-five patients--one hundred with rheumatoid arthritis and one hundred and twenty five with osteoarthritis--were enrolled in a double-blind, randomised, controlled study versus piroxicam. Drugs were administered once-daily, for twelve weeks. The indices of efficacy (pain intensity, severity of inflammation, functional impairment evaluated at 0,2,4,8 and 12 weeks showed the good analgesic effect of piroxicam without significant differences between its two formulations. Tolerance appeared to be better in the group of patients treated with PBC than in the one treated with piroxicam. Both the incidence and severity of side effects were lower for patients treated with PBC. The majority of side effects were related to the gastrointestinal tract. The study suggests that PBC, used in the long term treatment of rheumatic diseases, improves the safety of piroxicam without affecting its efficacy. In another study, thirty patients with chronic osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to receive PBC or tenoxicam daily for eight weeks. Both drugs effectively reduced pain, inflammation, and functional limitation of the affected joints. Endoscopy revealed minor post-treatment mucosal lesions; these tended to be less severe with PBC than with tenoxicam. The clinical experience in the long-term treatment of rheumatic conditions indicates that the microencapsulation of piroxicam as piroxicam-beta-cyclodextrin has provided a new drug with a superior tolerability compared to the parent compound without affecting its high efficacy on the symptoms of the primary disease."

Droxicam was found to be statistically more active than indomethacin in alleviating morning stiffness and improving the functional status. The improvement of the variables induced by droxicam increased progressively throughout the study whereas that induced by indomethacin remained unchanged after the 2nd or 4th week of treatment. One patient treated with indomethacin withdrew from the study due to staggering and dizziness and several patients reported dyspepsia.

C. 0.2/day) with or without naproxen sodium (AP, Apranax, 2 x 0.550/day) in 30 patients suffering from gonarthritis, treated in 10 months in one of the three regimes: i--(n = 10, BMI-33.3, aged 59.5 y., Larsen gr. -2.5): 1st month-VR, 2 and 3-sCT, 4 and 5-VR, 6 and 7-AP, 8.9 and 10-VR; II--(n = 10, BMI-28.8, aged 56 y., Larsen gr. 2.95): 1st m.-VR, 2 and 3-Ap, 4 and 5-VR, 6 and 7-sCT, 9.9 and 10-VR; III--(n = 10, BMI-31.4, aged 58 y., Larsen gr.-2.8): 1st m.-VR, 2 and 3-sCT, 4 and 5-VR, 6 and 7-sCT, 8.9 and 10-VR. Clinical effects of treatment were evaluated by EULAR criteria, VAS, and the paracetamol consumption.
RESULTS: the best results according to all three criteria of improvement have been observed in group III treated only with sCT and VR followed by group I in which sCT was given as the first active drug. This effect lasted until three months after the withdrawal of sCT and/or naproxen. This results supported our opinion on antiosteoarthritic ability of salmon calcitonin and marked curative effect of flavonoides in the treatment of osteoarthritis."

METHODS: We used a multicentered, phase I/II blinded-withdrawal design with stratified entry. All patients began by receiving open infusions of IVIG at a dose between 1.5 and 2.0 g/kg/infusion (100 g maximum) bimonthly for the first 2 months, then monthly for up to 6 months. Beginning at Month 3, those who met the criteria for ""clinically important improvement"" were randomized to receive monthly infusions for 4 months of either placebo or IVIG in a double blind (DB) phase. Patients were permitted nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, slow acting antirheumatic drugs, and low dose (< 10 mg/day) prednisone at constant doses. An ""early escape"" provision in the DB allowed those who showed ""clinically important worsening"" to again receive IVIG (if taking placebo) or a higher dose of IVIG (if taking the lower dose of IVIG).
RESULTS: Efficacy. Twenty-five children entered the trial and 19 (76%) met the criteria for ""clinically important improvement"" during the open phase (OP) and entered the DB. Three patients completed the OP but failed to meet the criteria for response, and 3 patients dropped out of the OP, none of whom showed benefit from IVIG. Treatment effect sizes produced by IVIG were moderate to large for all variables in the OP. Patients who continued IVIG in the DB continued to show improvement over that achieved in the OP. Those given placebo showed a rapid loss of efficacy, suggesting IVIG has a limited duration of effect after discontinuation. Safety. No patient developed serious or unexpected adverse side effects in the open or DB phases, and none dropped out of the study due to toxicity or side effects.
CONCLUSION: Substantial clinical improvement from IVIG is produced in about three-fourths of patients with poly-JRA during open administration, but the duration of the beneficial effect is short after discontinuation. Those with disease < 3 years' duration may be more likely to respond than those who have had their disease for > 5 years. Short term safety is excellent."

The materials consisted of 58 patients with 75 surgically treated knees. Arthroscopic synovectomy was performed on 37 knees of 30 patients, who were followed for five years and four months on average. Open synovectomy was performed on 38 knees of 28 patients, who were followed for five years and five months on average. The results were evaluated for ; recurrence of synovitis ; duration of the symptom-free period ; progressive bone changes on radiography ; range of motion (ROM) ; duration of hospital stay ; duration of surgery. Due to the less invasive surgical procedure, arthroscopic synovectomy resulted in less post operative pain, and there was no restriction of ROM after surgery, no need for postoperative rehabilitation, shorter hospital stay, lower incidence of osteoarthritic changes, and earlier return to the daily life. However, as synovial membrane removal was unavoidably insufficient, the effect of surgery lasted for only 18 months on average and recurrence of synovitis was observed in 73 % of patients. Open synovectomy meant relatively greater invasion and postoperative pain. Due to the restricted ROM in some cases, postoperative treatment was required and the hospital stay tended to be prolonged. Nevertheless, the recurrence rate was only 37 % during follow-up and the effect of surgery persisted for an average of 75 months, much better than that of arthroscopic synovectomy. In the treatment of RA knees, the indications for arthroscopic and open synovectomies should be carefully studied in the light of the merits and for demerits of each procedure."

One hundred and eighty-five patients with rheumatoid arthritis were randomized to receive 15 mg or 25 mg MTX per week initially, and were followed over 30 months. Subsequent dose adjustments according to efficacy and tolerability resulted in levelling off of the mean dose at 18 mg/week, and the original treatment groups were combined for a longitudinal study comparing toxic events during months 1-12 and months 13-30. Withdrawals due to side-effects amounted to 17% during months 1-12 and 4% during months 13-30; dose reductions due to side-effects were 9% and 7%, respectively. The annual incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects increased from 26% to 39% (P = 0.05), that of liver enzyme elevation dropped from 43% to 10% (P < 0.001) and haemocytopenia remained stable at 5% and 7%. MTX pneumonitis was only observed during the first year, while airway complaints without evidence of parenchymal lung involvement increased to 10% beyond the first year. Fifty-six patients experienced 65 major infectious episodes over the 30-month period, with the respiratory tract being the most frequent site. This study showed that MTX treatment at doses exceeding 15 mg/week is tolerated over extended period of time. Major toxicity and withdrawals due to side-effects occurred predominantly during the first year of treatment and thus showed a decreasing trend over time, while minor toxic events continued throughout the study with a progressive rate of mucous membrane toxicity. MTX-treated RA appears to be a risk situation for major infection."

Treatment with aceclofenac was effective in improving the Ritchie articular index (predetermined primary end point), duration of morning stiffness, joint swelling, ARA functional class, patient's and physician's global assessments, and pain. All these improved to a significantly (P < 0.05) greater extent than in placebo-treated patients. Grip strength showed a significant improvement from baseline in the aceclofenac-treated group and this was greater than the improvement measured in placebo treated patients. No significant difference was detected between the treatment groups for the number of subjects reporting an adverse event. Aceclofenac administered orally at 100 mg twice daily for four weeks thus produced significant improvements in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. This treatment was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo."

This was followed by an open-label study to evaluate the safety of naprelan 1,000 mg once daily for an additional 9 months. In the double-blind phase of this study, the safety and efficacy of Naprelan 1,000 mg once daily were compared with those of Naprosyn 500 mg twice daily and placebo in 348 patients with RA. At the end of 12 weeks of treatment, Naprelan and Naprosyn were numerically superior to placebo in 3 of the 4 primary efficacy variables--physician's global assessment, patient's global assessment, and number of painful joints. Differences between Naprelan and placebo reached statistical significance for the patient's global assessment at Week 12 (Visit 7). Significantly more Naprosyn- than placebo-treated patients had at least 1 severe digestive system adverse event (AE); 1 drug-related AE; or 1 drug-related, digestive-system AE. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of AEs experienced by Naprelan-treated patients compared with those who received placebo. A total of 240 patients enrolled in the Naprelan open-label phase. As would be expected, patients initially treated with placebo showed significant improvement after starting Naprelan. Those initially receiving Naprelan or Naprosyn also maintained their improvement. The AE profile with Naprelan was similar to that reported in the double-blind phase. It was concluded that Naprelan 1,000 mg once daily was as effective as Naprosyn 500 mg BID in the treatment of RA and was particularly effective in relieving pain later in the day. The controlled-release formulation may also offer safety benefits."

Patients with PUD received open label ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. and the patients without PUD were randomly allocated to receive ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 4 weeks. PUD was found in 36 (26%) consecutive patients who presented with dyspeptic symptoms.

After 8 weeks of treatment PUD was healed in 27 (87%) patients. Of the remaining patients without PUD dyspeptic symptoms had disappeared in 24 (26%) of the ranitidine-treated patients which was significantly better (p < 0.02) than the 5 (6%) placebo-treated patients. The minor mucosal lesions found in this patient group improved to a similar extent in the ranitidine and placebo-treated patients although 1 placebo-treated patient deteriorated and 2 placebo-treated patients developed PUD during the 4 weeks of study.

METHODS: Four dose groups were evaluated with 4 patients with RA per group: 3 received active drug and one received placebo injection. After each dose group completed 4 weeks of treatment, the patient who received placebo was allowed to receive the active drug for one month. After these 16 patients completed the study, 3 additional patients received the highest dose and 3 additional patients received the lowest dose in an open label study to obtain more safety data (total of 22 patients treated).
RESULTS: There were no serious adverse effects. Drug related events include mild injection site reactions in 4 patients that did not necessitate discontinuation of the drug. There was no clearcut dose response among the treatment groups. At Week 4, there was 45% mean improvement in total pain and total joint scores in patients receiving active drug (n = 12), compared to 22% mean improvement in patients receiving placebo (n = 4). C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased substantially in patients treated with drug compared to placebo, 30 vs 13%, respectively. The decrease in CRP was most pronounced in the highest dose group.

METHODS: One hundred seven patients with arthritis (M/F 18/89, mean age 55.2 +/- 9.7 yr) enrolled in two centers were considered eligible for the study if initial endoscopy showed the absence of any relevant mucosal damage. Patients were randomly allocated to receive diclofenac 200 mg/day or naproxen 1 g/day plus either sucralfate gel 1 g b.i.d. (N = 53) or identical placebo (N = 54) for 14 days in a randomized double-blind study. Repeated assessment of GI symptoms and endoscopy were performed at the end of the study period.
RESULTS: At final endoscopy the incidence of erosion and the mean endoscopic score for both stomach and duodenum were significantly lower in the sucralfate gel group compared with placebo group (p < 0.05). Both heartburn and epigastric pain were significantly less frequent in patients receiving sucralfate gel than placebo (51 vs 30% and 49 vs 28% for heartburn and epigastric pain, respectively, p < 0.05). No differences were observed in the incidence or in the mean score for nausea. An unexplained difference in the incidence of ulcers was found between the two centers, but in both a similar reduction in the incidence of ulcers was observed between patients receiving sucralfate gel compared with those receiving placebo. The overall difference (8% in sucralfate-treated patients, 28% in patients receiving placebo) of gastroduodenal ulcers was statistically significant (p < 0.05).

For this purpose, one hundred and one unselected consecutive patients with RA and 70 age and sex matched controls were studied prospectively. Evaluation included a complete history and physical examination with special attention to symptoms suggestive of thyroid pathology, routine laboratory and serologic immune profile, plus determination of serum levels of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (AbTPO) and TSH receptor antibodies (TRAB). Serum thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) was measured in all subjects with high thyroid hormone levels, whereas free T3 and T4 concentrations were determined in all individuals with abnormal T3, T4, TSH or TBG. Six patients with hyperhyroidism, 3 with hypothyroidism and 1 with the euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia (EH) syndrome were found, whereas four of the controls had hyperthyroidism. Thirteen patients and 6 controls had high AbTPO levels whereas no one had high TRAB. No association was detected between thyroid abnormalities and any serologic RA finding. Furthermore, no correlation between thyroid dysfunction and elevated AbTPO's was found. A relatively high prevalence of thyroid dysfunction (9,9%) and subclinical autoimmune thyroiditis (12,9%), the latter indicated by elevated AbTPO's, was found in our RA patients. These figures were higher than those in the control group (5,7% and 8,6% respectively), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Of further interest may be our finding that, despite anecdotal reports blaming D-penicillamine for cases of autoimmune thyroiditis, the incidence of the latter was similar among recipients and nonrecipients of the drug.

The basic clinical pharmacokinetics of meloxicam (7.5-30 mg) have been investigated in 78 healthy male volunteers after single and multiple dosing via oral, intravenous and rectal routes. Plasma concentrations of meloxicam were determined by validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. The pharmaco-kinetic profile of meloxicam is characterized by almost complete absorption over a prolonged phase-avoiding high initial drug concentrations- and is bound to plasma proteins by more than 99.5%. Meloxicam is metabolized to four biologically inactive metabolites and excreted in urine and faeces with an elimination half-life (t1/2) of around 20 h. This is reflected in a total plasma clearance of 7 to 8 ml/min. Steady state is achieved within 3 to 5 days. In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters are linear over the entire dose range, there are no changes with multiple dosing and bioequivalence was shown for a number of different formulations. The results indicate that meloxicam is suitable for once-daily administration and that a switch from one formulation to another is easily possible if necessary or convenient for the patient."

Dynamic MR imaging was performed on 64 joints in a total of 18 patients before and after infusion with either a placebo or 1 or 10 mg/kg of anti-TNF-alpha moab. Additionally, treating the placebo group and reinfusing the verum group with either 3 or 10 mg/kg was monitored by quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Time-dependent signal intensity changes were then correlated with a total of five Paulus criteria and with ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP). No changes in either the gadolinium uptake or clinical parameters were seen after the infusion of a placebo. Therapy with 1 mg/kg anti-TNF-alpha moab resulted in a significant decrease in clinical disease activity, as well as in gadolinium-DTPA uptake in dynamic NMR studies. However, correlations between singal intensity changes and Paulus criteria were only demonstrated for the variable ""doctor's evaluation of disease activity"". Patients given 10 mg/kg moab demonstrated a very significant improvement in all clinical manifestations of their disease, as well as a high significant reduction in gadolinium uptake (P = 0.004). In addition, the latter group showed significant correlations between time-dependent signal intensity changes and five Paulus criteria: ""number of swollen joints"", ""number of painful joints"", ""duration of morning stiffness"", ""doctor's evaluation of disease activity"" and ""patient's evaluation of disease activity"".

MATERIALS AND METHODS: pairs of hand and wrist radiographs from 30 patients treated with MTX and 30 treated with D-penicillamine (DP) were evaluated blindly and separately by two radiologists (A and B) using reference radiographs for scoring. A scale scoring similar to Larsen's standard radiographs with minor modifications was used. The radiographs studied were obtained at the beginning and 5 years after therapy in both groups.
RESULTS: a significantly greater worsening was found in the DP-treated patients (p = 0.025), as compared to MTX patients. Methotrexate showed a slower rate of disease progression than DP. Furthermore, in the MTX group 15 patients remained radiographically stable, 9 worsened and 6 were healed. In contrast, in the DP group 22 patients remained radiographically stable, 8 worsened and none improved.
CONCLUSIONS: the rate of radiographic progression in RA patients was lower in MTX-treated patients compared to those treated with DP. Six patients showed radiological improvement after MTX treatment. Therefore, it seems that MTX could be considered a disease modifying drug."

The control group constituted 24 healthy subjects (group A). A Stoke index (SI) of DA was assigned to each patient. Patients were divided into two groups: c, minimal-mild DA (SI 1-7); D, moderate-severe DA (SI 8-17). Fibrinogen was elevated in RA correlating positively with SI and CRP. Hypercoagulability counteracted by reactive fibrinolysis was inferred from a 10-fold increase of DD in group B as compared to group A. The relatively lower levels of DD in group D compared to group C and their negative correlation with SI (r(s) = -0.49, p = 0.0006) indicate the tendency of fibrinolysis to decrease with the increase of DA. Significant elevation of t-PA and PAI-1 were found in group B compared to group A. While t-PA progressively decreased with the increase of DA (r(s) = -0.45, p = 0.0019), a positive relation of PAI-1 to DA was observed (r = 0.42, p = 0.0042). A 2-fold increase of PAI-1/t-PA molar ratio in group D compared to groups A and C as well as its positive correlation with SI (r(s) = 0.63, p = 0.0001) indicate the displacement of balance between t-PA and PAI-1 in favour of the inhibitor with the increase of DA in RA. The involvement of inflammatory mediators in PAI-1/t-PA imbalance was proposed from the relation of fibrinolytic abnormalities with the activity of systemic inflammatory process."

To evaluate the potential role of the P450IID6 phenotype in the pathogenesis of these adverse drug reactions.
METHODS: thirty-five patients with fibromyalgia were assessed using a structured questionnaire with demographic and clinical data and perceived adverse drug reactions. A sample of 60 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 62 patients with localized back pain served as controls. The P450IID6 phenotype was determined for each of the fibromyalgia patients.
RESULTS: overall, 141 patients had used NSAID and 79 (56%) of them reported adverse effects. Antidepressant drugs were used by 68 patients and 35 (51%) patients had adverse effects. Muscle relaxant drugs were used by 48 patients and 15 (31%) of them reported side effects. Analgesics were used by 122 patients and 22 (18%) had experienced adverse effects. Statistical differences in the frequency of adverse effects were found with antidepressant drugs in the fibromyalgia group, compared with rheumatoid arthritis (p=0.01) and back pain (p=0.02). Four of the 35 patients (11.4%) had a metabolic ratio (M.R.) greater than 0.30 (log M.R.= -0.52) indicative of the poor metabolizers (PM) phenotype. M.R. varied from 0.005 (log M.R. = -2.30) to 4.99 (log M.R. = 0.70).
CONCLUSIONS: the problem of adverse drug reactions in fibromyalgia patients does not appear to correlate with the PM phenotype of the P450IID6 oxidative enzyme. It also is unlikely that altered xenobiotic detoxification attributable to this PM phenotype would have a significant role in the development of fibromyalgia."

Bucillamine was at least as effective ad D-penicillamine in terms of improvement in the swollen joint count, tenderness score, morning stiffness, modified health assessment questionnaire, and Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and more effective in terms of improvement in the tender joint count, grip strength, C-reactive protein (CRP), and rheumatoid factor (RF) titer. In all, 27% of the bucillamine group and 33% of the D-penicillamine group responded; the response rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. The frequency of side effects tended to be lower in the bucillamine group. In conclusion, bucillamine was as effective as D-penicillamine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and with the former the frequency of side effects tended to be lower."

Forty-four women with a mean disease duration of 17.5 years had been treated with low-dose glucocorticoid (prednisone at < 5 mg/day) for at least 12 months. They were studied for an average period of 3 years and 8 months. The remaining 34 women had been treated only with nonsteroidal anti-rheumatic drugs (NSAIDs) and served as the control group. Bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine (L2-4) and femoral neck was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Reduction of BMD in the lumbar spine was significant in both groups (P < 0.05 to approximately 0.01), but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. BMD of the femoral neck decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the prednisone group, but again the difference was not significant between the two groups. Our data suggest that low-dose prednisone administration probably does not induce significant axial bone loss in female RA patients."

METHODS: In this double blind, multicenter, parallel group study, 51 patients receiving stable conventional CyA maintenance treatment were randomized to continue conventional CyA (n = 27) or to convert to CyA microemulsion (n = 24) and were monitored for 52 weeks. Trough blood CyA levels were measured before and at intervals after conversion. CyA steady-state area under the curve was assessed one week before and 2 and 6 weeks after randomization in 15 patients in each treatment arm. CyA trough levels and pharmacokinetic results remained unknown to investigators throughout the study. CyA doses were titrated as necessary on the basis of clinical evaluation and disease activity assessments.
RESULTS: Initial mean daily doses were 3.5 mg/kg/day (conventional CyA) and 3.3 mg/kg/day (CyA microemulsion) and did not change significantly during the study. The mean bioavailability of CyA from the microemulsion formulation was 23% higher than from conventional CyA. Replicate assessments indicated a more reproducible pharmacokinetic profile with CyA microemulsion. The overall incidence and nature of adverse events and changes in vital signs and laboratory variables were similar in both groups. No clinically relevant differences in efficacy were found between treatments. No loss of efficacy and no tolerability problems occurred after conversion from conventional to microemulsion CyA.
CONCLUSION: Existing CyA dosing guidelines, formulated for conventional CyA, are suitable for longterm CyA microemulsion therapy of patients with RA. These results indicate the pharmacokinetic advantages of the microemulsion formulation."

A total of 40 patients entered and 36 patients fulfilled the study, among them 16 started with the active drug and 20 with a placebo. Disease activity score (DAS) was used as the primary outcome measure with several secondary outcome variables. Type I or alpha error of 0.05 was accepted and the power (= 1-beta) was set to 80%, which according to the power analysis was also achieved. With active drug treatment, joint swelling score (54 count; P < 0.001), Ritchie's index (P < 0.01) and DAS (P < 0.001) improved. HAQ also improved (P < 0.05), but there was no improvement in the subjective condition of the patients as measured with the self-reported Pain Disability Index and Comprehensible Psychopathological Rating scale questionnaires. Apparently, 5/36 patients had a response of > or = 1.2 in DAS and 33/36 changed for the better; DAS impaired only in 3/36 patients during the active drug treatment When the stringent EU response criteria were applied and the results were compared to the placebo group, the response was not clinically significant. We conclude that Gly-X-Y repeat sequences are not effective as used in the present study. However, this does not definitely disprove the value of the Gly-X-Y repeat sequences, because confounding effects of dosage, concomitant medication and excessive degradation of the linear Gly-X-Y sequences in the stomach, gut or by phagolysosomes could not be adequately controlled. The discrepancy between the favourable effects in the preliminary, open pilot study and the controlled clinical trial emphasizes the value of the DAS, EU response criteria and adequately administered controlled clinical studies."

Salivary IL-6 levels were significantly elevated (P < 0.01) in the 36 patients with SS as compared to the 19 patients with dry mouth (200.5 +/- 43.6 and 12.6 +/- 6.8 pg/ml, respectively). No significant differences were noted in the serum IL-6 levels between these two groups (105.8 +/- 17.1 and 84.8 +/- 17.1 pg/ml, respectively). Both salivary and serum IL-6 levels in the normal controls were below the level of detection of the assay. Positive correlation (r = 0.8613, P < 0.0001) was found between salivary IL-6 levels and the focus score of labial biopsies in SS patients. Elevated salivary IL-6 levels appear to be a consequence of local production and may reflect the component of salivary gland inflammation in SS."

This study was an adjunct to a clinical trial that investigated the safety and the efficacy of Depo-Medrone during the induction phase of gold therapy. The NAG activities and albumin levels in the urine of 36 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis treated with sodium aurothiomalate weekly up to a total of 1 g were investigated. NAG was assayed in 565 early morning urine samples of these patients at weekly intervals for 24 weeks. The mean NAG level rose from 50.2 nmol/mg of creatinine on entry to peak NAG excretion of 120.4 nmol/mg of creatinine at week 4 and then fell to 56.3 nmol/mg of creatinine at week 24. Urinary albumin was assayed in 252 early morning urine samples at monthly intervals during gold treatment. Values greater than 20 mg/l were observed in 7.5% of urine samples. Microalbuminuria was present in 9% of patients at baseline. Two patients who were withdrawn because of proteinuria and macroalbuminuria had normoalbuminuria on entry. We conclude that raised levels of NAG associated with tubular damage are more frequent than glomerular damage on entry to, and during, treatment with gold salts."

Patients with sarcoidosis had mainly pulmonary (P < 0.001) and skin involvement (P < 0.05), while SS patients presented more frequently with Raynaud's phenomenon (P < 0.05).

Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), which was performed in 10 sarcoidosis patients, revealed the presence of NCG in all patients. In patients with sarcoidosis and sicca symptoms as the presenting syndrome, PGE is a useful clinical finding. Searching for pulmonary involvement is a determining factor to differentiate sarcoidosis from SS. The absence of autoantibodies is another useful tool for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Finally, MSGB is very helpful to discriminate between sarcoidosis and SS and when MSGB is not specific, then TBLB is valuable to confirm the diagnosis."

Utilities represent a generic and comprehensive quality of life measure, capable of integrating domain-specific information into one overall value which a patient assigns to his state of health. Therefore, the effect of r-hu-Epo on quality of life was studied by measuring utilities, derived from the rating scale and standard gamble, in a 52-week placebo-controlled randomised double-blind study with r-hu-Epo in 70 patients with active RA and ACD. Furthermore, the relation between anaemia as assessed by haemoglobin levels (Hb), disease activity as assessed with the Disease Activity Score (DAS), and utilities was investigated. Compared to the placebo group, significant improvement of Hb (P < 0.001), DAS (P = 0.01) and rating scale utilities (P = 0.002), but not of standard gamble utilities, was observed in the Epo group. Rating scale utilities correlated strongly with DAS (r = -0.47, P < 0.01), Hb (r = 0.37, P < 0.01) and changes in both DAS (r = -0.74, P < 0.01) and Hb (r = 0.44, P < 0.01). Both DAS and Hb contributed significantly to the variance in rating scale utilities (21% and 3% respectively) and to changes in rating scale utilities (43% and 3% respectively). Standard gamble utilities correlated less well with clinical disease variables than rating scale utilities did. These results indicate, that r-hu-Epo improves utility-derived health-related quality of life, most probably by improving both disease activity and anaemia. Utilities, particularly rating scale utilities, correlated well with conventional disease activity variables and proved sensitive to change. Utilities may be a useful tool for investigating quality of life in RA-patients."

METHODS: Duodenal biopsies from 25 patients with RA were obtained by endoscopy. Single cell suspensions from the epithelial layer and lamina propria were prepared. Flow cytometry was used to examine the expression of CD4, CD8, T cell receptor-gammadelta (TCR-gammadelta), TCR-alphabeta, HLA-DR, CD44, and interleukin 2 receptor on gut T lymphocytes. Fifteen disease control (DC) individuals and 6 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) taking longterm nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy were also investigated. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from all individuals were examined for the expression of these surface molecules.
RESULTS: HLA-DR expression was significantly increased on intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and enterocytes from patients with RA (n = 13) compared with the 2 control groups (p<0.01). Immunohistochemistry also revealed increased expression of HLA-DR on enterocytes from patients with RA. RA IEL (n = 6) expressed significantly higher levels of CD44 (p<0.02). In the lamina propria, a small but significant gammadelta T lymphocyte population (mean 5.5%, range 2-12%) was detected in rheumatoid factor positive RA patients (n = 8) compared with RF negative RA patients (n = 8, mean 2%, range 0.4-6%; p<0.01) and the disease control group (n = 15, mean 2%, range 0.5-5%; p<0.01). None of these changes were detectable in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with RA.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates evidence of activation of specific components of the GI immune system in RA. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from patients with RA did not show increased expression of activation markers, suggesting that changes in the RA GI tract are not systemic but localized. Moreover, these changes appear to be independent of NSAID therapy."

We assessed resting energy expenditure (REE) in relation to nutritional status and body composition in patients with JRA.
METHODS: We selected 33 children (age 6 to 18 yrs) with JRA (13 oligoarticular, 10 polyarticular, 10 systemic JRA) and 17 controls matched for age and sex. Nutritional status was assessed for height, weight, and fat-free mass (FFM), and REE was measured with indirect calorimetry.
RESULTS: Nutritional status in the patients with systemic JRA was diminished compared to the controls for height (140 vs. 159 cm; p<0.01) and FFM (28 vs. 38 kg; p = 0.03). Oligo and polyarticular patients with JRA had normal height and FFM. No significant differences existed in crude REE among the groups. However, after correcting REE for body weight and FFM, the patients with systemic JRA, compared to controls, had 18% higher REE per kg body weight (159 vs. 134 kJ/kg/day; p<0.01) and 21% higher REE per kg FFM (196 vs. 162 kJ/kg/day; p<0.01). Oligo and polyarticular JRA patients had 8% increased values for REE per kg body weight or FFM, but these differences were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Patients with systemic JRA show stunting, low FFM, and a significantly increased REE when nutritional status is taken into account. These data suggest that assessment of individual energy requirements should include correction for fat-free mass in the treatment of malnutrition in patients with systemic JRA."

Thrombocyte counts of patients with SSc and RA and controls were recorded.
RESULTS: Median TPO concentrations were 115 (164) in SSc, 76 (32) in RA, and 62 (34) pg/ml in controls. Median serum TPO concentration in the SSc group was significantly higher than other groups; there was no difference between controls and patients with RA (p<0.001 for both comparisons).

There was no correlation between thrombocyte counts and TPO levels in any group.
CONCLUSION: We show that patients with SSc have higher serum TPO concentrations compared to healthy controls and patients with RA. It can be hypothesized that TPO mediated release of particular growth factors may participate in the pathogenesis of the fibrotic process of SSc."

Side effects, usually involving the gastrointestinal tract, occurred in 20.9% of patients treated with lornoxicam and 19% of those treated with diclofenac. Side effects caused premature discontinuation of therapy in 10 (6.3%) patients in the lornoxicam group and 7 (4.4%) in the diclofenac group. For treatment of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, lornoxicam was as effective as diclofenac sodium. Its safety was comparable to that of diclofenac, which is considered one of the best-tolerated NSAIDs."

9259575,,10.2165/00044011-199509030-00007,"A randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate, by endoscopic examination, the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment on gastric and duodenal mucosa. Men and women, aged 55 years or older, with chronic osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, requiring anti-inflammatory therapy for at least 3 months prior to the study, were enrolled. Patients were randomised to receive either diclofenac sodium 150 mg/day or naproxen 1000 mg/day. Patients were permitted to take paracetamol as a rescue analgesic and antacid tablets. Endoscopy revealed an increase in gastrointestinal findings after treatment (compared with baseline) in 29% of the diclofenac sodium group versus 65% of the naproxen group (p<0.001). A total of 111 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and 113 treated with naproxen were evaluated for efficacy. 25 of the 111 (22.5%) patients who received diclofenac sodium and 27 of the 113 (23.9%) who received naproxen had a history of ulcers. Of the patients with a history of ulcers, 23 treated with diclofenac sodium and 25 treated with naproxen had both pre- and post-treatment endoscopies. Six of those 23 (26.1%) patients in the diclofenac sodium group and 18 of the 25 (72%) in the naproxen group had an increase in endoscopic findings post-treatment. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms was significantly higher among patients treated with naproxen than among those treated with diclofenac sodium (p = 0.019). Of the 101 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and the 103 patients treated with naproxen who were evaluated for safety, more ulcers occurred in the naproxen group (41; 40%) than in the diclofenac sodium group (13; 12.9%). Ulcers greater than or equal5mm were more frequent in the naproxen group (18%) than in the diclofenac sodium group (8%). These findings demonstrate a significantly greater incidence of gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients treated with naproxen, as well as a greater incidence of endoscopic evidence of mucosal irritation/damage of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa, than in patients treated with diclofenac sodium. Gastropathy secondary to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is the single most common complication reported for any class of medications. These complications result in bleeding incidents, perforations, disability and death. They are most frequently associated with chronic NSAID use in the elderly (persons 60 years of age and older), who constitute the most frequent users of NSAIDs, the most commonly used class of drugs in medical practice today. This older population is at an increased risk for NSAID gastropathy, and members of this group are most likely to have silent ulcers, which can ultimately lead to gastrointestinal complications and bleeding. Indeed, they have up to 5 times the risk of serious gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation and death. This study was conducted to evaluate the endoscopy findings in elderly patients being treated for at least 3 months with diclofenac sodium and with naproxen. The development of gastric or duodenal ulcers was chosen as the measurement end-point; however, it is unknown whether endoscopic findings can predict the future occurrence of haemorrhage or perforation. To provide maximum clinical and statistical validity, this study was conducted in a large number of patients, including those with and without a history of ulcers. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.

Dose adjustments were performed according to tolerability and efficacy. With 168 patients eligible for evaluation the rate of withdrawal for any reason was 26% in group A and 27% in B. Withdrawal due to side effects occurred in 16% versus 18%, dose reduction due to side effects in 10% versus 9%. The higher dose was associated with a significantly higher rate of gastrointestinal side effects (28% vs. 17%, p < 0.05) and a tendency for more frequent elevations of transaminases. Other side effects were not dose dependent. A significantly higher rate of dose reduction due to improvement (35% versus 10%, p < 0.001), a more rapid decline of morning stiffness, and a higher number of patients reporting marked improvement are evidence in favour of higher therapeutic efficacy of the higher dose. In conclusion, an initial dose of 25 mg MTX/week is not associated with a higher rate of limiting side effects as compared with 15 mg /week. The efficacy of doses up to 25 mg/week should be examined in more detail. Copyright ¬¨¬© 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved."

The 58 patients had a total of 75 surgically treated knees. Arthroscopic synovectomy was performed on 37 knees of 30 patients, who were followed on average for 5 years and 4 months. Open synovectomy was performed on 38 knees of 28 patients, who were followed on average for 5 years and 5 months. The analysis included evaluation for: recurrence rate and recurrence time of synovitis; duration of symptom-free period; incidence of progressive bone changes on radiography; range of motion (ROM); duration of hospital stay; and duration of surgery. In the arthroscopic synovectomy group, there was no restriction of ROM after surgery, shorter hospital stay, and lower incidence of osteoarthritic changes. However, the effect of surgery lasted for only 18 months on average and recurrence of synovitis was observed in 73% of the patients. In the open synovectomy group, due to restricted ROM in some patients, post-operative treatment was required and the hospital stay tended to be longer. Nevertheless, the recurrence rate was only 37% during the follow-up period (p < 0.01 compared to arthroscopic synovectomy group), and the effect of surgery persisted for an average of 75 months, much longer than that in the arthroscopic synovectomy group. In the treatment of RA knees, the indications for both arthroscopic and open synovectomy should be studied carefully in the light of the strengths and limitations of each procedure.

Assessment of pain (visual analogue scale) duration of morning stiffness, grip strength and articular index all showed similar and highly significant improvements over placebo with both active drugs. There were no significant differences between the active drugs. Paradoxically the corresponding significant reduction in paracetamol consumption with diclofenac was not seen during indoprofen treatment. Twenty-two preferred indoprofen to placebo and 21 preferred diclofenac to placebo, these preferences being statistically significant. There was no net preference for one or other of the active drugs. Ring size showed no significant change during the study, presumably reflecting the short treatment duration. A series of biochemical and haematological screening investigations revealed few changes during treatment with either active drug. Abnormalities of liver function tests in three patients during diclofenac treatment and one during indoprofen treatment could possibly be drug-related. Gastro-intestinal symptoms and headache were the only drug-related side-effects reported. Although there was a somewhat higher incidence of gastro-intestinal symptoms in indoprofen-treated patients, there were no significant differences between treatments with respect to the incidence of any symptoms. It is concluded that, in the doses used in this short-term study, indoprofen and diclofenac are both effective and that the efficacy and side-effects of both drugs are very similar.

Twenty-nine patients with Sjogren's syndrome were therefore assigned to 2 randomized double-blind crossover trials with bromhexine and placebo, each comprising two 2-wk periods. In the first trial bromhexine 24 mg/day was given by mouth; in the second the dose was increased to 48 mg/day. After each treatment period the Schirmer test response, break-up time, Bijsterveld score, and the time taken for the patient to eat a dry biscuit were recorded, as well as the patient's estimate of moistness in the eyes and mouth. In the second (higher-dose) trial values on the Schirmer test were significantly higher after bromhexine than after placebo and the break-up time was also increased after bromhexine, which suggested that the drug has a dose-dependent effect on lacrimal gland secretion in Sjogren's syndrome. It had no effect on salivary gland function. Bromhexine is therefore valuable in the treatment of Sjogren's syndrome. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved."

This assumption is at present under investigation within the framework of a double-blind comparative study conducted elsewhere, i.e. at other clinical centres. So far, 121 patients have been included in the study; of these, 68 patients were treated for longer than one year. In accordance with a randomising scheme, the patients were allocated either to the Auranofin or to the Aurothiomalat group, in each case together with the corresponding placebo. The parameters examined at regular intervals were: the number of joints involved, the joint index, grip strength, pain, morning stiffness and feeling of general well-being. All these examinations were performed within the treatment period. The blood sedimentation rate and other important laboratory findings were controlled regularly. Considerable improvement was seen in both groups. The number of undesirable side effects was equal in both groups. Gastrointestinal reactions, especially diarrhoeas, occurred twice as often in the Aurothiomalat group than in the Auranofin group; on the other hand, mucosal changes were seen twice as often in that group.

The principal aim of treatment is to retain the patient's mobility, reduce inflammation and attenuate articular pain, maintaining grip strength and correcting articular deformities. The objective of the study was to verify that tenoxicam satisfies these requirements. Nineteen adult out-patients diagnosed as 'classic' rheumatoid arthritis as defined in agreement with the ARA criteria were treated using a double-blind regimen. The patients were randomly divided into two groups receiving either tenoxicam 20 mg/day or piroxicam 20 mg/day before breakfast for a period of six months. From the 7th to the 12th month, all evaluable patients received tenoxicam alone (20 mg/day before breakfast). This second period allowed for better evaluation of tolerance and long-term efficacy in those who had already received tenoxicam during the first period, and a comparison of the action of this preparation with piroxicam in those who received both drugs in the crossover schedule. Standard physiotherapy was maintained without modification during the whole trial. Before commencing the study, the usual laboratory analyses were made, and at each monthly visit the efficacy and tolerance of the drug were evaluated. This study demonstrated that tenoxicam, given orally, once daily, is effective and well tolerated in the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults, with an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect comparable to that of piroxicam.

Each active treatment phase lasted four weeks and was preceded by a one-week washout period. Significant improvement was observed at the end of each therapy. Piroxicam was significantly more effective than naproxen 500 in decreasing the duration of morning stiffness (P < 0.01), whereas naproxen 1,000 and piroxicam did not differ significantly in effectiveness. Most efficacy measures indicated more rapid improvement at two weeks of therapy with piroxicam compared with naproxen 500. When asked to state a preference, 70% of the patients selected piroxicam over naproxen 500 (P < 0.05), while there was no difference in the patients' preference between piroxicam and naproxen 1,000.

One hundred and sixteen patients aged 18 to 75 years were randomised to receive either one capsule of flurbiprofen sustained-release 200 mg (n=60) or one tablet of ketoprofen sustained-release 200 mg (n=56). Both drugs were taken once daily in the evening for 28 days. Patients were assessed at entry and after two and four weeks. Overall efficacy as evaluated on a four-point scale by the investigator and patient, and overall spontaneous pain as evaluated by the patient showed significant improvements in both treatment groups with a trend favouring greater benefit with flurbiprofen. Adverse events were recorded in 14 patients receiving flurbiprofen and 22 patients receiving ketoprofen. Neither the incidence nor the type of adverse events were significantly different in the two groups. Withdrawal rates for adverse events were very similar with both drugs.

Two hundred and twenty-five patients (59 men, 166 women; mean age, 56.3 years; range, 25 to 80 years) - 100 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 125 patients with osteoarthritis - were enrolled in the study. Drug treatments were administered orally, once daily, for 12 weeks. The indices of efficacy (evaluation of the pain condition, severity of the inflammation, functional impairment) evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks showed the good analgesic effect of piroxicam without significant differences between its two formulations. Tolerance appeared to be better in the group of patients treated with beta-cyclodextrin-piroxicam than in the group treated with piroxicam. Both the incidence and severity of side-effects were lower for patients treated with beta-cyclodextrinpiroxicam. As expected, the majority of side-effects were related to the gastrointestinal tract. Only one piroxicam-treated patient had to discontinue the test drug because of alterations in laboratory values (increase in liver function tests). The study suggests that beta-cyclodextrin-piroxicam, used in the long-term treatment of rheumatic diseases, improves the safety of piroxicam without affecting its efficacy.

The second study included 230 patients with osteoarthritis (OA): 80 patients received etodolac SR 400 mg q.d., 76 received etodolac SR 600 mg q.d., and 74 received etodolac 300 mg b.i.d. Efficacy was evaluated by physician's global and patient's global assessments (both studies), number of painful joints (RA study), number of swollen joints (RA study), pain intensity (OA study), and weight-bearing pain (OA study). The interim analyses of the data from the studies indicates that all three regimens produced significant improvements from baseline in all mean efficacy values at each assessment; there were no significant differences between the treatment groups. The incidence of study events, except for dyspepsia, was comparable among the treatment groups in each study; dyspepsia occurred at a significantly lower rate in patients treated with etodolac SR than in patients treated with the conventional formulation of etodolac.

While prostaglandine synthesis can be influenced by NSAIDs therapeutical approaches to the 5-lipoxygenase pathway are rare. Resinous extracts of Boswellia serrata (H15, indish incense), known from traditional ayurvedic medicine, decrease leukotriene synthesis in vitro. Case reports suggest a clinical role for that drug. Methods: Outpatients with active RA have been enrolled into a multicenter controlled trial. Patients received 9 tablets of active drug (3600 mg) or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy. Doses of NSAIDs could be adjusted on demand. Efficacy parameters, Ritchies Index for swelling and pain, ESR, CRP, pain on VAS and NSAID dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation. Mean values and medians were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation. Results: A total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers, the data have been published in abstractform. Only 37 patients (verum 18, placebo 19), enrolled in Ratingen were available for detailled efficacy and safety analysis. All evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator (G.H.). There was no subjective, clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation. The mean NSAID dose reduction reached levels of 5.8% (H15) and 3.1% (placebo). One patient in each group showed a good response in all parameters but 4 patients in each group worsened. The others showed no alteration of their disease. Conclusion: Treatment with H15 showed no measurable efficacy. Controlled studies including a greater patient population are necessary to confirm or reject our results. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved."

METHODS: In a crossover study 23 patients were administered MTX intramuscularly at either 10 AM or 6 PM. A 2 week interval separated the 2 injections. MTX concentrations were measured using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Pharmacokinetic variables were estimated using a Bayesian approach. The morning and evening schedules were compared using analysis of variance to determine the optimal time of injection.
RESULTS: No statistical difference was found in the pharmacokinetics of MTX according to hour of injection. A difference in the creatinine clearance, however, was observed in the samples obtained at noon and 8 PM, but clearance of MTX was unchanged.
CONCLUSION: Pharmacokinetic variables suggest that MTX can be administered either in the morning (10 AM) or evening (6 PM) in the treatment of RA."

Daily starting doses were 2000 to 3000 mg salicylate as contained in CMT, or 500 to 750 mg naproxone, and these were subsequently adjusted to individual needs. The patients had previously taken nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS), which were withdrawn before the study, the disease being allowed to flare before introduction of the test drugs. Fifty-eight patients received CMT and 56 were given naproxen. An additional 25 and 24 patients, respectively, received these medications but did not qualify for inclusion in the efficacy evaluation and were studied for drug safety only.

METHODS AND RESULTS: 40 patients with active seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (average age 42.8 years, average duration of disease 2.8 years) received Tauredon in a dosage of 50 mg/week intramuscularly. 19 patients (47.5%) developed mucocutaneous side effects. Four of them were excluded from the study because of severe skin reactions. In 15 patients with mild or moderate side-effects (local skin rash and stomatitis) aurotherapy was continued after the resolution of adverse reactions. Four out of the 15 patients were withdrawn from the study after restarting the lower dose treatment due to recurrence of dermatitis. 11 out of 19 patients finished 1 year of study with low dose Tauredon. Clinical remission occurred in 4 patients (36.4%) while improvement was registered in 6 patients (54.5%). In one patient (9.1%) no clinical effect was observed. None of these 11 demonstrated any Tauredon toxicity.
CONCLUSION: The development of mucocutaneous side-effects should not be considered as an absolute contraindication for the continuation of gold compound therapy. A low dose regimen may allow maintenance of therapeutic effect and improve tolerance in this group of patients. Gold salts, such as disodium aurothiomalate (ATMO have been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for over 70 years. They suppress inflammation and retard radiological progression of joint damage [1], but their use is limited by a high incidence of toxic side-effects in about 30% of patients. The commonest side-effect of chrysotherapy is skin toxicity, accounting for up to 60% of all adverse reactions [2]. Rash is most frequent in the first year of therapy, but can occur at any time. Stomatitis occurs in 1-12% of patients and may occur concomitantly with skin rash. The causes of skin rash and stomatitis are still unknown. When mucocutaneous reactions develop, the drug should be withheld until the condition resolves [3]. Approximately 2-3% of patients have to stop treatment because of severe skin rash and mouth ulcers [4]. However we, together with other authors [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] consider that mild to moderate mucocutaneous reactions are not an absolute contraindication for the continuation of gold therapy. The aim of our study is to examine the possibility for the continuation of therapy after achieving clinical improvement in patients with skin rash and stomatitis as a result of treatment with ATM (Tauredon, ""Byk Gulden"", Germany)."

METHODS: All patients admitted to our unit with active RA without exclusion criteria were invited to participate and randomized to subcutaneous synacthen depot 0.5 mg on alternate days for 2 injections or 2 injections of saline. Patients, staff, and assessors of response were blinded to the intervention. Assessment [OMERACT set, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) global improvement, dose of intraarticular (IA) or intramuscular (IM) methylprednisolone] was performed at admission to hospital, at discharge, and at 3 and 6 months. Oral prednisone use constituted a protocol violation.
RESULTS: Of 137 patients with RA admitted over the period of recruitment, 36 (26%) were enrolled; 31 completed followup. There were no between-group differences in the change from admission of any individual disease activity measure at any time point. However, using a rigorous global response measure (ACR 50%), a difference was detected in favor of synacthen depot at discharge (52.6% of the intervention group improved vs. 17.6% of controls; p = 0.029, number-needed-to-treat 2.86). Patients treated with synacthen depot showed a trend toward more IA or IM corticosteroid between discharge and 3 months (mean dose 56 vs. 31 mg; p = 0.19) and a trend toward more patients requiring a change in slow acting antirheumatic drug after discharge (4 vs. 1; p = 0.27).
CONCLUSION: There is some additional benefit of synacthen depot in the hospital treatment of RA, but the effect is lost by 3 months, with a suggestion of rebound worsening in these patients. We postulate that oversuppression of corticotrophin releasing hormone by exogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone in patients who already have a hypothalamic deficit may contribute to the rebound worsening of disease activity seen in these patients."

METHODS: a total of 249 participants in a randomized trial of treatment strategies were divided into 4 groups according to their APF (or CCP) and RF status at baseline. Differences in disability, joint involvement and radiological damage over a 3-year period were analysed.
RESULTS: aPF-IIF results differed from CCP-ELISA in 42 cases (17%); 38 of the 42 had a positive IIF and negative ELISA value. Disability after 3 years did not differ significantly between the RF and APF groups. APF- patients had significantly lower Thompson joint scores compared to APF+ patients (6 vs 24 for CCP-ELISA; 2 vs 24 for IIF). RF+APF+ patients exhibited more radiological damage compared to RF-APF- patients. RF+APF- and RF-APF+ patients had intermediate scores. Within the RF+ and RF- groups, APF+ was associated with more radiological damage and thus yielded prognostic information in addition to RF. In this respect, the results of ELISA and IIF were comparable. Thirty percent of the RF+APF+ patients had a radiological score higher than 45, compared to 13% of the RF+APF-, none of the RF-APF+, and 2% of RF-APF- patients (p < 0.001). In addition, more large joints were affected in APF+ than in APF- patients, while no difference was observed between RF+ and RF- patients.
CONCLUSION: APF has prognostic value in addition to RF for joint involvement and radiological damage in early RA. The CCP-ELISA technique for APF assessment may facilitate its use in clinical practice. However, the prognostic value of the two tests lies in their ability to predict mild disease. Reliable identification at baseline of individual patients with progressive disease is still not possible."

We selected 41 women (age: 32-52 yrs) who were recently diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematodes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or asthma bronchiale. Patients did not have other disease or take drugs known to influence bone metabolism. Patients were randomly enrolled into two groups and were given 5-25 mg prednisone daily. After 4 weeks, group A (n = 21) received 0.5-1.0 microgram (mean = 0.54 +/- 0.03 microgram) alphacalcidol and group B (control; n = 20) was given 500 mg calcium daily for three years. There were no significant differences in age and steroid doses between groups. Serum calcium (Ca), osteocalcin (OC), collagen I C-terminal propeptide (PICP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and urinary calcium and deoxypyridinoline crosslink excretion (DPD) were measured before corticosteroid administration, and before alphacalcidol or calcium treatment as well as 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years later. Bone mineral density (BMD) was examined before treatment and 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years later by DEXA and SPA. OC and PICP decreased significantly after 4 weeks on steroid in both groups and increased in group A but not in group B after 6 weeks of treatment with alphacalcidol and remained unchanged for 3 years. Serum PTH increased in both groups after 4 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment and was reduced in group A, but not in group B, after 6 weeks on alphacalcidol. Serum Ca, urinary Ca, and DPD did not change significantly in either group during the study period. Lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD were significantly reduced in group B after 6 months and 1 year, respectively, and continued to decrease during the study, while no significant change in group A was observed. BMD of the radius did not change in either group for 2 years but there was a significant reduction by the third year in group B. Based on these results, alphacalcidol treatment appears to be effective in preventing glucocorticoid-induced bone loss in these patients by reducing secondary hyperparathyroidism and stimulating bone formation."

Heart transplant cases lost considerably more bone immediately after transplantation than liver and lung transplant recipients. A positive effect of 2 years alfacalcidol treatment (0.5-1 microgram/day) on bone loss was observed in all treated groups.

METHODS: BMC was measured in 20 children (of whom 17 were treated with corticosteroid) before and after one year of rhGH. Children were randomized to receive either low dose (12 IU/m2/week) or high dose (24 IU/m2/week) for one year. Three monthly assessments were made of disease activity and anthropomorphic measurements. Blood and urine samples were also obtained to measure indicators of disease activity, bone remodeling, and vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) status.
RESULTS: BMC increased during the treatment period and correlated with increasing height. Osteocalcin levels, normally indicators of bone formation, increased after rhGH treatment and correlated significantly with height velocity, particularly for the high dose treatment group. In contrast, osteocalcin levels were negatively correlated with C-reactive protein levels, both before and during treatment. Height velocity, vitamin D, PTH, and osteocalcin levels were significantly lower than age matched controls before treatment.
CONCLUSION: Steroid treated children with both JCA and severe growth retardation have reduced vitamin D, PTH, and osteocalcin levels. After treatment with rhGH, height velocity increased, as did BMC. Growth hormone might be a useful adjunct in the treatment of severe growth retardation and osteoporosis in children with JCA. The longterm benefits of rhGH in the treatment of osteoporosis remain unclear."

9259767,,10.1079/bjn2000234,"The effects of a strict uncooked vegan diet on serum lipid and sterol concentrations were studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The subjects were randomized into a vegan diet group (n 16), who consumed a vegan diet for 2-3 months, or into a control group (n 13), who continued their usual omnivorous diets. Serum total and LDL-cholesterol and -phospholipid concentrations were significantly decreased by the vegan diet. The levels of serum cholestanol and lathosterol also decreased, but serum cholestanol:total cholesterol and lathosterol:total cholesterol did not change. The effect of a vegan diet on serum plant sterols was divergent as the concentration of campesterol decreased while that of sitosterol increased. This effect resulted in a significantly greater sitosterol:campesterol value in the vegan diet group than in the control group (1.48 (SD 0.39) v. 0.72 (SD 0.14); P < 0.001). A higher concentration of campesterol compared with sitosterol is normal in omnivorous subjects and can be explained by lower absorption and esterification rates of sitosterol. Our results suggest that a strict uncooked vegan diet changes the relative absorption rates of these sterols and/or their biliary clearance."

The overall adjectival pain score was significantly better in the Surgam-SR group when compared with the Surgam group at 6 months (p < 0.01). A similar trend was observed for the other variables but was not statistically significant. Two gastrointestinal adverse events - pyrosis and epigastric burning - were identified. One patient with headache and one with elevated liver enzymes were withdrawn from the study. Abnormal laboratory values were found in 14/50 patients. Four with elevated liver enzymes were deemed clinically significant. Conclusions: The efficacy of Surgam-SR remained stable throughout the 6-month study. The tolerance of long-term use of Surgam-SR is clinically acceptable."

The difference of reactive hyperaemia between both temperature methods as well as the influence on consensual reaction should be found out. Subjects: 40 patients suffering from arthritis and the same number of healthy human subjects had been assigned numerically in the therapy groups with temperature increasing arm bath or mud pack. Patients with further diseases influencing peripheral blood flow were excluded. Design: Blood flow was measured by venous-occlusion plethysmography in both forearms with the subjects lying supine. The application of the local heat therapies had been executed on the left forearm. Forearm blood flow was monitored before heat therapy, directly after as well as in two further 10- minutes intervals. An analysis of variance was used to determine the influence of the response to heat therapy on blood flow in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy subjects. Results: There were no significant differences in forearm blood flow at rest. After heat therapies, the reactive values of blood flow showed highly significant differences between both methods of heat therapy. Differences between the patients and the healthy subjects only showed tendencies with lower reactions for the patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Both methods of heat therapy was following by a statistically significant consensual reaction. Conclusions: In tendency, the patients concerned showed less significant reaction after both methods of heat therapy so that it may be assumed that a vascular functional deficit cannot be excluded as discussed in literature. Temperature increasing arm bath and mud pack induce a significant increase of local and consensual forearm blood flow, but it is fading more quickly again after the application of temperature increasing arm bath. This result leads to the conclusion that there are differences in temperature distribution between these methods of therapy."

METHODS: we measured serum concentrations of DHEAS and IL-6 in 23 RA patients with active disease, 10 of whom followed a 7-day sub-total fast and 13 of whom consumed a ketogenic diet (isoenergetic, carbohydrate < 40 g/day) for 7 days. Clinical and laboratory variables were measured at baseline, on day 7 and after re-feeding on day 21. Correlation analyses were used to assess the associations between serum IL-6, DHEAS and disease activity variables at each timepoint.
RESULTS: fasting, but not the ketogenic diet, decreased serum IL-6 concentrations by 37% (p < 0.03) and improved disease activity at day 7. Both fasting and the ketogenic diet increased serum DHEAS levels by 34% as compared with baseline (both p < 0.006). Levels of IL-6, but not DHEAS, correlated with several disease activity variables.
CONCLUSION: both fasting and a ketogenic diet significantly increased serum DHEAS concentrations in RA patients. Only fasting significantly decreased serum IL-6 levels and improved disease activity. As the increases in serum DHEAS were similar in response to both fasting and a ketogenic diet, it is unlikely that the fall in serum IL-6 or clinical improvements after fasting were directly related to increases in serum DHEAS. The fasting-induced fall in serum IL-6 may underlie the fall in CRP and ESR observed in RA patients in response to a 7-day fast."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A double blind randomised controlled trial of effectiveness and tolerance of anticytokine antibodies was conducted in 30 patients with active RA. The drugs were given i.m. for 5 consecutive days. The results were assessed on day 7 and 28.
RESULTS: Antibodies to both cytokines produced a marked therapeutic effect in RA, much greater than placebo effect. Improvement by day 7 was achieved in 9, 7 and 2 patients on anti-TNF-a, anti-INF-g and placebo, respectively. By day 28 in 8, 8 and 0 patients, respectively. Tolerance of anticytokines was good. Significant differences between the results of treatment with anti-INF-g and anti-TNF-a were not found.
CONCLUSION: Administration of antibodies to INF-a proved ineffective and well tolerated method in the treatment of severe RA resistant for a number of standard basic drugs. Anti-IFN-a holds great promise when used in combination with classic antirheumatoid drugs, primarily with methotrexate."
9259839,,10.1186/ar341,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of doxycycline on disease activity and joint destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: A 36 week double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial was conducted. Patients (n = 66) received 50 mg doxycycline or placebo twice a day during 12, 24, or 36 weeks. Patient assessments were performed before the treatment was administered, at 6, 12, 24 and 36 weeks of treatment, and finally at 4 weeks after cessation of treatment. Patient assessments, swollen and tender joint counts, duration of morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and Modified Disease Activity Score were used as measures of disease activity. Effects on joint destruction were assessed by urinary excretion of the pyridinolines hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridinoline and by scoring radiographic damage of hands and feet before and after treatment.
RESULTS: The changes of clinical or laboratory disease activity measures, pyridinoline excretion, or progression of radiographic joint damage during doxycycline or placebo treatment did not differ significantly.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that 50 mg doxycycline twice a day provided no therapeutic benefit for patients with RA."

Both s-TfR and serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Routine laboratory tests were also performed, including peripheral blood analysis and determination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), serum iron levels, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and serum ferritin levels. The s-TfR levels in the 50 RA patients (mean +/- SD, 1,801 +/- 512 ng/ml) were significantly higher than those in the 20 control subjects (1,316 +/- 345 ng/ml). There were no differences in the values of s-TfR between men and women in either group, or between RA patients over and under 50 years old. Serum EPO levels in 47 RA patients were as low as 14.0 +/- 10.1 mlU/ml (mean +/- SD), ranging from 3.9 to 58.7 mIU/ml (normal range 2.8-17.2 mlU/ml), unrelated to low haemoglobin concentration. The s-TfR levels in RA patients showed negative correlations with red blood cell count, serum iron level and haemoglobin concentration, and positive correlations with ESR and serum EPO levels. However, there were no correlations between s-TfR level and markers of inflammation such as CRP, platelet count or RF titre. In conclusion, s-TfR level in RA patients could be a marker of erythropoiesis rather than of joint inflammation."

9259862,,10.1136/bmj.280.6207.75,"Gastroscopy was performed in 164 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 85 with osteoarthritis (OA) to assess the effects of anti-inflammatory agents on the stomach. The main criterion for entry into the trial was the absence of active gastric lesions on pretreatment endoscopy. The patients were divided into groups to receive one of 12 anti-inflammatory drugs or combinations of these. Gastroscopy repeated at 3 to 6 and at 12 mth disclosed gastric lesions in 78 cases (31%), patients in both disease categories being similarly affected. Lesions occurred in 41 of the 177 patients (23%) receiving a single drug and in 37 of the 72 (51%) receiving combined treatment. All the anti-inflammatory drugs caused gastric damage, the greatest offender being aspirin (13 out of 26 patients) and the least sulindac and diflunisal (2 out of 19 (11%) and 2 out of 20 (10%) patients respectively). Corticosteroids caused gastric damage in only 3 out of 21 patients (14%), a lower incidence than expected. The indiscriminate prescribing of anti-inflammatory drugs to patients with OA is to be deplored. A lack of correlation between the patients' subjective complaints of gastric discomfort and the gastroscopic findings emphasises the unreliability of patients' complaints and the importance of gastroscopy in assessing gastric tolerance. It was not possible to assess minimal prescribing doses or minimum periods of treatment below which gastric damage may be guaranteed not to occur."

Along with synovial joint inflammation, extra-articular involvement is a common feature of RA. Periarticular and generalized osteoporosis are seen both as an extra-articular feature of the disease itself and due to various medications like glucocorticoids and methotrexate (MTX). In this study, we investigated the effects of oral alendronate in RA patients treated with MTX and prednisolone by comparing the effects of ""alendronate + calcium"" and ""only calcium"" on bone mineral density (BMD). Fifty RA patients classified according to American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria were included in the study. The control group consisted of 20 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients. The RA patients were divided randomly into two groups. All patients were started on MTX 7.5 mg/week, 2.5-mg daily folic acid, and 7.5-mg daily prednisolone. The first group, consisting of 25 female RA patients, was also given 10-mg daily alendronate and 1000-mg daily calcium. The second group also consisted of 25 female patients and was given only 1000-mg calcium per day. The postmenopausal control group was given daily 10-mg alendronate and 1000-mg calcium. Bone mineral densities were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and again at the end of the sixth month. At the end of the study, RA patients given only calcium had reduced mean BMD, and patients treated with alendronate and calcium showed increased mean BMD almost in all regions. This increase was significant in the L2 and L1-4 total regions. In postmenopausal osteoporotic patients, we saw statistically significant increases in BMD in all regions. The increase in BMD values in RA patients treated with alendronate was smaller than in those of the control group of postmenopausal osteoporosis patients. In conclusion, RA itself has a risk factor for osteoporosis in addition to the risks of the medications like corticosteroids and MTX. In the prevention and treatment of RA-associated osteoporosis, alendronate and calcium therapy is effective and well tolerated."

It is usually given on a weekly schedule, but as the half-life of its active compound, the polyglutamate MTX, is 3 days, we did a pilot study to see if MTX twice weekly is superior to MTX once weekly. Eighty patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were enrolled into a double-blind, controlled trial of 16-week duration. Patients achieving ACR scores of 20 and 50 were determined at 8 and 16 weeks. In addition, the incidence of hepatotoxicity was also studied. Of the 80 patients, 66 completed 8 weeks of study, whereas 53 completed 16 weeks of study. Most withdrawals were because of inefficacy. At 8 weeks, ACR 20 response (24/34 in once weekly and 22/32 in twice weekly) and ACR 50 response (16/34 in once weekly and 16/32 in twice weekly) in both groups were similar. Even at 16 weeks, there was no significant difference in ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses. Intent-to-treat analysis also yielded similar results. Five patients in each group had a mild reversible rise in transaminases. Our study suggests that MTX twice weekly has no advantage over once weekly regarding efficacy, and thus the currently used once weekly regimen is good enough till alternate dosing schedules are evaluated in a large multicentric trial."

METHODS: A double blind, randomized, placebo and active comparator controlled, 12 week study conducted at 88 US sites. Eligible patients were chronic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) users with clinical worsening of RA upon withdrawal of prestudy NSAID. Patients received either placebo, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily, or naproxen 500 mg twice daily (2:2:1 allocation ratio). Primary efficacy measures: patient and investigator global assessments of disease activity and direct assessment of arthritis by counts of tender and swollen joints. Key secondary measures: patient global assessment of pain, the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, and the percentage of patients both completing the study and meeting the ACR20 criteria. Tolerability was assessed by tabulation of adverse events and routine laboratory evaluations.
RESULTS: In all, 816 patients were randomized (placebo = 323, etoricoxib = 323, naproxen = 170), and 448 completed 12 weeks of treatment (placebo = 122, etoricoxib = 230, naproxen = 96). Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving etoricoxib and naproxen showed significant improvements in all efficacy endpoints (p < 0.01).

9259891,,10.2147/oarrr.s11386,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the bioavailability of methotrexate (MTX) in the presence of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and vice versa, to determine a possible pharmacokinetic explanation for the observation that combination treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with MTX and HCQ has been shown, clinically, to be more potent than MTX used alone.
METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, 10 healthy subjects received, on each of 5 dosing occasions, MTX alone as tablets or intravenous solution, HCQ alone as a tablet or oral solution, or a coadministered dose of MTX tablets with an HCQ tablet. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was determined for each subject, on each dosing occasion, for each compound.
RESULTS: The mean AUC for MTX was increased (p = 0.005) and the maximum MTX concentration (Cmax) decreased (p = 0.025) when MTX was coadministered with HCQ, compared to MTX administered alone. The time to reach Cmax for MTX administration, tmax, was also increased during the coadministration with HCQ (p = 0.072). The AUC of HCQ showed no significant difference (p = 0.957) between any of the dosing occasions.
CONCLUSION: These results may explain the increased potency of the MTX-HCQ combination over MTX as a single agent and also the sustained effects of MTX when administered with HCQ. In addition, the reduced Cmax of MTX observed during the coadministration may explain diminution of acute liver adverse effects. Extra vigilance for MTX adverse effects during combination therapy with HCQ is recommended, especially if renal function is known to be decreased."
9259895,,10.1136/bjsm.35.5.348,"BACKGROUND: Exercise programs improve balance, strength and agility in elderly people and thus may prevent falls. However, specific exercise programs that might be widely used in the community and that might be ""prescribed"" by physicians, especially for patients with osteoporosis, have not been evaluated. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of such a program designed specifically for women with osteoporosis.
METHODS: We identified women 65 to 75 years of age in whom osteoporosis had been diagnosed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in our hospital between 1996 and 2000 and who were not engaged in regular weekly programs of moderate or hard exercise. Women who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to participate in a twice-weekly exercise class or to not participate in the class. We measured baseline data and, 20 weeks later, changes in static balance (by dynamic posturography), dynamic balance (by a timed figure-eight run) and knee extension strength (by dynamometry).
RESULTS: Of 93 women who began the trial, 80 completed it. Before adjustment for covariates, the intervention group tended to have greater, although nonsignificant, improvements in static balance (mean difference 4.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.3% to 11.0%), dynamic balance (mean difference 3.3%, 95% CI -1.7% to 8.4%) and knee extension strength (mean difference 7.8%, 95% CI -5.4% to 21.0%). Mean crude changes in the static balance score were -0.85 (95% CI -2.91 to 1.21) for the control group and 1.40 (95% CI -0.66 to 3.46) for the intervention group. Mean crude changes in figure-eight velocity (dynamic balance) were 0.08 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.14) m/s for the control group and 0.14 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.20) m/s for the intervention group. For knee extension strength, mean changes were -0.58 (95% CI -3.02 to 1.81) kg/m for the control group and 1.03 (95% CI -1.31 to 3.34) kg/m for the intervention group. After adjustment for age, physical activity and years of estrogen use, the improvement in dynamic balance was 4.9% greater for the intervention group than for the control group (p = 0.044). After adjustment for physical activity, cognitive status and number of fractures ever, the improvement in knee extension strength was 12.8% greater for the intervention group than for the control group (p = 0.047). The intervention group also had a 6.3% greater improvement in static balance after adjustment for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.06).
INTERPRETATION: Relative to controls, participants in the exercise program experienced improvements in dynamic balance and strength, both important determinants of risk for falls, particularly in older women with osteoporosis."

We investigated the effects of both dietary measures, alone and in combination, on inflammation, fatty acid composition of erythrocyte lipids, eicosanoids, and cytokine biosynthesis in patients with RA.
METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with definitive RA were matched into two groups of 34 subjects each. One group was observed for 8 months on a normal western diet (WD) and the other on an anti-inflammatory diet (AID) providing an arachidonic acid intake of less than 90 mg/day. Patients in both groups were allocated to receive placebo or fish oil capsules (30 mg/kg body weight) for 3 months in a double-blind crossover study with a 2-month washout period between treatments. Clinical examination and routine laboratory findings were evaluated every month, and erythrocyte fatty acids, eicosanoids, and cytokines were evaluated before and after each 3-month experimental period.
RESULTS: Sixty patients completed the study. In AID patients, but not in WD patients, the numbers of tender and swollen joints decreased by 14% during placebo treatment. In AID patients, as compared to WD patients, fish oil led to a significant reduction in the numbers of tender (28% vs 11%) and swollen (34% vs 22%) joints (P<0.01). Compared to baseline levels, higher enrichment of eicosapentaenoic acid in erythrocyte lipids (244% vs 217%) and lower formation of leukotriene B(4) (34% vs 8%, P>0.01), 11-dehydro-thromboxane B(2) (15% vs 10%, P<0.05), and prostaglandin metabolites (21% vs 16%, P<0.003) were found in AID patients, especially when fish oil was given during months 6-8 of the experiment.
CONCLUSION: A diet low in arachidonic acid ameliorates clinical signs of inflammation in patients with RA and augments the beneficial effect of fish oil supplementation."

The efficacy of etidronate with respect to osteoporosis, inhibition of bone resorption and destruction, and antiinflammation in RA was examined for 72 weeks.
METHODS: Sixty-three patients with RA (56 women, 7 men) were divided into a group that received intermittent cyclical etidronate therapy (ICET) (31 patients) and a non-ICET group (32 patients). Over a 72 week followup period, the urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), bone mineral density (BMD), Larsen damage score, Lansbury activity index, and concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) of the 2 groups were compared.
RESULTS: In the non-ICET group, a significant decrease in BMD and a significant increase in the Larsen damage score were observed. In the ICET group, the level of DPD started to decrease 12 weeks after etidronate administration and progression of the Larsen damage score was significantly inhibited. IL-6 concentration was significantly decreased 72 weeks after etidronate administration. Concentrations of BAP and CRP and the Lansbury activity index were not significantly different between the ICET and the non-ICET groups. A significant correlation between the IL-6 and DPD concentrations was observed.
CONCLUSION: Etidronate was effective at inhibiting bone resorption and destruction in study patients with RA, while not increasing BAP concentrations; and a correlation was observed between the concentration of DPD and IL-6, indicating the antiinflammatory effect of etidronate."

In one the PCL was retained in the normal way and in the other it was resected. They were well matched, with a predominance of women, and a mean age of 67 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the Hospital for Special Surgery scores at a mean of 57 months (56 to 60) between the two groups although 21 patients (24 knees) were lost to follow-up. Relief from pain, correction of deformity, range of movement, stability and strength were comparable in both. Radiological assessment showed femoral rollback in approximately 20% of knees with a slightly higher incidence in the PCL-resected group. There was no significant loosening detected in either group at review at two years. At five years, one knee in the PCL-retained group had been revised because of infection and one patient in each group was awaiting revision for loosening. Our findings have shown no significant difference in the five-year results for a PCL-retaining total knee replacement if the PCL is excised or preserved. This suggests two important points. First, the PCL is not functional in most patients with a total knee replacement even when retained. Secondly, patients with an excised PCL show a good result with a PCL-retaining implant, thereby questioning the need for a posterior stabilised design in such a situation."

The anti-inflammatory effects of etanercept are due to its ability to bind to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF, preventing it from interacting with cell-surface receptors and rendering it biologically inactive. Etanercept was evaluated for the treatment of PsA and psoriasis in a preliminary study of 60 patients and in a confirmatory phase III study of 205 patients. In both studies, etanercept was shown to be significantly superior to placebo for the treatment of PsA, evaluated by Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. It also was superior to placebo in improving psoriatic skin lesions, evaluated by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and target lesion scores. Side-effects were minimal; mild injection site reactions, which resolved during continued therapy, were experienced by approximately one-quarter of the patients. Overall, etanercept is highly effective and well tolerated by patients with PsA, with a safety profile similar to that seen in rheumatoid arthritis."
9259946,,10.1136/gut.52.6.820,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies in patients with osteoarthritis have suggested that the selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor rofecoxib results in less gastrointestinal damage than non-selective non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This study compared the incidence of endoscopically detected gastroduodenal ulcers in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with rofecoxib or a non-selective NSAID.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double blind, 12 week study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis were allocated to rofecoxib 50 mg once daily (n=219), naproxen 500 mg twice daily (n=220), or placebo (n=221). Endoscopy was performed at baseline and at six and 12 weeks. Lifetable analysis and log rank tests were used to analyse the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers > or =3 mm. Gastric or duodenal ulcers > or =5 mm and erosions were also evaluated as secondary end points. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of ulcers > or =3 mm at 12 weeks was significantly higher in patients on naproxen (25.5%) than in patients receiving rofecoxib (6.8%; difference 18.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.7%, 25.7%); p<0.001) or placebo (2.9%; difference 22.6% (95% CI 16.1%, 29.1%); p<0.001). The difference between rofecoxib (6.8%) and placebo (2.9%) did not reach statistical significance (p=0.066). Results were similar for ulcers > or =5 mm and for mean changes from baseline in the number of gastroduodenal erosions. The overall incidence of clinical adverse events was similar among treatment groups (61% of patients on placebo, 62% in patients on rofecoxib, and 66% in patients on naproxen).
CONCLUSIONS: Rofecoxib 50 mg daily (twice the dose recommended for this patient population) resulted in a lower incidence of endoscopically detected gastroduodenal ulcers and erosions than treatment with naproxen 500 mg twice daily."

Our second aim was to evaluate the influence of low-dose (10-15 mg/m2/week) MTX treatment combined with folic acid supplementation (1 mg/d) or placebo on tHcy concentrations in JIA patients.
METHODS: in 17 JIA patients and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy children, baseline tHcy concentrations were measured. When MTX treatment was initiated, JIA patients were randomly assigned to folic acid 1 mg/d/p.o. followed by placebo (8 weeks each) or vice versa. Blood samples for measurement of tHcy, vitamin B6, B12 and folate were taken after 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 20 weeks of treatment.
RESULTS: 1) In the healthy children the mean tHcy concentration was 6.3 +/- 1.68 mumol/l as compared to 9.99 +/- 5.17 mumol/l in JIA patients (p < 0.04). At baseline, 5/17 JIA patients had tHcy concentrations > 10.5 mumol/l, the 99th percentile for teenagers. 3/5 patients even exceeded the upper normal level for adults (tHcy > or = 15 mumol/l). MTX treatment did not result in a significant increase of tHcy and folic acid supplementation had no significant impact on tHcy levels.
CONCLUSION: this pilot study shows that patients with JIA requiring MTX treatment have significantly elevated baseline plasma tHcy concentrations compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. No significant impact of MTX and folate supplementation on tHcy concentration was found."

In this study, a semiquantitative method providing 2 functional parameters for objective assessment of salivary gland function by scintillation camera imaging was tested.
METHODS: Twenty-one patients referred for (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scanning were studied. Two patients with salivary complaints were also included. Dynamic imaging of the anterior head using a scintillation camera was started after a bolus intravenous injection of 185 MBq (5 mCi) (99m)Tc-pertechnetate at 1 frame per 30 s for 30 min. At 15 min after injection, diluted lemon juice was administered orally. Analysis of the dynamic study included time-activity curves of 4 salivary glands (right and left parotid and right and left submandibular). Two parameters of function were defined: uptake rate, taken as the value of the initial slope of the time-activity curve, and washout fraction, which was the relative mobilizable radioactivity from each salivary gland after ingestion of the sialogogue. A parametric image of the washout fraction was also generated.
RESULTS: The images showed gradual uptake in the parotid and submandibular glands. Washout was noted immediately after ingestion of the lemon juice. The pattern of the time-activity curve in all glands showed an early fast-rising part followed by a slow-rising component to nearly a plateau within 6-10 min after injection. The mean value of the uptake rate parameter was 0.10 +/- 0.09 cps/s. There was no significant difference between the parotid and submandibular glands or the right and left sides. Uptake in the parotid gland was 1.5-2 times that in the submandibular gland. The washout fraction was 1.40 +/- 1.60 for the parotid glands and 0.77 +/- 0.41 for the submandibular glands (P = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: The quantitative analysis method including the uptake rate and the washout fraction parameters would enable objective assessment of salivary function and provide a reproducible means for follow-up of functional impairment in certain diseases."

METHODS: the study was set up as a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. Ten patients received tranexamic acid and 9 received placebo for 12 weeks. Urinary excretion rates of hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) and lysylpyridinoline (LP) were used as molecular markers of articular cartilage and bone degradation. In addition, clinical parameters of disease activity were assessed and CRP levels were measured.
RESULTS: treatment with TEA did not reduce pyridinoline excretion, nor was any effect observed on clinical parameters of disease activity or on CRP levels.
CONCLUSION: the results of the present pilot study show no beneficial effect of TEA as adjuvant therapy in RA patients with respect to joint destruction or disease activity."

Exclusion criteria included the necessity for the primary use of constrained implants. The results revealed a highly significant difference between the two groups in favour of navigation with regard to the mechanical axis, the frontal and sagittal femoral axis and the frontal tibial axis (p < 0.0001). The use of a navigation system was therefore shown to improve the alignment of the implant."

Based on these findings, we conducted a phase I/IIa study to examine the biodistribution of DW-166HC and to assess the safety of DW-166HC for the treatment of knee synovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 16 patients [1 man, 15 women; median age 49 (range 36-65) years] who had RA knee synovitis refractory to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug treatments of > 3 months' duration were randomly assigned to three treatment groups with different radiation doses of DW-166HC: 370 MBq (n = 6), 555 MBq (n = 5) and 740 MBq (n = 5). In each treatment group, blood and urine radioactivity were analysed by beta counter and biodistribution of the injected DW-166HC was evaluated using a gamma scan camera. Clinical assessment was done according to three variables (evaluation method): knee joint pain (visual analogue scale), range of motion (goniometry) and joint swelling (circumference of knee joint). The duration of follow-up observation was 3 months. Following the intra-articular injection of DW-166HC, the blood radioactivity was little changed from the baseline measurement and the accumulated radioactivity excreted in urine was minimal. Gamma scan study indicated that most of the injected radiochemical was localized within the injected joint cavity, and the extra-articular leakage was negligible at 24 h after the injection: brain, 0.3%; lung, 0.6%; abdomen, 0.7%; and pelvis, 0.8%. Major adverse events were transient post-injection knee joint pain and swelling. These results suggest that DW-166HC might be a safe agent for radiation synovectomy, particularly for the treatment of knee synovitis of RA, and further trials in a larger patient population are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of DW-166HC."

We studied its effect on the production of two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), by peripheral blood cells in patients with JRA. Methods: Interleukin-6 and TNFalpha levels were measured at 0 and 4 weeks in whole blood cultures with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in 19 children treated with MTX (10 mg/m2 per week) or placebo. Ten healthy individuals were included as healthy controls. Results: Spontaneous production of IL-6 and TNFalpha by peripheral blood cells of patients with JRA was higher than in healthy controls (P < 0.01). However, IL-6 and TNFalpha production after LPS stimulation was similar in healthy controls and patients. The two groups of patients, i.e., those treated with placebo and those treated with MTX, had similar spontaneous and induced IL-6 and TNFalpha production. At 4 weeks, the drop in spontaneous IL-6 and TNFalpha production was no different in the two groups, but LPS-stimulated IL-6 production was significantly lower in the MTX-treated group than the placebo group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Methotrexate reduces the production of IL-6 by activated cells, and this may be responsible for its anti-inflammatory property."

Over a four-year period, 211 patients underwent total knee replacement by the senior author (TJW). They were randomised at surgery to have the PCL either retained, excised or substituted with a posterior stabilised insert. If it was not possible to retain the ligament due to soft-tissue imbalance, it was released from its tibial insertion until suitable tension was obtained. This created a fourth group, those who were intended preoperatively to have the ligament retained, but in whom it was partially released as a result of findings at the time of surgery. All patients were evaluated using the Knee Society rating system (adapted from Insall). A total of 188 patients (212 knees) was available for follow-up at a mean of 3.5 years after surgery. Preoperatively, there was a varus deformity in 191 knees (90%) and a valgus deformity in 21 (10%). There were no statistical differences in the knee or function scores or the range of movement between the excised, retained and substituted groups. There were, however, significantly worse knee and function scores in the group in whom the PCL was released (p = 0.002)."

DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: RA patients were randomized to receive either daily liquid nutrient supplementation or placebo for 4 months. The primary end point was the change in tender joint count at 2 and 4 months. Other clinical variables included swollen joint count, visual analogue scales for pain and disease activity, grip strength, functionality score and morning stiffness. Biochemical parameters included plasma concentrations of PUFA and vitamins C and E.
SETTING: Outpatient university clinic.
RESULTS: In all, 66 patients enrolled, 55 completed the study. No significant change from baseline in tender joint count or any of the other clinical parameters was detected in either group. Patients receiving nutrient supplementation, but not those receiving placebo, had significant increases in plasma concentrations of vitamin E (P=0.015), and EPA, DHA and docosapentaenoic acid concomitant with decreases of arachidonic acid (P=0.01). Intergroup differences for PUFA and vitamin E were significantly different (P=0.01 and 0.03, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study in RA patients did not show superior clinical benefit of daily nutrient supplementation with EPA, GLA and micronutrients at the doses tested as compared to placebo. The study adds information regarding doses of omega-3 fatty acids, below which anti-inflammatory effects in RA are not seen."

The aim of our study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of the D-hormone analog alfacalcidol with plain vitamin D in patients with established GIOP with or without vertebral fractures. Patients on long-term glucocorticoid (GC) therapy were included as matched pairs to receive randomly either 1 microg alfacalcidol plus 500 mg calcium per day (group A, n=103) or 1000 IU vitamin D3 plus 500 mg calcium (group B, n=101). The two groups were well matched in terms of mean age, sex ratio, mean height and weight, daily dosage, and duration of GC therapy, and the percentages of the three underlying diseases included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The baseline mean bone mineral density (BMD) values at the lumbar spine for the two groups were -3.26 (alfacalcidol) and -3.25 (vitamin D(3)) and, at the femoral neck, -2.81 and -2.84, respectively (T scores). Rates of prevalent vertebral and nonvertebral fractures did not differ between groups. During the 3-year study, we observed a median percentage increase of BMD at the lumbar spine of 2.4% in group A and a loss of 0.8% in group B ( P<0.0001). There also was a larger median increase at the femoral neck in group A (1.2%) than in group B (0.8%) ( P<0.006). The 3-year rates of patients with at least one new vertebral fracture were 9.7% among those assigned to the alfacalcidol group and 24.8% in the vitamin D group (risk reduction 0.61, 95% CI 0.24-0.81, P=0.005). The 3-year rates of patients with at least one new nonvertebral fracture were 15% in the alfacalcidol group and 25% in the vitamin D group (risk reduction 0.41, 95% CI 0.06-0.68, P=0.081). The 3-year rates of patients with at least one new fracture of any kind were 19.4% among those treated with alfacalcidol and 40.65% with vitamin D (risk reduction 0.52, 95% CI 0.25-0.71, P=0.001). In accordance with the observed fracture rates, the alfacalcidol group showed a substantially larger decrease in back pain than the plain vitamin D group ( P<0.0001). Generally, side effects in both groups were mild, and only three patients in the alfacalcidol group and two in the vitamin D group had moderate hypercalcemia. We conclude that alfacalcidol plus calcium is highly superior to plain vitamin D3 plus calcium in the treatment of established GIOP."

METHODS: forty-five patients suffering from RA were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, controlled study. Twenty-two were treated with true mud compresses (treatment group) and 23 were treated with attenuated mud compresses (control group). The compresses were applied in the patients' homes five times a week during a 3-week period. Patients were assessed four times: at baseline, upon completion of the 3-week treatment period, 1 month after the treatment, and 3 months after conclusion of the treatment period. Positive response was defined as reductions of 30% or more in the number of tender and swollen joints, 20% or more in physician global assessment of disease activity, and 20% or more in patient global assessment of the severity of joint pain.
RESULTS: in the treatment group, significant reductions in the number of swollen and tender joints and patients' global assessments of pain severity was observed at all post-treatment assessments. Significant improvement in the scores of physician global assessment was seen at the end of therapy and 1 month later. In the control group, no improvement in the number of swollen and tender joints or physician global assessment was found in any post-treatment evaluation. However, a significant reduction in patient global assessment of joint pain severity was reported at the end of therapy and 3 months after concluding treatment.
CONCLUSION: treatment with mud compresses relieves pain affecting the hands and reduces the number of swollen and tender joints in the hands of patients suffering from RA. This treatment can augment conventional medical therapy in these patients."

Design and methods: This randomised, prospective clinical trial included a total of 461 subjects (313 females and 148 males) with clinically diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. Their average age was 46.9 + 14.4 years (range 20-69 years), and the average disease duration was 1333.7 + 992.85 days. Subjects were randomly assigned daily administration of one of the following: diclofenac 75-100mg, meloxicam 15mg, nabumetone 1000mg or celecoxib 200mg. During the 6-month treatment period, a monthly patient interview was conducted to evaluate drug efficacy and safety. Results: 407 subjects successfully completed the 6-month treatment. Sixteen patients (12.2%) withdrew from the diclofenac group, 16 (12.2%) from the nabumetone group, 17 (11.8%) from the meloxicam group and five (9.1%) from the celecoxib group. Most withdrawals occurred during the first 3 months of treatment. Reasons for withdrawals in the first three groups were lack of efficacy (44.9%) and adverse effects (38.8%). For the celecoxib group, high cost (80%) was the main reason for withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions to NSAIDs mostly occurred at an early stage of treatment, with an incidence rate of 31.9% for the diclofenac group, 19.9% for the nabumetone group, 25.2% for the meloxicam group, and 7.27% for the celecoxib group. Clinical efficacy rates for the four NSAIDs were positively related to the length of treatment. During the first 4 months, diclofenac, meloxicam and celecoxib showed better efficacy than nabumetone. There were no significant differences in efficacy during the fifth and sixth months. The overall 6-month effectiveness rates were 68.8% for diclofenac, 59. 8% for nabumetone, 67.6% for meloxicam and 69.1% for celecoxib. Conclusions: Adverse drug reactions and their related withdrawals occurred mostly at an early stage of NSAID treatment, so it is crucial to strengthen pharmacovigilance during this period. Among the investigated NSAIDs, celecoxib did not prove to be superior to diclofenac, nabumetone or meloxicam with respect to its efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; however, it did show good patient compliance and safety profiles."

Over the past few years, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2)-selective inhibitors have been proved to have certain advantages over non-selective NSAIDs and have been increasingly used for pain management in patients with OA. Objective: The main objective of this randomised, double-blind, within-patient study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of three COX-2 inhibitors in 30 patients affected by symptomatic OA of the knee. We evaluated the effects of oral nimesulide (100 mg), celecoxib (200 mg) and rofecoxib (25 mg). Each drug was administered for 7 days. Methods: Analgesic efficacy was determined using the patient's assessment of pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and by total pain relief over 3 hours (TOPAR3) on the first and last days of treatment. In addition, the overall analgesic efficacy and tolerability were determined by a global assessment by the end of each week of treatment, using 5-point categorical scales. At the end of the study, each patient was asked about which of the three forms of treatment they would choose as a continuation of the pain therapy. Results: Taking all the results into consideration, nimesulide proved to be significantly more effective in providing symptomatic relief than did celecoxibe and rofecoxib. Furthermore, nimesulide provided more rapid relief of pain associated with walking than did the other two drugs tested. Patients expressed similar preference for nimesulide and rofecoxib, but a lesser preference for celecoxib treatment. No patient withdrew from the study because of adverse events and the different forms of treatment were generally safe and well tolerated. Conclusion: The present data confirm our previous observations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, further suggesting that nimesulide represents an effective agent for the treatment of joint pain, with particular reference to the rapid onset of its analgesic effect."

Bathing of radon spring was performed in the treatment group once a day, 30 minutes per time for 10 days as a course; while patients in the control group were treated with orally taken naproxen 0.25 g and poly-glycoside of common threewingnut root 10 mg, three times a day for 10 days as a course. The recent curative effects were compared between the two groups after a course. The serum immune indexes of another 38 healthy controls(group A), who came from the area where the radon spring located in and often took bathing of radon spring, and 40 healthy controls (group B), who did not took the bathing were compared, and the related internal mechanism for treating RA was analyzed. Results: The total effective rate in the treatment group (93%) was significantly superior to that in the control group (63%) (t = 102.1, P < 0.01). In comparison of the serum immune indexes, the IgG level of the subjects in group A[(13.28 + 3.56) g/L] was significantly lower than that in group B [(14.64 + 5.41) g/L] (t = 2.353, P < 0.05), while the level of complement C4(0.51 + 0.15) g/L] was significantly higher than that in the control group[(0.29 + 0.16) g/L] (t = 8.84, P < 0.01) . There was insignificance in the levels of IgA, IgM and complement C3 between the treatment and control groups. Conclution: Radon spring has better effect in treating RA, it can obviously affect the immunological function of body selectively, which is good for the rehabilitation of RA."

METHODS: In all, 20 SS patients with epithelial corneal defects, were randomly divided into two groups: group 1 (10 females, age 35-63 years), treated with 0.1% indomethacin, one drop three times a day; group 2 (nine females, one male, age 38-65 years) treated with 0.1% diclofenac, at the same regimen. No systemic NSAIDs were allowed. Use of tear substitute was allowed. Corneal sensitivity, corneal staining, BUT, and ocular discomfort, were evaluated before and after 15, 30 days of treatment and 7 days after NSAID discontinuation. For statistical analysis, the Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used.
RESULTS: Both groups showed at day 30 a statistically significant reduction of corneal sensitivity (P<0.05), although the diclofenac-treated group showed a statistically significant lower sensitivity if compared to the indomethacin-treated group (P<0.05). Corneal fluorescein score showed a statistically significantly worst alteration in group 2, 7 days after the discontinuation of the therapy (P=0.02). The ocular discomfort score was statistically significantly reduced in both groups starting from day 15 (P<0.05).
DISCUSSION: The results indicate that NSAIDs can be useful in resolving symptoms of ocular discomfort in SS patients. However, they should be used with caution and under close monitoring, and the treatment should be promptly discontinued if corneal epithelial defects develop or worsen during treatment."

Forty-two patients with stomato-glossopyrosis were registered at the Department of Periodontology, Dental School, University P√©cs, between August 2002 and January 2003. Oral clinical examination failed to identify physical explanation for the complaint of painful or burning mouth. After complete examination (blood test included), scaling, root planning and oral hygiene instructions were given. Six patients reported decreasing mucosal pain or burning. Two patients had iron-deficiency and Sj√∂gren's syndrome was suspected and verified at another two patients. Thirty-two patients completed the benzydamine-study. They were divided into two groups. The study group (16 patients) rinsed with benzydamine containing solution, the control group (16 patients) received placebo solution for rinsing the same way for ten days. Differences were found between the two groups favouring the benzydamine containing solution. Pain reduction, mouth dryness and diminution of burning sensation were detected by means of visual analog scale (VAS). Benzydamine rinses could be effective in the management of BMS, but clinicians need to monitor patients for possible side effects in the case of long-term use."
9260114,https://www.nature.com/articles/6364228,10.1038/sj.gene.6364228,"Biological activity of the IL-1 system depends on the balance between two proinflammatory proteins (IL-1alpha and IL-1beta) and the related anti-inflammatory protein, the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). The genes for these proteins lie within 430 kb on human chromosome 2. Based on a clinical trial of human recombinant IL-1ra in rheumatoid arthritis, we tested whether IL-1 genotype might be related to the likelihood of response to anti-IL-1 therapy. A positive response was defined as a reduction of at least 50% in the number of swollen joints by week 24, following treatment with either 150 mg/day IL-1ra or placebo. The response rate to treatment, independent of genotype, was 48% (44/91). A highly significant association was found between carriage of the rarer allele at IL1A(+4845) and response to treatment (P=0.0009; OR=4.85 (1.85,12.70)). The response rate in patients carrying this allele was 63.4% compared with 26.3% in noncarriers. A weaker association was found for IL1B(+3954) (P=0.02). There was a highly significant interaction between treatment (150 mg/day or placebo) and the composite genotype across IL1A(+4845) and IL1B(+3954) (P=7.6 x 10(-5)). No associations with IL-1 genotypes were found in patients receiving placebo. Thus, a significant pharmacogenomic effect was found in the treatment of RA patients with recombinant IL-1ra."

There is an increasing interest in the usefulness of wrist magnetic resonance imaging could play in predicting WHO will benefit for various treatments. METHOD AND DESIGN: two hundred patients with mild to moderate symptoms will BE recruited over 3 1/2 years from neurological surgery, primary care, electrodiagnostic clinics. We will exclude patients with clinical or electrodiagnostic evidence of denervation or thenar muscle atrophy. We will randomly assign patients to either a well-defined conservative care protocol or surgery. The conservative care treatment will include visits with a hand therapist, exercises, a self-care booklet, work modification/ activity restriction, B6 therapy, ultrasound and possible steroid injections. The surgical care would BE left up to the surgeon (endoscopic vs. open) with usual and customary follow-up. All patients will receive a wrist MRI at baseline. Patients will BE contacted at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after randomization to complete the carpal tunnel syndrome assessment questionnaire (CTSAQ). In addition, we will compare disability (activity and work days lost) and general well being AS measured by the SF-36 version II. We will control for demographics and use psychological measures (SCL-90 somatization and depression scales) AS well AS EDS and MRI predictors of outcomes. DISCUSSION: we have designed a randomized controlled trial which will assess the effectiveness of surgery for patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. An important secondary goal is to study the ability of MRI to predict patient outcomes."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study involving 73 patients, randomized into two groups. Group 1 included patients in whom the drain was clamped for 1 h postoperatively, after which it was released and kept open for 48 h. Group 2 included patients in whom the drain was clamped and released for 10 min every 2 h for 24 h. The drain was removed at 48 h in both groups. Patient's demographic details, intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, and haemoglobin values on the preoperative and postoperative days (1, 4, 7, 14) were recorded.
RESULTS: The mean postoperative drainage in group 1 was 520.65+/-170 ml, which was significantly higher than that of group 2, 367.62+/-141.1 ml (p < 0.05, Student's t-test). The drain charting shows 65% of drainage volume occurs in the first 8 h in both groups. The study suggests a reduction in the incidence of blood transfusion in the 2-hourly groups, although it was not statistically significant. There was a difference in the haemoglobin drop between both groups, but statistically the p value was marginally above 0.05 (p = 0.086) and hence not significant.
CONCLUSION: The method of 2-hourly clamping of drain and release for 10 min significantly reduces postoperative blood loss, without any added increase of complication, after total knee arthroplasty."

RESULTS: the total effective rate was 90%, 94%, 100% in the MTX plus TGP group, and 87%, 90%, 94% in the MTX group at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment respectively, comparison of the therapeutic effect between the two groups showed insignificant difference (P > 0.05). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the level of c-reactive protein were significantly decreased in both groups, but the decrement in the MTX plus TGP group was more than those in the MTX group. CONCLUSION: MTX plus TGP treatment is characterized by quick initiating, with stable clinical efficacy, few side effects and high compliance, it is more suitable for aged RA patients."

METHODS: Sixty-nine RA patients presenting with 6-12 swollen joints were enrolled to participate in a randomized trial consisting of polyarticular injection in 6-8 swollen joints of intraarticular (IA) triamcinolone hexacetonide (IA group) or intramuscular (IM) mini-pulse therapy with triamcinolone acetonide in equivalent doses (IM group). Blind examination at baseline (T0), Weeks 1 (T1), 4 (T4), 12 (T12), and 24 (T24) postintervention included American College of Rheumatology improvement criteria ACR20%, 50% and 70%, visual analog scale for articular pain, pain on movement, joint count, range of motion, morning stiffness, quality of life (Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36), use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and oral corticosteroid, blood pressure, adverse effects, calls to the physician, and hospital visits.
RESULTS: Significantly better results were observed for IA compared to IM patients as follows: ACR20% (61.7% vs 28.5% at T1; 73.5% vs 42.8% at T4), ACR50% (29.4% vs 5.7% at T1; 44.1% vs 20% at T4), ACR70% (11.7% vs 0% at T1), patient's evaluation of disease activity, lower tender joint count, lower blood pressure, lower number of adverse effects, calls to the physician, and hospital visits (p < 0.05). Less significant adrenocorticotropic hormone reduction was observed for IA group at T4 and T12 (p < 0.05). Elbows and metacarpophalangeal joints had the best response to corticosteroid injection.

Objective: To observe the effect of 99Tc methylenediphosphonate injection on rheumatic arthritis. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: A Traditional Chinese Medicine Department of Xinqiao Hospital Affiliated to the Third Military Medical University of Chinese PLA. Participants: There were 85 patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and admitted to Xinqiao Hospital from March 2000 to December 2001. Sixty-six patients were enrolled in this trial for the manifestation of four or more of the following signs for 6 weeks: morning stiffness for at least one hour, more than 3 joints affected, symmetrical arthritis, positive rheumatoid nodules and serum rheumatoid factor, accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation and typical X-ray signs of rheumatic arthritis. Among the 66 patients, 23 were males and 43 were females with the age of 18-62 years old (mean 42, 23 years). The course varied from 2 months to 12 years. They were randomly assigned into treatment group and control group with 33 each. Methods: The patients in the treatment group received 99Tc methylenediphosphonate injection injection and oral administration of placebo while those in the control group received placebo injection and oral administration of naproxen for 12 days. The morning stiffness duration, numbers of tender joints and swollen joints, erythrocyte sedimentation, C reactive protein, rheumatoid factor and total effective rate in the two groups were recorded and compared to assess the therapeutic effect. Main outcome measures: The morning stiffness duration, numbers of tender joints and swollen joints, erythrocyte sedimentation, C reactive protein and rheumatoid factor in the two groups and adverse effect of 99Tc methylenediphosphonate injection. Results: According to intention to deal with the analysis, none of the 66 patients was lost during the trial. 1 The shortening of morning stiffness duration and the reduction in the number of tender and swollen joints in the treatment group were better than those in the control group [(70.39 + 40.32) minute, (3.27 + 2.21), (3.20 + 2.38) vs (35.82 + 24.65) minute, (3.12 + 2.08), (2.02 + 1.25)] (P < 0.01 - 0.05). 2 The changes in erythrocyte sedimentation, C reactive protein and rheumatoid factor in the two groups were similar. 3 The total effective rate (85% ) in treatment group was significantly higher than that (64%) in control group (chi2 = 4.89, P < 0.05). Conclusion: 99Tc methylenediphosphonate injection is better than naproxen in ameliorating articular swelling and tenderness as well as morning stiffness of rheumatic arthritis while the effect of 99Tc methylenediphosphonate injection on erythrocyte sedimentation, C reactive protein and rheumatoid factor was similar to that of naproxen."

METHODS: fifty osteoporotic postmenopausal women with RA, who had been treated with low-dose corticosteroids for at least 6 months, were randomized to receive alendronate 10 mg/day or sCT 200 IU/day for a period of 24 months. All patients received calcium supplementation 1,000 mg and vitamin D 400 IU daily. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter was measured annually using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Bone metabolism measurements included urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and serum osteocalcin (OC).
RESULTS: over 2 years, the lumbar spine (4.34%, P < 0.001), femoral neck (2.52%, P < 0.05), and trochanteric (1.29%, P < 0.05) BMD in the alendronate group increased significantly. The sCT treatment increased lumbar spine BMD (1.75%, P < 0.05), whereas a significant bone loss occurred at the femoral neck at month 24 (-3.76%, P < 0.01). A nonsignificant decrease in the trochanteric region was observed in the sCT group (-0.81%). The difference between the groups with respect to the femoral neck and trochanteric BMD was statistically significant ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). The decreases in urinary DPD (-21.87%, P < 0.001), serum BAP (-10.60%, P < 0.01), and OC (-19.59%, P < 0.05) values were statistically significant in the alendronate group, whereas nonsignificant decreases were observed in the sCT group (-5.77%, -1.96%, and -4.31%, respectively). A significant difference was found in the DPD and BAP levels between the two treatment groups in favor of the alendronate group at all time points ( P = 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSION: the results of this study demonstrated that alendronate treatment produced significantly greater increases in the femoral neck BMD and greater decreases in bone turnover than intranasal sCT in RA patients receiving low dose glucocorticoids."

This has raised the question whether weight reduction per se can improve RA. In order to test this hypothesis, three previously conducted diet intervention studies, comprising 95 patients with RA, were pooled. Together with age, gender, and disease duration, change during the test period in body weight, characterised dichotomously AS reduction or no reduction (dichodeltabody weight), AS well AS diet (dichotomously AS ordinary diet or test diet), were the independent variables. Dependent variables were the difference (delta) from baseline to conclusion of the study in five different disease outcome measures. Deltaesr and deltapain score were both characterised numerically and dichotomously (improvement or no improvement). Deltaacute phase response, deltaphysical function, and deltatender joint count were characterised dichotomously only. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyse associations between the independent and the disease outcome variables. RESULTS: statistically significant correlations were found between diet and three disease outcome variables i.e. Deltaacute-phase response, deltapain score, and deltaphysical function. Delta body weight was univariately only correlated to deltaacute-phase response but not significant when diet was taken into account. CONCLUSION: body weight reduction did not significantly contribute to the improvement in rheumatoid arthritis when eating lacto-vegetarian, vegan or mediterranean diets."

Morning stiffness, pain (VAS), Health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and Ritchie articular index (RAI) were evaluated and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum C-reactive protein, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels of the participants were recorded. The assessments were determined before, at the 7th and 15th days of treatment. VAS and RAI scores were significantly improved by the dynamic exercises in RA patients. There were increases on IGF-1 in dynamic exercise group, although IGF-1 levels showed a decrease in ROM exercise and control groups. Also no significant changes were observed on IGFBP-3 in three groups. Our results suggest that short-term dynamic exercise therapy increases serum IGF-1 in RA patients. The manipulation of serum IGF-1 levels by dynamic exercise therapy may indicate the beneficial effects of dynamic exercise in RA patients."

Seventy-four patients with RA and 42 controls of the same age group were tested using the Biodex Stability System (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). Anterior/posterior (AP), medial/lateral (ML), and overall (OA) indices were obtained with bilateral stance at platform stabilities of 2 and 8. Subjects were tested with ""eyes open"" at all times. At the same time, Disease Activity Score, functional disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire, (HAQ)], and Steinbrocker Functional Class (SFC) were assessed. Both the AP and OA indices in the RA group were significantly higher than in the control group for level 8. For OA index, the results were 2.7+/-0.9 in RA and 2.2+/-0.7 in the control group (p=0.006), and for AP index, the results were 2.1+/-0.7 in RA and 1.7+/-0.6 in the control group (p=0.002). Eleven patients (15.9%) and three controls (7.1%) could not complete the test at level 2. When the patients and controls who completed the test were compared, a significant difference was found only in the ML index. The results were 4.6+/-2.4 in RA and 3.8+/-1.6 in the control group (p=0.047). A positive correlation between HAQ and postural balance for all three stability indices at level 8 was detected. A positive correlation between SFC and postural balance for OA and ML at level 8 was also found. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed age and body mass index (BMI) to be the most important factors influencing postural dynamic balance at both levels in the RA group and in healthy controls. RA has a negative effect on dynamic postural stability. The functional status affects dynamic balance more than disease activity. Age and BMI were the most important factors influencing postural dynamic balance in the RA group and in healthy controls. Level 2 does not appear to be an appropriate level for evaluating postural stability in RA."

METHODS: Safety results are reported for 714 patients who received etanercept in one of 7 initial trials or a longterm extension. Efficacy results are reported for 581 patients who enrolled in the extension.
RESULTS: Of the 714 patients enrolled in the initial trials, 581 (81%) enrolled in the extension, and 388 (54%) patients are continuing to receive etanercept therapy. The longest individual treatment was 8.2 years, with 3139 total patient-years of etanercept exposure. Rates of serious adverse events (overall rate=14.8 events/100 patient-yrs), serious infections (overall rate=4.2 events/100 patient-yrs), cancer (overall rate=1.0 events/100 patient-yrs), and deaths (overall rate=0.7 events/100 patient-yrs) were stable each year, through 8 years of etanercept exposure. For 356 patients who completed 6 years of etanercept treatment, response rates were ACR20=73%, ACR50=52%, ACR70=27%, DAS28 CRP good response=52%, and DAS28 CRP remission=37% of patients. Similar responses occurred in 167 patients who completed Year 7. Doses of concomitant methotrexate or corticosteroids were reduced in many patients who maintained clinical responses.
CONCLUSION: The safety profile of etanercept was consistent over time, with rates of adverse events similar to those reported for patients with RA in general.

METHODS: The SDAI is an unweighted numerical sum of five outcome parameters: tender and swollen joint count (based on 28-joint assessment), patient and physician global assessment of disease activity (visual analogue scale: 0-10 cm) and level of C-reactive protein (mg/dl). 80 patients (F/M 68/12; age between 20-68 years, median 52) with active rheumatoid arthritis were prospectively enrolled in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups according to the therapeutic regimens: group I: Methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg/weekly + salazopyrin 2 g/daily; group II: MTX 15 mg/weekly + infliximab 3 mg/Kg at time 0, 2, 4 and every 8 weeks; group III: MTX 15 mg/weekly + etanercept 25 mg/twice weekly; group IV: MTX 15 mg/weekly + adalimumab 40 mg/every other week. SDAI and DAS28 were determined at baseline and after 6 months in each patient. Mean changes in SDAI values were compared to those detected in DAS 28 at baseline and after 6 months.
RESULTS: SDAI and DAS 28 were found to be significantly correlated at baseline. Moreover, changes in SDAI over time paralleled those in DAS, and were found to be significantly correlated.

Load distribution was analysed using a Fscan mat in 14 cases, and time and distance were measured in 12 of these patients using a 3D Motion system. We found excellent patient satisfaction and a significant, lasting reduction of the Foot Function Index, with no statistically significant differences between the groups. There were no significant differences in recurrence of the deformity, the need for special shoes, gait velocity, step length, plantar moment, mean pressure or the position of the centre of force under the forefoot. The cadence was higher and the stance phase shorter in the fusion group.

Whole-body cryotherapy is an extreme method administered at -110 degrees C for 2 to 3 minutes. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of cryotherapies on pain and inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: sixty patients with active seropositive RA were recruited in a randomised controlled single-blinded study to receive whole-body cryotherapy at -110 degrees C, whole-body cryotherapy at -60 degrees C, application of local cold air at -30 degrees C and the use of cold packs locally. In the final analysis, the last 2 groups were pooled. The patients had 2-3 cryotherapy sessions daily for one week plus conventional physiotherapy. Clinical and laboratory variables and patient's and physician's global assessments were used to assess the outcome. Disease activity was calculated by DAS.
RESULTS: pain decreased in all treatment groups, most markedly in the whole-body cryotherapy (-110 degrees C) group. DAS decreased slightly with no statistically significant differences between the groups. No serious or permanent adverse effects were detected. Six of 40 patients (15%) discontinued the whole-body cryotherapy.
CONCLUSION: pain seemed to decrease more in patients in the whole-body cryotherapy at -110 degrees C than during other cryotherapies, but there were no significant differences in the disease activity between the groups. However, cryotherapy at -110 degrees C is expensive and available only in special centres and may have minor adverse effects. Based on our results, whole-body cryotherapy at -110 degrees C is not superior to local cryotherapy commonly used in RA patients for pain relief and as an adjunct to physiotherapy."

We randomly assigned 210 hips to one of the two treatment groups. Uncemented, press-fit acetabular components were used for both. No significant difference was found in the mean diameter of acetabular implant inserted in the groups (54.74 mm for total hip replacement and 54.90 mm for resurfacing arthroplasty). In seven resurfacing procedures (6.8%), the surgeon used a larger size of component in order to match the corresponding diameter of the femoral component. With resurfacing arthroplasty, conservation of bone is clearly advantageous on the femoral side. Our study has shown that, with a specific design of acetabular implant and by following a careful surgical technique, removal of bone on the acetabular side is comparable with that of total hip replacement."

Due to strong feedback regulation, plain vitamin D is not activated in the kidney in vitamin-replete patients, while alfacalcidol, having been hydroxylated at position 1, bypasses regulation and increases available amounts of active D-hormone in different target tissues. Nevertheless, a majority of physicians still prescribe plain vitamin D plus calcium as a first-step prevention or even as therapy for glucocorticoid (GC) induced osteoporosis. This article summarizes results of our previous study comparing the therapeutic efficacy of the D-hormone analog alfacalcidol to plain vitamin D in patients with established GC induced osteoporosis with or without vertebral fracture. Patients taking longterm GC therapy were included as well-matched pairs to receive randomly either 1 mug alfacalcidol plus 500 mg calcium per day (group A, n = 103) or 1000 IU vitamin D3 plus 500 mg calcium (group B, n = 101). The mean bone mineral density (BMD) values at baseline for the 2 groups for alfacalcidol and vitamin D3, respectively, were: lumbar spine T score -3.26 and -3.25; femoral neck -2.81 and -2.84. Rates of prevalent vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were not different between groups. In the 3 year study we observed in the alfacalcidol group as compared with the plain vitamin D group, respectively: a 3 year median percentage increase of BMD at the lumbar spine of 2.4% versus-0.8% (p < 0.0001); a median increase at the femoral neck of 1.2% versus 0.8% (p < 0.006). Likewise observed in the alfacalcidol as compared to the vitamin D group, respectively: a 3 year rate of patients with >1 new vertebral fracture of 9.7% versus 24.8% (risk reduction: 0.61; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.81; p = 0.005); a 3 year rate of patients with >1 new nonvertebral fracture of 15% versus 25% (risk reduction: 0.41; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.68; p = 0.081); a 3 year rate of patients with >1 new fracture of any kind of 19.4% versus 40.6%> (risk reduction: 0.52; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.71; p = 0.001). In accordance with the observed fracture rates, the alfacalcidol group showed a substantially larger decrease in back pain than the plain vitamin D group (p < 0.0001). Generally, side effects in both groups were mild, and only 3 patients in the alfacalcidol group and 2 patients in the vitamin D group had moderate hypercalcemia. We conclude that alfacalcidol plus calcium is highly superior to plain vitamin D3 plus calcium in the treatment of established GC induced osteoporosis, and the latter should no longer be used as monotherapy."

Povidone-iodine solution can be used to disinfect surgical wounds. Although povidone-iodine is a good broad-spectrum disinfecting agent, it has occasionally been reported to have a negative effect on wound healing and bone union. Therefore, its safety in a spinal surgery is unclear. A prospective, single-blinded, randomized study was accordingly conducted to evaluate the safety of povidone-iodine solution in spinal surgeries. Ascertained herein was the effect of wound irrigation with diluted povidone-iodine solution on wound healing, infection rate, fusion status and clinical outcome of spinal surgeries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: from January 2002 to August 2003, 244 consecutive cases undergoing primary instrumented lumbosacral posterolateral fusion due to degenerative spinal disorder with segmental instability had been collected and randomly divided into two groups: the study group (120 cases, 212 fusion levels) and the control group (124 cases, 223 fusion levels). Excluded were those patients with a prior spinal surgery, spinal trauma, malignant tumor, infectious spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, metabolic bone disease, skeletal immaturity or with an immunosuppressive treatment. In the former group, wounds were irrigated with 0.35% povidone-iodine solution followed by normal saline solution just before the bone-grafting and instrumentation procedure. However, only with normal saline solution in the latter. All the operations were done by the same surgeon with a standard technique. All the patients were treated in the same postoperative fashion as well. Later on, wound healing, infection rate, spinal bone fusion and clinical outcome were evaluated in both groups.
RESULTS: a significant improvement of back and leg pain scores, modified Japanese Orthopedic Association function scores (JOA) and ambulatory capacity have been observed in both groups. One hundred and seven patients in the study group and one hundred and nine in the control group achieved solid union. There was no infection in the study group but six deep infections in the control group. Wound dehiscence was noted in one group 1 and two group 2 patients. A subsequent statistical analysis revealed higher infection rate in the control group (P<0.05), but no significant difference in fusion rate, wound healing, improvement of pain score, function score and ambulatory capacity between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: diluted povidone-iodine solution can be used safely in spinal surgeries, and it will not influence wound healing, bone union and clinical outcome."

METHODS: fourty-three patients with RA, 29F/14 M, were included in a randomized, controlled trial and assigned to a control group receiving conventional pharmacological treatment only (n=21), or an intervention group receiving therapeutic education added to conventional pharmacological treatment (n=22). The main outcome variable was self-reported disability on the Stanford health assessment questionnaire (HAQ).
RESULTS: at 18 months, patients in the intervention group had less disability (HAQ), pain intensity, number of tender and swollen joints, and patient's and physician's global assessments (p=0.003, 0.031, 0.003, 0.001, 0.014, and 0.004, respectively) compared with baseline, and improvements in disability and number of tender and swollen joints (p=0.024, 0.040, and 0.003, respectively), compared with controls.

A significantly greater percentage of patients treated with 1,000 mg ornidazole met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieved an ACR20 response) at 3 months compared with patients who received placebo (62.0 vs. 32.4%; P < 0.001). Greater percentages of patients treated with 1,000 mg ornidazole also achieved ACR50 responses (38.3 vs. 10.9%; P < 0.001) and ACR70 responses (19.6 vs. 1.2%; P < 0.001) compared with patients who received placebo. Ornidazole treatment was also associated with significant reductions in pain and duration of morning stiffness, significant improvement in the quality of life and both the physician's and patient's global assessments, and significant reductions in disease activity as assessed by objective laboratory measures (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level). Ornidazole was well tolerated. There were no dose-limiting toxic effects. In this 3-month-trial ornidazole was safe, well tolerated, and associated with improvement in the inflammatory symptoms of RA."

We measured flow-mediated (FMD) and GTN-mediated dilation of the brachial artery before and following 36 weeks of anti-TNFalpha therapy in nine RA patients and in a group of RA patients on conventional therapy. Thirty-six weeks of anti-TNFalpha therapy improved FMD relative to those on conventional therapy (8.65 +/- 1.50 vs. 1.70 +/- 1.36%, P = 0.02). No significant changes in GTN responses were evident. Significant improvements in tender (P = 0.03) and swollen (P = 0.02) joint counts, patients' global self-assessment (P = 0.01) and DAS-28 scores (P = 0.04) were observed in the anti-TNFalpha treated group.

METHODS: 31 RA subjects [(M/F=5/26; mean age= 56 (range=28-73) years; mean disease duration= 165 (range =15-432) months], treated with anti- TNF-alpha drugs, were allocated to OT (n=15) or control (n=16) group. We evaluated at entry and 12 weeks the following outcome parameters including Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Global Health (GH), Ritchie index, number of swollen or tender joints, pain, patient and physician disease activity, Disease Activity Score (DAS28), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein CRP) and the correct adherence to items regarding activity daily living (ADL).
RESULTS: At baseline, OT and control group had similar demographic and clinical features. After 12 weeks, the changes from baseline of main outcome parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. After 12 weeks, in 7 out of 11 items regarding ADL, the percentage of patients showing a correct adherence was significantly increased in OT group only. Moreover at the end of the study, the OT group showed a correct adherence to 8 out of 11 ADL items in an higher percentage of patients respect to the control group.
CONCLUSION: Our study sustains that OT improves self-management but not main parameters of disease activity or functional capacity. Nevertheless educational intervention should be considered as a useful tool in conjunction with pharmacological treatment."

Depressive symptoms are not unexpected, and potentially dangerous psychiatric adverse effects can induce life-threatening conditions. We compared the incidence of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic hepatitis C during treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha-2a (IFNalpha-2a) and pegylated interferon-alpha-2b (IFNalpha-2b).
PATIENTS AND DESIGN: We randomly divided 186 subjects with chronic hepatitis C into two treatment groups: group A, treated with IFNalpha-2a, and group B, treated with IFNalpha-2b. Treatment was continued for up to 48 weeks. Liver biopsy and hepatitis C virus RNA assay were carried out in all patients. Depressive symptoms and the prevalence of psychiatric adverse effects during treatment with IFN were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistic Manual-IV axis disorders.
RESULTS: At baseline 53% of subjects in group A and 57% of subjects in group B presented with depressive symptoms; at 12 weeks we found a high incidence of depressive symptoms in both groups (group A 61% and group B 65%) and three cases of life-threatening psychiatric symptoms (i.e. psychosis and delirium requiring discontinuation of antiviral therapy and admission to a psychiatric unit) in group A.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term administration of IFN can be associated with serious psychiatric adverse effects. It is very important that psychiatric symptoms are diagnosed early in IFN treatment so to improve treatment compliance and prevent fatal and/or life-threatening adverse events, as were documented in some subjects treated with IFNalpha-2a in our study."

There were 51 patients who were randomised into two treatment groups. There were 10 subsequent withdrawals, leaving 21 all-polyethylene and 20 metal-backed tibial implants. No patient was lost to follow-up. There were no significant demographic differences between the groups. At two years one metal-backed implant showed migration > 1 mm, but no polyethylene implant reached this level. There was a significant increase in the SF-12 and Oxford knee scores after operation in both groups. In an uncomplicated primary total knee replacement the all-polyethylene PFC-Sigma tibial prosthesis showed no statistical difference in migration from that of the metal-backed counterpart. There was no difference in the clinical results as assessed by the SF-12, the Oxford knee score, alignment or range of movement at 24 months, although these assessment measures were not statistically powered in this study."

The best dose of IFN-alpha in the treatment of CML still remains controversial. Our primary objective was to compare cytogenetic responses in patients treated with intermediate versus high doses of IFN-alpha. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 109 patients with untreated CML in chronic phase from 26 Spanish hospitals. Patients were assigned to receive either an intermediate (2.5 MU/m(2) per day) or high (5 MU/m(2) per day) target dose of IFN-alpha. Hydroxyurea was allowed in both groups. In total, 108 patients were analyzed, 53 in the intermediate- and 55 in the high-dose group. Median follow-up was 47.5 months. The dose of IFN-alpha actually given was lower in the intermediate-dose group (3.83 MU/day) than in the high-dose group (6.6 MU/day) ( p<0.001). The rate of complete cytogenetic response was 24.5% in the intermediate- and 12.7% in the high-dose group (NS). A partial cytogenetic response was obtained in 7.5% and 10.9%, respectively. Cox analysis did not reveal any influence of the randomization arm on cytogenetic response rate. Ten patients in each group discontinued IFN-alpha because of toxicity. Albeit not our primary objective, no differences were found in terms of survival or transformation rate between both groups. Median survival was 73 months; 64% of patients remained free of transformation at 5 years. In terms of cytogenetic response, intermediate doses of IFN-alpha are as effective as high doses in the treatment of CML."

Thus, a possible strategy for treating inflammatory diseases is inhibition of leukocyte infiltration by antagonising CCR1. Recently, CP-481,715 has been described as a potent and specific antagonist of CCR1. The aims of this study were to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CP-481,715 along with drug interactions with ciclosporin.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a phase I randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with CP-481,715 in 78 healthy male volunteers. Subjects were administered escalating CP-481,715 doses of up to 3000 mg with food and after fasting in the single-dose study. In the drug interaction study, which was a single-dose, two-way crossover study, 12 subjects received a 300 mg dose of CP-481,715 as a suspension of polymorph A under fasted conditions, both with and without prior administration of ciclosporin.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: All doses of CP-481,715 were well tolerated, with linear pharmacokinetics up to the 300 mg dose. The pharmacodynamic activity of CP-481,715 was detected ex vivo by demonstrating a dose-related and linear increase in the amount of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, CCL3, required to induce CD11b upregulation. Analysis of vital signs indicated no consistent clinical effects, and statistical analysis of ECG characteristics demonstrated no significant prolongation of the corrected QT interval. A drug-drug interaction study with ciclosporin demonstrated that CP-481,715 clearance was decreased by ciclosporin, consistent with its ability to compete with P-glycoprotein. Phase II studies may be warranted to see if CP-481,715 exhibits efficacy in treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or transplant rejection."

Bisphosphonate, vitamin D(3) (VD(3)) or vitamin K(2) (VK(2)) is recommended as first or second choice of drug for treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. In the present study, the treatment effect of risedronate against glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritic patients was compared with that of alfacalcidol. Twelve patients were randomized to receive either risedronate (2.5 mg) or alfacalcidol (0.5 microg) daily for 48 weeks. Each patient also received 800 mg of calcium supplementation (800 mg/day) daily. Bone mineral density (BMD) and the biochemical markers of bone turnover were measured before (baseline) and 12, 24, and 48 weeks after treatment with risedronate or alfacalcidol, and the percentage changes in these parameters from baseline were compared. The BMD values 12, 24 and 48 weeks after treatment with risedronate increased by 3.9%, 4.1% and 5.2%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those after treatment with alfacalcidol (2.8%, 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively). Urinary excretion of N-telopeptides of type I collagen and deoxypyridinoline after risedronate treatment were more significantly decreased than that after alfacalcidol treatment.

Production of IgM-RF by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro and plasma levels of IgM-RF were measured by ELISA. Overall, 31 of 44 patients completing more than 6 months treatment improved including 10 treated with gold, 12 with MTX and 9 with both. Production of IgM-RF by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was decreased by 59% in patients who improved on treatment, but increased 2-fold in the unimproved group. Plasma levels of IgM-RF were decreased from 121 to 66 micrograms/ml in the improved group after 6 months of treatment, with similar decreases seen for each of the three treatments. In contrast, plasma IgM-RF levels in the unimproved group did not decrease until 1 year of treatment was completed. Nine patients converted to seronegativity, and all but one of these were in the improved group. The results suggest that IgM-RF is correlated with responses to second-line drug in RA patients."

The moderating role of socio-demographic, psychological, and physical characteristics in the process of behavior change was also investigated. Methods: Participants were 113 older adult women (n = 102) and men (n = 11) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were randomly assigned to experimental (n = 68) or wait list control (n = 45) groups. Participants were interviewed using standardized questionnaires at baseline, pre-intervention, and post-intervention. Results: Adjusted multilevel modeling analyses indicated that from pre to post intervention, experimental participants significantly increased their weekly frequency of exercise and relaxation activities.

Randomisation of 60 total hip replacements (57 patients) into two groups of 30 was undertaken. All the patients were operated on using a cemented Charnley total hip replacement, the only difference between groups being the bone cement used to secure the femoral component. The two cements used were Palamed G and Palacos R with gentamicin. The patients were followed up with repeated clinical and radiostereometric examinations for two years to assess the micromovement of the femoral component and the clinical outcome. The mean subsidence was 0.18 mm and 0.21 mm, and the mean internal rotation was 1.7degree and 2.0degree at two years for the Palamed G and Palacos R with gentamicin bone cements, respectively. We found no statistically significant differences between the groups. Micromovement occurred between the femoral component and the cement, while the cement mantle was stable inside the bone. The Harris hip score improved from a mean of 38 points (14 to 54) and 36 (10 to 57) pre-operatively to a mean of 92 (77 to 100) and 91 (63 to 100) at two years in the Palamed G and Palacos R groups, respectively. No differences were found between the groups. Both bone cements provided good initial fixation of the femoral component and good clinical results at two years.  2006 British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery."

Selective COX-2 inhibitors or coxibs were primarily developed as a response to the gastrointestinal toxicity of conventional NSAIDs but may have other side effects. Currently available data suggests definite prothrombotic risk with the coxibs, and the magnitude of risk may vary with individual agents. Based on available data, coxibs should be restricted to use as 2nd-line, possibly as 3rd-line, agents for carefully chosen patients and randomized trials versus placebo or an accepted comparator must be performed to define the overall safety profile in diverse patient populations. The recently announced Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs. Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial will assess the relative cardiovascular safety of three of the most commonly used pain relievers in the treatment of arthritis patients, ibuprofen, naproxen and celecoxib. The study will enroll patients with osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, who have known coronary heart disease or who have multiple risk factors for heart disease and also some patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients will be followed for an average of two years to track the occurrence of serious cardiovascular events, including death, heart attack and stroke. This study should provide some definitive evidence of the relative cardiovascular safety of the available anti-inflammatory agents but would be even more useful if it included an arm where patients were treated with analgesics such as acetaminophen and/or moderate strength narcotics.  2006 Schattauer GmbH, Stuttgart."

Bisphosphonates are most commonly used in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In a large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that was performed to assess the prophylactic efficacy of bisphosphonates, alendronic acid decreased the incidence of vertebral fractures by approximately 50% compared with placebo in postmenopausal patients. A similar result has also been reported with risedronic acid. The present long-term retrospective study evaluated the effects of alendronic acid and risedronic acid therapy on development of new vertebral/non-vertebral fractures in RA patients receiving long-term oral prednisolone therapy at an average dose of 5 mg/day.
METHODS: The subjects were 138 general practice patients aged 50-79 years with RA (alendronic acid group 80; risedronic acid group 58) who received oral prednisolone at a dose of 2-15 mg/day for at least 1 year combined with bisphosphonate therapy (alendronic acid 5 mg/day or risedronic acid 2.5 mg/day) for at least 10 months. Patients with five or more vertebral fractures at the start of bisphosphonate therapy were excluded from the study. Vertebral fractures were detected by obtaining plain x-ray films of the thoracic and lumbar spines at the start of bisphosphonate therapy and on completion of follow-up. We measured the incidence of new fractures, the speed of sound (SOS) at the calcaneus as measured by quantitative ultrasound, and levels of crosslinked N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX), a marker of bone resorption. The percentage change at each measuring point was tested using the paired t-test. The incidence of new fractures was compared between groups using the Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: The incidence of new vertebral fractures was 6.3% in the alendronic acid group and 13.8% in the risedronic acid group; the incidence of new non-vertebral fractures was 6.3% and 12.1%, respectively. The incidence of any fracture was significantly higher and severe fractures tended to be more common in the risedronic acid group. Analysis by the Cox proportional hazard model revealed a significant difference between the two groups with respect to the cumulative incidence of new fractures (p = 0.0386). The SOS of the calcaneus showed no appreciable difference between the two groups. NTX measurements indicated that antiresorptive activity was maintained from 6 months of treatment onwards in the alendronic acid group but not in the risedronic acid group.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that alendronic acid has a stronger prophylactic effect against fractures than risedronic acid in RA general practice patients taking long-term corticosteroid therapy."

METHODS: Subjects comprised 79 patients with RA who were receiving prednisolone, divided into 3 groups: Group K, Vit K2 alone; Group KE, Vit K2 plus etidronate; and Group KR, Vit K2 plus risedronate. During a 24-month treatment and followup period, levels of N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) and bone alkaline phosphatase were measured. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the 3 groups was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Damage score to fingers on radiographic findings were measured according to the Larsen method. Serum levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were measured.
RESULTS: Falls in rate of change of BMD decreased after 18 months in groups KR and KE. Larsen damage scores indicated a significant difference between Group KE and other groups. Significant decreases in serum NTx were observed in groups KE and KR at all timepoints, but not in Group K. Levels of RANKL decreased significantly in all 3 groups.
CONCLUSION: Vit K2 alone or in combination with bisphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis in patients with RA may inhibit osteoclast induction via decreases in levels of RANKL."

Forty RA patients with active disease despite stable therapy for at least the preceding 1 month were randomized to receive a standard protocol of acupuncture (AC) or superficial acupuncture at non-acupuncture points (controlAC) for 9 weeks. The primary outcome was achievement of 20% improvement according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 criteria after five and ten treatment sessions and after 1 month of follow-up. Secondary measures included Disease Assessment Scale (DAS), tender and swollen joint count, morning stiffness, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, physician global assessment of activity disease, physician and patient global assessment of treatment, and inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein). There was not significant difference between the groups regarding the number of patients that reached ACR20 at the end of the treatment (p=0.479). However, after 1 month of follow-up, there was a trend in favor of the AC group, with p=0.068. Compared with the controlAC, the AC group also demonstrated significant improvement in the patient and physician global assessment of treatment and physician global assessment of disease activity, but there was no difference on other clinical and laboratorial measures. On the other hand, only the AC patients had within group improvement on the variables DAS, HAQ, morning stiffness, patient and physician global assessment of treatment, and physician global assessment of disease activity in comparison to baseline visit. Despite the improvement of some studied variables, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients that reached ACR20 between the AC and controlAC groups. This negative result can be related to the small sample size, selection of patients, type of acupuncture protocol applied, and difficulties in establishing an innocuous and trustworthy placebo group to studies involving acupuncture."

The synovium was observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and analyzed immunohistochemically for expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), B-cell transmembrane protein, cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20), nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). H&E staining showed significant vascular proliferation in the synovium of the RA patients in the infliximab group (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical examinations showed that TNF-alpha was completely blocked in patients with effect attenuation who received infliximab (p < 0.05). IL-6 was more strongly expressed in the interstitial cells of synovium of patients who received infliximab than in the cells of patients in the control group (p < 0.05). MMP-3 was expressed on the surface of synovium, and CD20 and BrdU were strongly expressed in the infliximab group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). NFkB was expressed in both groups. VEGF was decreased in the infliximab group compared with control. These findings indicate that the expression pattern of immunohistochemical findings in synovium was changed in effect attenuation cases among RA patients treated with infliximab."

METHODS: Eighteen healthy volunteers (9 male, 9 female; average age 26.9 (SD 3.0) years; average body mass index 21.8 (SD 2.3) kg/m2 were randomized to three different treatment groups. Subjects received a single 8-mg dose of each lornoxicam formulation in a three-way crossover design on days 1, 8 and 15. Lornoxicam plasma concentrations were obtained from baseline to 24 hours using high-pressure liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUCinfinity), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax), terminal half-life (t1/2)) and mean residence time (MRT) were calculated.
RESULTS: Lornoxicam-QR was comparable with lornoxicam-ST and lornoxicam-IM regarding AUCinfinity, t1/2 and MRT. The AUCinfinity ratio (90% CI) was 1.07 (0.94, 1.20) for lornoxicam-QR/lornoxicam-ST and 1.10 (0.97, 1.24) for lornoxicam-QR/lornoxicam-IM.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A double blind trial included 55 patients with resistant RA. They received 5 intramuscular injections of anti-IF-gamma (n = 20), anti-TNF-alpha (n = 20) and placebo (15 patients). The results were assessed on the treatment day 7 and 28.
RESULTS: 16 patients withdrew because of the treatment uneffectiveness (2 from the group on anti-IF-g, 3--on anti-TNF-alpha, 11--on placebo). To the treatment day 28 the patients given anticytokines achieved significant improvement of all clinical indices while placebo group had no improvement. The highest response was observed in the group on anti-IF-gamma (ACR 70). As shown by ultrasound investigation, a significant reduction of the synovial membrane thickness took place also in administration of anti-IF-gamma. Most frequent side effect of the anticytokine therapy was mild dermatitis at injection site on treatment day 8-11.

METHODS: prospective, randomized study in patients with noninfectious uveitis after phacoemulsification and implantation of either a hydrophobic AcrySof (group 1, n = 30) or a hydrophilic Akreos adapt (group 2, n = 30), sharp-edged acrylic IOL. The primary outcome was uveal biocompatibility, detected by giant-cell deposition, anterior chamber cell count and laserflare photometry over a 6-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures were capsular biocompatibility, as detected by posterior capsule opacification (PCO), lens epithelial cell outgrowth and Nd: YAG capsulotomies, and visual outcome.
RESULTS: the groups did not differ with respect to anatomic type of uveitis, immunosuppressive treatment, associated systemic disease, and intraoperative manipulation. The number of giant cells on the anterior IOL surface was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p = 0.03). The number of anterior chamber cells, laser flare photometry levels, and uveitis reactivations after surgery did not differ between the groups. After 6 months, the number of patients with PCO development (p = 1.0) and Nd: YAG capsulotomies (p = 0.21), lens epithelial cell outgrowth, visual outcome and uveitis complications were comparable in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: both of the acrylic IOLs used had good uveal and capsular biocompatibility, leading to significant improvement in BCVA in patients with noninfectious uveitis. No obvious differences were detected at 6 months with respect to uveal and capsular biocompatibility and visual outcome."

Fifty responders were randomized to anakinra or placebo in a 16-week blinded phase, followed by a 12-month open-label extension (N = 44). Due to low enrollment, the primary endpoint was changed from efficacy to safety. The incidence and nature of adverse events were similar across all study phases, with the exception of injection site reactions, which were mild to moderate and decreased with time. Anakinra produced a nonsignificant (P = 0.11) reduction in disease flares compared with placebo. When normalized to 1 mg/kg dose, anakinra plasma concentrations were similar to values in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These results indicate that anakinra 1 mg/kg once daily (< or =100 mg/day) is safe and well tolerated in patients with JRA."

In the European Union (EU), patients who fail to respond to traditional DMARDs may receive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists. However, approximately one-third of patients fail TNF-alpha antagonists due to adverse effects or lack of efficacy, and there are limited treatment options available to these patients. As knowledge of the underlying immunopathology of RA evolves, new strategies for inhibiting the inflammatory process have emerged. It is well known that activated T cells play a key role in orchestrating the immunopathological mechanisms of RA. Inhibiting the full activation of T cells is a rational strategy in the treatment of RA and represents a novel method of inhibiting disease activity, distinct from inflammatory cytokine blockade. Here, the safety and efficacy of abatacept, a selective T-cell co-stimulation modulator recently approved in the EU, is reviewed in patients with RA who have shown an inadequate response to TNF-alpha antagonists. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trial of patients with an inadequate response to TNF-alpha antagonism, abatacept was effective in improving the signs and symptoms of RA, as well as patient-centered outcomes, such as fatigue, disability, and other mental and physical aspects of health-related quality of life. These improvements were sustained through 2 years during the open-label, long-term extension period. In this trial, abatacept demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo. Taken together, these data suggest that selective co-stimulation modulation with abatacept may be a viable option for patients who are refractory to both traditional therapies and TNF-alpha antagonists."

Dipyridamole inhibits the cellular uptake and metabolism of adenosine and we have, therefore, examined the effects of dipyridamole in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in an attempt to alleviate their symptoms. Forty patients aged 18-75 years were randomised to receive dipyridamole 400 mg/day or placebo. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at monthly intervals for 6 months. Purines were determined by HPLC and cytokines by ELISA. After 3 months of treatment there were significant reductions in neopterin levels and in the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire score, but these were not maintained. Dipyridamole had no effect on disease severity or the levels of purine metabolites, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, TNF-alpha, lipid peroxidation products, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. In conclusion, rheumatoid arthritis patients showed no clinical improvement following treatment with dipyridamole for 6 months."

Results showed that sICAM-1 levels were increased (but not significantly) in SpA patients compared with controls; high levels (> 400 ng/ml) where found in 28% of SpA patients but in none of the RA or control groups. In SpA, correlations were found between sICAM-1 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, but not with tumour necrosis factor alapha or IgA. These correlations were absent in RA. In conclusion, these results suggest that sICAM-1 levels in SpA may reflect the acute phase of inflammation."

This study highlights the interaction, in vivo, of these drugs with erythrocyte membrane in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Fifty-eight patients with definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis were included in this study and randomly allocated to three groups as 18 patients in the Myocrisin group, 20 patients in the auranofin group, and 20 patients in the placebo group. The drugs appeared to react, in vivo, in different ways. With Myocrisin, the level of gold in erythrocyte membrane was, initially, very high and decayed exponentially afterwards, whereas auranofin produced a constant high level up to 36 weeks. The erythrocyte membrane gold level in nonsmokers was higher than that in smokers in the auranofin group, and it decreased with an increase in the number of cigarettes smoked (r = 0.836 P < 0.01); no such correlation was observed in the Myocrisin group. In a changeover study, auranofin appeared to change the nature of erythrocyte membrane after reacting with it and rendering it incapable of picking up any gold from Myocrisin. In the case of auranofin, the hemolysate membrane gold level was found to correlate with clinical improvement."
9260428,,10.3899/jrheum.080073,"OBJECTIVE: to compare the efficacy and safety of celecoxib and naproxen in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).
METHODS: in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority study, subjects with JRA were randomized to receive a target dose of celecoxib 3 mg/kg bid or 6 mg/kg bid, or a target dose of naproxen 7.5 mg/kg bid for 12 weeks (maximum allowed dose=600 mg total daily dose). The primary efficacy measure was the percentage of responders at Week 12 attaining the American College of Rheumatology pediatric 30% improvement criterion (ACR Pediatric-30).
RESULTS: both celecoxib doses were at least as effective as naproxen at Week 12 [ACR Pediatric-30 treatment differences: celecoxib 3 mg/kg bid-naproxen=1.36% (95% CI -13.08 to 15.80); celecoxib 6 mg/kg bid-naproxen=13.02% (95% CI -0.22 to 26.25)]. Celecoxib 6 mg/kg bid had a numerically higher response rate than celecoxib 3 mg/kg bid at all postrandomization visits and a numerically higher response rate than naproxen 7.5 mg/kg bid at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Improvement in each ACR Pediatric-30 core set measure was comparable to or numerically higher for celecoxib 6 mg/kg bid than naproxen or celecoxib 3 mg/kg bid. Adverse event rates were similar for all treatment groups, except that gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the naproxen group, although the difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: celecoxib 3 mg/kg bid and 6 mg/kg bid were at least as effective as naproxen 7.5 mg/kg bid in treating the signs and symptoms of JRA over 12 weeks. All treatments were generally well tolerated."
9260429,,10.1136/bmj.316.7136.965,"OBJECTIVE: To test the clinical equivalence and resource consequences of day care with inpatient care for active rheumatoid arthritis.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled clinical trial with integrated cost minimisation economic evaluation.
SETTING: Rheumatic diseases unit at a teaching hospital between 1994 and 1996.
SUBJECTS: 118 consecutive patients with active rheumatoid arthritis randomised to receive either day care or inpatient care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical assessments recorded on admission, discharge, and follow up at 12 months comprised: the health assessment questionnaire, Ritchie articular index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hospital anxiety and depression scale, and Steinbrocker functional class. Resource estimates were of the direct and indirect costs relating to treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Secondary outcome measures (health utility) were ascertained by time trade off and with the quality of well being scale.
RESULTS: Both groups had improvement in scores on the health assessment questionnaire and Ritchie index and erythrocyte sedimentation rate after hospital treatment (P < 0.0001) but clinical outcome did not differ significantly between the groups either at discharge or follow up. The mean hospital cost per patient for day care, 798 Pounds (95% confidence interval 705 Pounds to 888 Pounds), was lower than for inpatient care, 1253 Pounds (1155 Pounds to 1370 Pounds), but this difference was offset by higher community, travel, and readmission costs. The difference in total cost per patient between day care and inpatient care was small (1789 Pounds (1539 Pounds to 2027 Pounds) v 2021 Pounds (1834 Pounds to 2230 Pounds)). Quantile regression analysis showed a cost difference in favour of day care up to the 50th centile (374 Pounds; 639 Pounds to 109 Pounds).
CONCLUSIONS: Day care and inpatient care for patients with uncomplicated active rheumatoid arthritis have equivalent clinical outcome with a small difference in overall resource cost in favour of day care. The choice of management strategy may depend increasingly on convenience, satisfaction, or more comprehensive health measures reflecting the preferences of patients, providers, and service commissioners."

It was an open, crossover study that involved 15 RA patients who were on stabilized treatment with CyA-ST. The patient continued receiving CyA-ST (mean dose of 3.0 +/- 0.7 mg/kg per day) for 3 weeks and then converted 1:1 to CyA-NF for a further 3 weeks. CyA pharmacokinetics were established on day 1 (CyA-ST evaluation) and +21 (CyA-NF evaluation). The results showed that the bioavailability of CyA-NF was greater than that of CyA-ST (AUC tau, bss: 3335 +/- 1300 vs 2667 +/- 1155 ng.h/ml, P = 0.0073; AUC tau, bss ratio 1.26 +/- 0.40 vs 1.0 as reference, P < 0.05), with higher and earlier peak blood concentrations (Cmax: 677 +/- 256 vs 475 +/- 213 ng/ml, P = 0.0329; tmax: 1.5 +/- 0.7 vs 2.6 +/- 1.6 h, P = 0.0720). The pharmacokinetic profile of CyA-NF showed greater between-patient reproducibility (lower CV% for all of the considered parameters). In conclusion, when using CyA-NF instead of CyA-ST, greater and more constant exposure to CyA should be expected."
9260432,,10.1007/s10067-008-0961-6,This study aimed to identify the reasons for limited results of group self-management for RA patients and their partners from the patient perspective. Semi-structured interviews with ten male and ten female patients who had participated in group self-management with or without their partner were content analyzed with respect to motivation to participate and the effects of the program on them. The limited effects of the self-management program appear to be linked with low motivation to participate and to change health behavior. The data show that a decline in health and also stressful life events might be associated with the disappointing effects of the program. Three strategies were proposed for improving the program's effects: (a) provide information about the program in advance to ensure that patients have appropriate expectations. (b) Enhance intrinsic motivation to change health behavior by counseling techniques. (c) Tailoring with respect to motivation and current concerns could help to form more homogeneous groups or could be the basis for a tailored online intervention.
9260439,,10.2165/00003495-199300451-00007,"OBJECTIVE: The fixed combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol (Arthrotec) is the only nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) that contains a gastroprotective component and is available in 2 formulations:(1) an enteric coated core of diclofenac sodium 50 mg surrounded by a mantle of misoprostol 200 microg, and (2) a 75 mg enteric coated diclofenac core also surrounded by a 200 microg mantle of misoprostol. This article reviews the European clinical experience with both formulations in patients with arthritis.
METHODS: Three randomized, blinded, multicenter studies, including one in general practice, evaluated the efficacy of combination diclofenac/misoprostol versus diclofenac or ibuprofen in a total of 1824 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA). Four additional studies assessed antiarthritic efficacy and employed endoscopy to compare the gastroduodenal safety of combined diclofenac50/misoprostol with that of diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, or indomethacin in 1459 patients with RA, OA, or ankylosing spondylitis. The gastroduodenal safety and antiarthritic efficacy of diclofenac75/misoprostol was compared with that of diclofenac in one endoscopy study involving 514 patients with RA or OA.
RESULTS: The efficacy and safety data obtained from these European clinical trials show that both formulations diclofenac50/misoprostol and diclofenac75/misoprostol are effective antiinflammatory drugs, with clinical efficacy equivalent to that of diclofenac. Diclofenac50/misoprostol is at least as effective as naproxen, piroxicam, indomethacin, and ibuprofen. Both formulations of the combination were associated with significantly fewer gastroduodenal ulcers compared with diclofenac. In separate studies, the tolerability of diclofenac50/misoprostol (as determined by withdrawal rates) was shown to be equivalent to that of diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, and ibuprofen, and the tolerability of diclofenac75/misoprostol was shown to be equivalent to that of diclofenac. The diclofenac50/misoprostol was associated with fewer decreases in hemoglobin concentration compared with diclofenac in the general practice study as well as in hospital patients.
CONCLUSION: Diclofenac50/misoprostol and diclofenac75/misoprostol are effective in treating the signs and symptoms of RA and OA and are well tolerated by the majority of patients. Both of these formulations achieve a significant reduction in the incidence of both gastric and duodenal ulcers compared with other NSAID."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An open controlled randomized trial of clinical benefit and tolerance of anticytokine antibodies was performed in a group of RA patients at stage II, III and IV (1, 20 and 4 patients, respectively). The activity degree II and III was in 10 and 15 patients, respectively. All the patients had articular functional insufficiency of the second degree. 21 patients failed previous therapy with basic drugs including immunodepressants.
RESULTS: The anticytokine antibodies proved to be highly effective in RA. Positive changes in teh disease activity were achieved early after the end of the 5-day course in 88% of patients. The most definite immediate therapeutic effect was noted in usage of TNF antibodies both in monotherapy and in combination with other anticytokines. Long-term effect was the best in patients given antibodies to interferon gamma. Interferon-alpha antibodies produced weaker effect. The combined treatment had no advantages over the monotherapy.
CONCLUSION: A significant therapeutic effect of antibodies to interferon-gamma is indicative of an important role of this cytokine in RA pathogenesis. Anticytokine antibodies are promising as a component of combined therapy of patients with resistant RA."

The visual hallucinations first appeared when she arose from sleep early on postoperative day 1, approximately 12 h after the end of surgery. Only on closing her eyes, she had a clear view of colored clothes, lace curtains, handbags, hats, and sofas, all of which were vivid, realistic, complex, of natural size, and in normal perspective without distortion and appeared independently and randomly in succession. The hallucinations disappeared when she opened her eyes even in the dark. The visual hallucinations gradually decreased as the days elapsed and they had entirely subsided on postoperative day 4. The level and content of her consciousness seemed entirely normal throughout her hospital course. Although postoperative visual hallucinations are not uncommon, they do not always show the closed-eye variation. The causes and underlying mechanisms of this type of visual hallucination remain to be elucidated. ISSN Print 0913-8668"

The aim of the study was focused to evaluate the number of infectious episodes in two groups of patients treated with etanercept (ETN) plus methotrexate (MTX) or ETN plus MTX and glucocorticoid drugs (GCs/prednisone) for a 12 months period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine out of 122 RA patients treated with an anti-TNFalpha drug (ETN) were included in an outpatient control system within the Immunology Department Sapienza-University of Rome-II; School of Medicine. RA patients were studied during the first year after ETN introduction. Particularly 20 RA patients have been included in a subgroup. For these 20 patients infections have been monitored for 2 years: 12 months before and 12 months after ETN treatment starting.
RESULTS: According to drugs administration protocols, after a careful screening aiming to exclude latent tuberculosis infection, 20 patients have been treated with ETN (10 of them received treatment in association to MTX, while 10 were given a GCs therapy plus MTX). During the one-year ETN treatment period, 7 infections have been described in the group treated with ETN, MTX and GCs and no infection in the group treated with ETN and MTX. After analysing the infection number in the two groups of patients, in the year preceding biological treatment no significant change arose.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of infections in subjects treated with the biological drug ETN is well known. Our data show that after one year therapy the [ETN+MTX+GCs] group is marked by a greater frequency of infectious episodes compared to the subjects treated with ETN plus MTX. Therefore, the additional infectious risk appears to be related to steroid therapy itself, though infections were not serious."

METHODS: Arginine residues of bovine collagen type II (CII) were converted to citrulline residues by peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD). Peripheral blood samples were collected from 34 RA patients, and 18 sex- and age-matched controls, including 6 osteoarthritis patients and 12 healthy blood donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured with Cit-CII, CII, or fetal bovine serum RPMI 1640 fluid, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), or citrullinated buffer as controls. Cellular reactivity levels against Cit-CII and CII were investigated by measuring the proliferation of PBMCs to calculate the stimulation index (SI). ELISA was used to detect the presence of antibodies against Cit-CII and CII.
RESULTS: The positive rate of T cell proliferative response to Cit-CII of the RA group was 32.4% (11/34), significantly higher than that of the control group (0, P < 0.05). The positive rate of T cell proliferative response to CII of the RA group was 35.3% (12/34), significantly higher than that of the control group (11.1%, P < 0.05). Interestingly, Cit-CII could not elicit a better T cell proliferative response than CII did. In the RA patients, the anti-Cit-CII antibody positive rate was 52.9% (18/34), significantly higher than that of the anti-CII antibody positive rate [32.4% (11/34), P < 0.05). The serum IgG anti-CII antibody positive rate of the patients with positive T cell responses to CII was 58.3% (7/12), significantly higher than that of the patients with negative T cell responses to CII [18.2% (4/22), P < 0.05]. The serum IgG anti-CII antibody positive rate of the patients with positive T cell responses to Cit-CII was 72.7% (8/11), significantly higher than that of the patients with negative T cell responses to Cit-CII [43.5% (10/23), P < 0.05].
CONCLUSION: The recognition of Cit-CII by circulating IgG antibodies is a RA-specific serological phenomenon. The formation of CII antibody in the RA patients may be related to B cell activation mediated by CII specific T cells. The role of Cit-CII in RA cellular immune need be further studied."

The goal of this work was to investigate whether the therapeutic response in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is diminished.
METHODS: in total, 192 patients admitted to hospital because of active RA were prospectively studied. The improvements in disease activity (RADAI), pain and function (FFbH) three months after release were measured and compared between two age groups.
RESULTS: patients <65 and > or =65 years of age (n=104 and 88, mean age of 52+/-10 and 72+/-5.6 years, respectively) showed comparable improvements of disease activity and pain in the complete group as well as in those who received newly administered DMARD or TNF-alpha-inhibitors (71.2% and 62.6%, respectively, for the two groups). A significant difference was demonstrated for the change in function: while patients <65 years of age in the mean had a moderate improvement of the FFbH, this could not be shown for the older patients (p=0.04). A close correlation of the improvements of RADAI and FFbH could be shown for the younger patients only.
CONCLUSIONS: DMARD or TNF-alpha-inhibitors improve disease activity and pain in elderly patients with RA no less than in younger patients. However, in contrast to the younger patients, the older patients profit less in terms of functional impairment."
9260484,,10.3899/jrheum.090013,"OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled study addressed whether sonographic needle guidance affected clinical outcomes of intraarticular (IA) joint injections.
METHODS: In total, 148 painful joints were randomized to IA triamcinolone acetonide injection by conventional palpation-guided anatomic injection or sonographic image-guided injection enhanced with a one-handed control syringe (the reciprocating device). A one-needle, 2-syringe technique was used, where the first syringe was used to introduce the needle, aspirate any effusion, and anesthetize and dilate the IA space with lidocaine. After IA placement and synovial space dilation were confirmed, a syringe exchange was performed, and corticosteroid was injected with the second syringe through the indwelling IA needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, pain at outcome (2 weeks), and changes in pain scores were measured with a 0-10 cm visual analog pain scale (VAS).
RESULTS: Relative to conventional palpation-guided methods, sonographic guidance resulted in 43.0% reduction in procedural pain (p < 0.001), 58.5% reduction in absolute pain scores at the 2 week outcome (p < 0.001), 75% reduction in significant pain (VAS pain score > or = 5 cm; p < 0.001), 25.6% increase in the responder rate (reduction in VAS score > or = 50% from baseline; p < 0.01), and 62.0% reduction in the nonresponder rate (reduction in VAS score < 50% from baseline; p < 0.01). Sonography also increased detection of effusion by 200% and volume of aspirated fluid by 337%.
CONCLUSION: Sonographic needle guidance significantly improves the performance and outcomes of outpatient IA injections in a clinically significant manner."

METHODS: Twenty-three patients (14 males, 9 females; age, 28-55 years; 26 hips) with hip disease underwent the total hip arthroplasty (THA) using the non-image based surgical navigation system from February 2004 to April 2006. Rheumatoid arthritis was found in 3 patients (3 hips), necrosis of the femoral head in 6 patients (6 hips), and osteoarthritis in 14 patients (16 hips). All the patients were randomly divided into the following 2 groups: the navigated group (11 patients, 13 hips), treated by THA using the non-image based surgical navigation system; and the control group (12 patients, 13 hips), treated by the traditional THA. According to the design of the study, the acetabular component was placed in the best inclination angle (45 degrees) and the anteversion angle (15 degrees). The postoperative component position was examined.
RESULTS: No fracture, dislocation, infection or injury to the sciatic nerve was found. In the navigated group, the inclination and the anteversion reached 15.4 +/- 1.4 degrees and 45.5 +/- 1.3 degrees, respectively. In the control group, the inclination and the anteversion were 13.9 +/- 7.6 degrees and 43.7 +/- 6.4 degrees, respectively. The inclination difference was considered statistically significant (P < 0.01). All the patients were followed up for 10-40 months,averaged 26 months. In the navigated group, the postoperative average Harris hip score was 95 (range, 85-110), with an excellent result in 11 hips and a good result in 2 hips. In the control group, the postoperative average Harris hip score was 92 (range, 75-110), with an excellent result in 9 hips, a good result in 3 hips, and a fair result in 1 hip. The Harris hip score difference was considered statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was a significantly better result obtained in the navigated group than in the control group.
CONCLUSION: The acetabular component can be implanted accurately by the non-image based surgical navigation system, which can reduce the incidence of the loosening of the prostheses and has an important value in clinical practice."

Our objective was to compare three clinical vignette-based survey response formats - open-ended questionnaire (A), closed-ended (multiple-choice) questionnaire with deceptive response items mixed with correct items (B), and closed-ended questionnaire with only correct items (C) - in rheumatologists' pre-treatment assessment for tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF) blocker therapy. METHODS: STUDY DESIGN: prospective randomized study. SETTING: rheumatologists attending the 2004 french society of rheumatology meeting. Physicians were given a vignette describing the history of a fictitious woman with active rheumatoid arthritis, WHO was a candidate for therapy with TNF blocking agents, and then were randomized to receive questionnaire A, B, or C, each containing the same four questions but with different response formats, that asked about their pretreatment assessment. MEASUREMENTS: long (recommended items) and short (mandatory items) checklists were developed for pretreatment assessment for tnf-blocker therapy, and scores were expressed on the basis of responses to questionnaires A, B, and c AS the percentage of respondents correctly choosing explicit items on these checklists. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: comparison of the selected items using pairwise chi-square tests with bonferonni correction for variables with statistically significant differences. RESULTS: data for all surveys distributed (114 as, 118 bs, and 118 cs) were complete and available for analysis. The percentage of questionnaire A, B, and c respondents for whom data was correctly complete for the short checklist was 50.4%, 84.0% and 95.0%, respectively, and was 0%, 5.0% and 5.9%, respectively, for the long version. AS an example, 65.8%, 85.7% and 95.8% of the respondents of A, B, and c questionnaires, respectively, correctly identified the need for tuberculin skin test (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: in evaluating clinical practice with use of a clinical vignette, a multiple-choice format rather than an open-ended format overestimates physician performance. The insertion of deceptive response items mixed with correct items in closed-ended (multiple-choice) questionnaire failed to avoid this overestimation."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: there were 290 consecutive patients (between 16 and 45 years) with at least 4 weeks of knee complaints and low clinical suspicion of intra-articular pathology based on physical exam. Two hundred seventy-four patients were included. Sixteen patients with prior knee surgery, rheumatic arthritis, or severe osteoarthritis were excluded. MRI was used to assign patients to group 1 (treatable abnormalities) or group 2 (normal or no treatable findings), depending on whether MR demonstrated treatable pathology. Arthroscopy was performed in group 1 patients. If symptoms persisted for 3 months in group 2 patients, cross over to arthroscopy was allowed.
RESULTS: MR showed treatable pathology in 73 patients (26.6%). Arthroscopy was performed in 64 patients of 73 patients (group 1). In 52 patients (81.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 71.4-91.1%), arthroscopy was therapeutic. Of the 13 arthroscopies (6.5%) in group 2, four were therapeutic (30.8%, 95% CI 1.7-59.8). The highest fraction of MR studies showing treatable pathology was found in males, aged over 30 years, with a history of effusion (54.5%, six of 11 patients).
CONCLUSION: authors believe that the negative predictive value of clinical assessment in patients with subacute knee complaints is too low to exclude these patients from MR. MR should at least be considered in male patients aged 30 years and over with a history of effusion."

METHODS: a randomized double-blind controlled study was conducted including 60 patients with RA. Patients were randomized to receive either a single intraarticular knee injection with triamcinolone hexacetonide 60 mg (3 ml) and xylocaine chloride 2% (1 ml) associated to a single intramuscular injection of 1 ml of xylocaine chloride 2% (IAI group) or 1 ml of xylocaine chloride 2% by intraarticular injection and a intramuscular injection of triamcinolone acetonide 60 mg (3 ml) and xylocaine chloride 2% (1 ml) (IM group). All patients were blindfolded for the procedure. Evaluations were performed at baseline and 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-intervention. The following instruments were used: VAS for knee pain, as primary outcome, VAS for knee morning stiffness and edema; the ACR 20, 50 and 70% improvement criteria; knee circumference and goniometry; Likert's scale of improvement; daily use of oral glucocorticoid and NSAIDs, blood pressure and adverse effects.
RESULTS: patients in the IAI group had significantly better results for VAS for knee pain, edema and morning stiffness as well as for improvement evaluation after intervention according to the patient (p<0.001) and physician (p=0.02).
CONCLUSION: our results demonstrate that intraarticular injection with glucocorticoids is superior to its systemic use for the management of monoarticular synovitis in rheumatoid patients. The intraarticular approach showed better results in terms of local inflammatory variables and improvement evaluation by the patient and physician."

The present clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of UC-II as compared to a combination of glucosamine and chondroitin (G+C) in the treatment of OA of the knee. The results indicate that UC-II treatment was more efficacious resulting in a significant reduction in all assessments from the baseline at 90 days; whereas, this effect was not observed in G+C treatment group. Specifically, although both treatments reduced the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, treatment with UC-II reduced the WOMAC score by 33% as compared to 14% in G+C treated group after 90 days. Similar results were obtained for visual analog scale (VAS) scores. Although both the treatments reduced the VAS score, UC-II treatment decreased VAS score by 40% after 90 days as compared to 15.4% in G+C treated group. The Lequesne's functional index was used to determine the effect of different treatments on pain during daily activities. Treatment with UC-II reduced Lequesne's functional index score by 20% as compared to 6% in G+C treated group at the end of 90-day treatment. Thus, UC-II treated subjects showed significant enhancement in daily activities suggesting an improvement in their quality of life."

METHODS: Sixty-six women with stage 2-4 uterine descent were randomized for vaginal hysterectomy(31) or sacrospinous hysteropexy(35). Recovery time, anatomical outcomes, functional outcomes, and quality of life were measured.
RESULTS: Length of time to return to work was shorter after a sacrospinous hysteropexy (43 versus 66 days, p = 0.02). The difference in risk for recurrent prolapse stage 2 or more of the apical compartment at 1-year follow-up was 17% (95% confidence interval, 2 to 30) in favor of the vaginal hysterectomy. No differences in quality of life and urogenital symptoms were found.
CONCLUSIONS: The sacrospinous hysteropexy for uterine descent is associated with an earlier recovery time, more recurrent apical prolapses but no differences in functional outcomes, and quality of life."

This study aimed to investigate the distributions of B-cells and subsets in peripheral blood of AS patients and observe their changes in etanercept-treated AS patents.
METHODS: We detected the proportions of CD19(+) B-cell, naive B-cell (CD19(+)CD27-), memory B-cell (CD19(+)CD27dim) and plasmablast (CD19(+)CD27high) in peripheral blood of 66 patients with AS (39 at active stage, 27 at stable stage; 35 patients with peripheral joint involvement, 31 patients with axial involvement alone), 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 30 healthy volunteers using flow cytometry. And then we observed the changes of the above indexes of 39 active AS patients treated with etanercept in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
RESULTS: (1) Percentages of CD19(+) B-cells in active or peripheral joint involvement AS patients increased more obviously than those in stable or axial involvement alone AS patients (both P = 0.001), and percentage of CD19(+)CD27high B-cells in AS patients with peripheral joint involvement was significantly higher than that in cases with axial involvement alone or healthy volunteers (P = 0.005 and 0.006, respectively); (2) The percentage of CD19(+) B-cells in AS patients was positively correlated with Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) scores, Patient's Global Assessment (PGA) scores, total back pain scores and nocturnal back pain scores (r = 0.270, 0.255, 0.251 and 0.266, P = 0.029, 0.039, 0.042 and 0.031, respectively); (3) At week 6 and week 12, there were no statistical differences of the percentages of B-cells and subsets between etanercept group and placebo group of AS patients (P > 0.05); the percentage of CD19(+) B-cells in etanercept group was higher than that in healthy volunteers at week 12 (t = 3.320, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Misbalance is present in B-cells and some subsets in peripheral blood of active AS patients with peripheral joint involved. B-cells might play an important role in the pathogenesis of AS patients. The high percentage of CD19(+) B-cells in active AS patients cannot be down-regulated after 12-week etanercept treatment."
9260554,,10.2334/josnusd.51.407,"Management of oral candidiasis depends on an accurate diagnosis, identification and elimination of predisposing factors, and, often, use of antifungal agents. Chronic hyperplastic candidosis (CHC) is considered a premalignant lesion of the oral mucosa, occurring as speckled or homogeneous white lesions. If the lesions are untreated, a minor proportion may become dysplastic and progress to carcinoma. The traditional treatment of this lesion is based on the use of antifungal agents. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of 0.18% isotretinoin for treatment of nystatin-resistant candidiasis. Isotretinoin was administered topically twice a day for one month to six patients affected by nystatin-resistant CHC. In all six patients, daily antimycotic topical therapy with nystatin for 30 days had failed to resolve the candidal stomatitis. After one month of isotretinoin treatment, five of the six patients were negative for Candida, whereas in untreated control patients the situation was unchanged. Only one patient with suspected sicca syndrome was found to have oral Candida 15 days after the last administration of isotretinoin. None of the patients had any complaints about the medication. These findings suggest that 0.18% isotretinoin applied twice a day for one month is able to suppress nystatin-resistant candidiasis."

Although some studies have indicated the importance of T-cells and proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of the AS, it is still unknown whether co-stimulatory molecule CD154 participates in the pathogenesis of AS and how its level changes during the anti-TNF-alpha treatment of AS. This study is performed to evaluate the expression of CD154 in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes of patients with AS and observe the change of CD154 in etanercept-treated AS patient. We collected the peripheral blood and clinical data from 66 AS, 30 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and 30 healthy controls. Thirty-nine active AS patients were enrolled in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. We followed up 37 cases that fulfilled the ASAS20 response criteria after they finished etanercept treatment till week 48. The percentage of CD3+CD154+ in peripheral blood lymphocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry. We found that CD154 expression in AS patients was significantly higher than that in healthy volunteers and RA patients (both P < 0.001). The expressions of CD154 in AS patients at active stage or with peripheral joint involvement were significantly higher than those at stable stage or with axial involvement alone (P = 0.005 and 0.044, respectively). The expression of CD154 decreased in AS patients treated with etanercept compared with patients treated with placebo at week 6 (P < 0.001). Compared with healthy volunteers, the expression of CD154 in 16 AS patients who relapsed after finishing etanercept treatment was elevated again (P = 0.012). These findings show that co-stimulatory molecule CD154 is overexpressed on T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood of AS patients and can be down-regulated by etanercept treatment, which suggest that CD154 might be involved in the inflammatory evolvement of AS and might be a potential biomarker to monitor AS disease activity and the effect of etanercept treatment."

Patients who were confused or bed-ridden were excluded, as were those with rheumatoid arthritis. At ten years there were 99 failures (45.6%) after internal fixation compared with 17 (8.8%) after replacement. The rate of mortality was high at 75% at ten years, and was the same in both groups at all times. Patient-reported pain and function were similar in both groups at five and ten years. Those with successfully healed fractures had more hip pain and reduction of mobility at four months compared with patients with an uncomplicated replacement, and they never attained a better outcome than the latter patients regarding pain or function.

We investigated the preference for and acceptability of chewable tablet containing calcium and vitamin D (Calci Chew D(3), Nycomed) compared to that of a sachet containing calcium and vitamin D(3) (Cad, Will-Pharma). This open, randomised, cross-over trial was set up to compare the preference and acceptability of two calcium plus vitamin D(3) formulations (both with 500 mg calcium and 400/440 IU vitamin D3), given twice a day in patients with osteoporosis. Preference and acceptability were assessed by means of questionnaires. Preference was determined by asking the question, which treatment the patient preferred, and acceptability was measured by scoring five variables, using rating scales. Of the 102 patients indicating a preference for a trial medication, 67% preferred the chewable tablet, 19% the sachet with calcium and vitamin D(3,) and 15% stated no preference. The significant preference for Calci Chew D(3) (p < 0.0001) was associated with higher scores for all five acceptability variables. The two formulations were tolerated equally well. A significant greater number of patients considered the chewable tablet as preferable and acceptable to the sachet, containing calcium and vitamin D(3).

METHODS: In this phase 1/2 randomized study, adults with persistent moderate or severe inflammation in a target joint, being treated with or without systemic anti-TNF therapy, received a single IA injection of either rAAV2-TNFR:Fc (1 x 10(11), 1 x 10(12), or 1 x 10(13) DNase-resistant particles/ml joint volume) or placebo, followed by open-label rAAV2-TNFR:Fc 12-30 weeks later, depending on when the target joint met predetermined criteria for reinjection.
RESULTS: 127 subjects received the first injection of blinded study drug; 95 subjects received open-label rAAV2-TNFR:Fc. Administration site reactions, consisting of transient mild to moderate increases in tenderness and swelling of the injected joint, occurred after 23/191 (12%) rAAV2-TNFR:Fc injections and were dose-dependent. Rates of other adverse events were not dose-dependent. Notable serious adverse events (SAE) included culture-negative septic arthritis in a subject receiving leflunomide and fatal disseminated histoplasmosis considered unrelated to rAAV2-TNFR:Fc in a subject receiving adalimumab. In the phase 2 portion of the study, a 30% decrease in target joint global visual analog scale was observed in 21/50 (42%) rAAV2-TNFR:Fc subjects and 3/16 (19%) placebo subjects 12 weeks after first injection (p = 0.14).
CONCLUSION: IA rAAV2-TNFR:Fc resulted in administration site reactions after 12% of injections. A fatal SAE, disseminated histoplasmosis, was considered not related to study agent.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, clinical pilot trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of the LAB probiotic preparation, Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086, on symptoms and measures of functional capacity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with pharmacological anti-arthritic medications.
METHODS: forty-five adult men and women with symptoms of RA were randomly assigned to receive Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 or placebo once a day in a double-blind fashion for 60 days in addition to their standard anti-arthritic medications. Arthritis activity was evaluated by clinical examination, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and laboratory tests for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).
RESULTS: subjects who received Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 experienced borderline statistically significant improvement in the Patient Pain Assessment score (P = .052) and statistically significant improvement in Pain Scale (P = .046) vs placebo. Compared with placebo, Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 treatment resulted in greater improvement in patient global assessment and self-assessed disability; reduction in CRP; as well as the ability to walk 2 miles, reach, and participate in daily activities.

In this study we aimed to document the long-term clinical and radiographic outcome as well as component survival in a randomized controlled trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred fifteen patients (240 hips) were randomly allocated to receive a cemented Charnley cup or uncemented Duraloc 1200 cup. All patients received cemented Charnley stems and were evaluated clinically and radiographically after 6 months, and 2, 5, and 10 years.
RESULTS: Harris Hip Scores improved from 48.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 45.0-51.6] to 90.2 [95% CI 87.9-92.6] in the Charnley group and from 49.3 [95% CI 86.9-91.3] in the Duraloc group at 6 months. After 10 years, the Charnley group's Harris Hip Score was 89.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 87.0-92.6], and the Duraloc group's score was 87.3 (95% CI 84.1-90.6). In the radiographic analysis after 10 years, there was no statistical difference in the prevalence of radiographic signs of loosening. Nine cups were revised in the Charnley group, and five cups were removed in the Duraloc group. The difference was not statistically significant. There was no statistical difference between the cups when aseptic loosening was the end-point, nor in survival analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no statistically significant difference in clinical or radiological outcome between the Charnley cup and the Duraloc after 10 years, and no difference in implant survival after 12-14 years. The uncemented Duraloc cup is as good as the cemented Charnley cup after 10 years."

METHODS: We randomly allocated patients with RA with disease duration < 2 years to different nonbiologic disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapies in a double-blind trial. Progression of articular destruction over the 96-week treatment period was assessed using the modified Sharp method.
RESULTS: Progression of articular destruction correlated more strongly with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set measures after 12 weeks of treatment than with pretreatment values. Multiple regression analysis of data after 12 weeks yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.711. The sensitivity and specificity to predict articular destruction over the 75th percentile of the cohort were 78.6% and 84.6%, respectively. Patients who showed articular destruction over the 75th percentile of the cohort had low response to treatment at 12 weeks, and continued to have high clinical disease activity thereafter. Contrasting data were found in patients with slow progression of articular destruction.
CONCLUSION: In patients with early RA, ACR core set measures after 12 weeks of nonbiologic DMARD treatment may predict articular destruction 2 years later. Low response to treatment at 12 weeks and continuing high disease activity thereafter were found in patients with rapid radiological progression. These data can be used to determine the appropriateness of treatment at 12 weeks and aid the decision to introduce biologic DMARD."

Data were gathered by follow-up of the participants who completed the 2-year high-intensity intervention in a randomized controlled trial (Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient In Training study). Eighteen months thereafter, measurements of compliance, aerobic capacity, muscle strength, functional ability, disease activity, and radiological damage of the large joints were performed. Seventy-one patients were available for follow-up at 18 months, of whom 60 (84%) were still exercising (exercise group: EG), with average similar intensity but at a lower frequency as the initial intervention. Eleven patients (16%) reported low intensity or no exercises (no-exercise group: no-EG). Patients in the EG had better aerobic fitness and functional ability, lower disease activity, and higher attendance rate after the initial 2-year intervention. At follow-up, both groups showed a deterioration of aerobic fitness and only patients in the EG were able to behold their muscle strength gains. Functional ability, gained during the previous participation in high-intensity exercises, remained stable in both groups. Importantly, no detrimental effects on disease activity or radiological damage of the large joints were found in either group. In conclusion, the majority of the patients who participated in the 24-month high-intensity exercise program continued exercising in the ensuing 18 months. In contrast to those who did not continue exercising, they were able to preserve their gains in muscle strength without increased disease activity or progression of radiological damage.

Indications: Primary TKA with range of motion >100degree, leg axis up to >10degree varus or valgus, body weight > 100 kg. Contraindications: Contracted knees, leg axis <10degree varus or valgus, obesity, previous knee surgery except arthroscopic procedures, rheumatoid arthritis. Surgical Technique: Anterior midline incision. Soft-tissue preparation and capsule incision start at the upper tip of the patella and are continued distally along the medial patellar border ending at the tibial tuberosity. After opening of the joint, the patella is dislocated laterally without everting it. Exposure of the articular surface using a ""mobile window"". Preparation and insertion of the TKA components using special instruments. Wound closure in layers. Postoperative Management: Mobilization on crutches with full weight bearing starting on the day of surgery. Daily medical training therapy. Passive motion therapy continued twice a day. Low-dose heparin s.c. for 35 days after surgery. Results: In a prospective randomized clinical study, 50 patients with a quadsparing (QS) approach were observed up to 3 months after surgery. In three patients, the use of large femoral components required an extended approach. During the hospital stay knee flexion was significantly greater in patients with the QS approach than in patients with the standard procedure (midvastus approach). There were no differences in implant positioning, Knee Society Score and complication rate between both groups. Use of the QS approach prolonged the duration of surgery by 25 min.  Urban & Vogel."

The dose recommended for rheumatoid arthritis (3 mg/kg) is also clinically effective for ankylosing spondylitis (AS), although effects on spinal inflammation as defined by MRI have yet to be described in a placebo-controlled trial.
METHODS: In a 12-week double-blind period, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either IFX 3 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, or placebo. Spinal inflammation in discovertebral units (DVU) was measured by the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) MRI Index at baseline and 12 weeks by 3 readers blinded to timepoint and treatment allocation. We also compared reliability and discrimination of the SPARCC MRI index based on evaluation of the entire spine (23 DVU score) compared to assessment of only the 6 most severely affected DVU (6 DVU score).
RESULTS: At Week 12, patients treated with IFX experienced mean reductions of 55.1% and 57.2% in the 6 DVU and 23 DVU SPARCC scores, respectively, compared with a mean increase of 5.8% and decrease of 3.4% in 6 DVU and 23 DVU scores, respectively, for patients taking placebo (p < 0.001). A large treatment effect (Guyatt's effect size >or= 1.7) and high reliability was evident and comparable between 6 DVU and 23 DVU scoring methods.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with low-dose IFX leads to a large treatment effect on spinal inflammation as measured by MRI. Scoring for inflammation of only the most severely affected regions of the spine by MRI is comparable to assessment of the entire spine."

AIMS: To explore indications and key points of anterolateral minimally-invasive total hip arthroplasty.
METHODS: 110 patients admitted for unilateral total hip arthroplasty were randomly selected for surgery with either anterolateral minimally-invasive incision or standard posterolateral incision. Demographic data, perioperative index and postoperative function index were recorded and statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: No significant difference was detected in operation time, abduction angle, anteversion angle, stem alignment and stem fixation. The incision length, blood loss, perioperative transfusion and 100-mm VAS score at the first 24 h in minimally-invasive group were significantly lower. The Harris hip score and Barthel index were significantly higher in minimally-invasive group at 3 months' follow-up, but not significantly different 3 years after operation.
CONCLUSIONS: There are fewer traumas, fewer blood losses and more rapid recovery in this approach."

SUBJECTS/METHODS: This was a single-blind co-intervention study performed at the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology of Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. Patients were diagnosed with RA according to the 1991 American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: control (5 mg/day folic acid only; n=15) or vitamin B(6) (5 mg/day folic acid plus 100 mg/day vitamin B(6); n=20) for 12 weeks. Plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), serum folate, inflammatory parameters (that is, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)) and immune parameters (that is, white blood cell, total lymphocyte, T-cell (CD3), B-cell (CD19), T-helper cell (CD4), T-suppressor (CD8)) were measured on day 1 (week 0) and after 12 weeks (week 12) of the intervention.
RESULTS: In the group receiving vitamin B(6), plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels significantly decreased at week 12. There were no significant changes with respect to immune responses in both groups except for the percentage of total lymphocytes in the vitamin B(6) group when compared with week 0 and week 12. Plasma IL-6 level remained significantly inversely related to plasma PLP after adjusting for confounders (beta=-0.01, P=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: A large dose of vitamin B(6) supplementation (100 mg/day) suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (that is, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in patients with RA."

METHODS: a nonblind pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT01011179) was conducted to test the feasibility of the ""teens taking charge: managing arthritis online"" internet intervention across 4 tertiary-level centers in canada. Participants were 46 adolescents with JIA, ages 12 to 18 years, and 1 parent for each participant, WHO were randomized to the control arm (n = 24) or the internet intervention (n = 22). RESULTS: the 2 groups were comparable on demographic and disease-related variables and treatment expectation at baseline. Attrition rates were 18.1% and 20.8%, respectively, from experimental and control groups. Ninety-one percent of participants randomized to the experimental group completed all 12 online modules and weekly phone calls with a coach in an average of 14.7 weeks (SD 2.1). The control group completed 90% of weekly attention-control phone calls. The internet treatment was rated AS acceptable by all youth and their parents. In posttreatment the experimental group had significantly higher knowledge (p < 0.001, effect size 1.32) and lower average weekly pain intensity (p = 0.03, effect size 0.78). There were no significant group differences in HRQOL, self-efficacy, adherence, and stress posttreatment. CONCLUSION: findings support the feasibility (acceptability, compliance, and user satisfaction) and initial efficacy of internet delivery of a self-management program for improving disease-specific knowledge and reducing pain in youth with JIA."

Patients with active RA entered a randomized open-label 12-month study of anakinra 100 mg/day, administered as monotherapy or in combination with pegsunercept 800 ≈í¬∫g/kg twice weekly. Arthroscopic synovial tissue biopsies were obtained at baseline, at 4 weeks and at the final time point. Following immunohistochemical staining, RANKL and OPG expression was quantified using digital image analysis. Radiographic damage was evaluated using the van der Heijde modification of the Sharp scoring system. Twenty-two patients were randomized. Baseline expression of RANKL, but not OPG, correlated significantly with baseline CRP levels (r = 0.61, P < 0.01). While a significant reduction in OPG expression following treatment was observed in clinical responders at the final time point (P < 0.05 vs. baseline), RANKL levels did not change, and the RANKL: OPG ratio remained unaltered, even at the highest levels of clinical response. When potential predictors of radiographic outcome were evaluated, baseline RANKL expression correlated with erosive progression at 1 year (r = 0.71, P < 0.01). Distinct, though related, pathophysiologic processes mediate joint inflammation and destruction in RA. Elevated synovial tissue RANKL expression is associated with progressive joint erosion, and may be independent of the clinical response to targeted therapy. The potential therapeutic importance of modulating RANKL in RA is highlighted, if radiographic arrest is to be achieved."

The evidence base for current medical and therapeutic management options of hemiplegic shoulder pain is limited. This study will evaluate the use of suprascapular nerve block injection as part of an interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of shoulder pain following stroke. The technique has previously been proven safe and effective in the treatment of shoulder pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis and degenerative shoulder conditions but its usefulness in a stroke population is unclear.
METHODS/DESIGN: A double blind randomised placebo controlled trial will assess the effect of a suprascapular nerve block compared with placebo in a population of 66 stroke patients. The trial will measure effect of injection on the primary outcome of pain, and secondary outcomes of function and quality of life. Measurements will take place at baseline, and 1, 4 and 12 weeks post intervention. Both groups will continue to receive routine physiotherapy and standard ward care.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study could reduce pain symptoms in persons with mechanical shoulder pain post stroke and provide improvement in upper limb function.

9260644,,10.3899/jrheum.100051,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of longterm low-dose chronotherapy with modified-release (MR) prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as part of the Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis (CAPRA-1) study. This consisted of a 3-month active-controlled phase and a 9-month open-label extension with MR prednisone including patients previously treated with prednisone (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00146640).
METHODS: Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) tests were performed on 28 patients at 3 timepoints: at baseline on prestudy immediate-release (IR) prednisone, after the 3-month double-blind phase on either IR prednisone or MR prednisone, and after the 9-month open-label extension on MR prednisone. Changes of cortisol were assessed and compared to individual patients' efficacy and safety data.
RESULTS: The increase (mean, SD) of cortisol plasma concentrations after injection of corticorelin was 5.5 (4.37) Œºg/dl on IR prednisone at baseline (n = 21) and 5.3 (4.07) Œºg/dl on MR prednisone at 12 months (n = 22). Numbers of normal/suppressed/no response reactions did not differ among treatments. Switching from IR to MR prednisone did not influence responses, nor did longterm treatment of up to 12 months with MR prednisone. No worsening of adrenal impairment was observed on treatment with nighttime-release prednisone in patients with low responsiveness to CRH testing before the treatment with MR prednisone.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with nighttime-release prednisone did not change adrenocortical function over 12 months. We presume that chronotherapy with this nighttime-release prednisone may improve the efficacy of longterm low-dose glucocorticoid treatment in patients with RA."

The objectives of the present article are to report the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with active RA in real clinical practice. In total, 61 patients with RA were treated with tocilizumab. Any comorbidities they had, especially infections, were treated thoroughly before they were given the drug. We provided guidance on infection control and prevention. Mean age of the patients was 60.9 +/- 12.4 years, and their mean disease duration 10.9 +/- 9.2 years. The patients remained on steroids, methotrexate, and tacrolimus as before, but were taken off any other drugs they had been using prior to the treatment. Mean of the 28-joint disease activity score using erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 4.75 +/- 1.15 initially and fell to 2.21 +/- 0.97 after two doses (n = 50). After four doses, the remission rate was 83.8% (31/37). All patients responded well to the therapy and there was no decrease in the efficacy of tocilizumab during the treatment. Even in the real clinical setting, treatment with tocilizumab can rapidly induce remission in RA in a high proportion of patients and is generally safe and well tolerated. Tocilizumab would seem to be promising as a first-line choice for the treatment of RA."

This has previously not been examined for periarticular bone loss, the other characteristic feature of bone involvement in RA.The objective of this study was to examine if treatment with the TNF-Œ± inhibitor adalimumab also could reduce periarticular bone loss in RA patients independent of disease activity.
METHODS: RA patients were recruited from the PREMIER study and included 214 patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) plus adalimumab and 188 patients treated with MTX monotherapy. Periarticular bone loss was assessed by digital X-ray radiogrammetry metacarpal cortical index (DXR-MCI). Change in DXR-MCI was evaluated in patients with different levels of clinical response, as assessed by changes in DAS28 score at 52 weeks and in mean C-reactive protein (CRP) levels during follow-up.
RESULTS: in the MTX group, there was a greater median DXR-MCI loss among patients with moderate and high disease activity compared to those in remission or with low disease activity (-3.3% vs. -2.2%, p = 0.01). In contrast, periarticular bone loss was independent of disease activity (-1.9% vs. -2.4%, p = 0.99) in the combination group. In the MTX group patients with a mean CRP of ‚â• 10 mg/l lost significantly more DXR-MCI than patients with low CRP (-3.1% vs. -1.9%, p <0.01) whereas in the combination group no significant differences between the two CRP groups was seen (-2.4% vs. -2.0%, p = 0.48).
CONCLUSION: adalimumab in combination with MTX reduces periarticular bone loss independently of clinical response. These results support the hypothesis that TNF-Œ± stimulates the osteoclast not only by the inflammatory pathway but do also have a direct effect on the osteoclast.

METHODS: This study included 30 patients with early RA, randomly divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (n = 15) received methotrexate (MTX; 0.2 mg/kg/week; mean (15.5 ¬± SD 1.3) plus prednisone (10 mg/day). Group 2 (n = 15) received MTX and prednisone with the same previous doses plus atorvastatin therapy (40 mg/day). Ten healthy individuals of similar age and sex served as controls. Disease activity, lipid profile, serum malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), resistin, adiponectin, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were measured before and after 6 months of treatment.
RESULTS: Atorvastatin combined with MTX therapy significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001). Disease activity variables, serum MDA, TNF-Œ±, resistin, adiponectin, and FMD were significantly improved by the drug combinations (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Atorvastatin therapy in patients with RA reduced disease activity and conventional and novel vascular risk factors that promote the atheromatous lesion. Therapy was also associated with concomitant improvement in endothelial function."

METHODS: Joints with inflammatory arthritis (n = 244; 76% rheumatoid arthritis, 3% small joints, 51% intermediate, and 46% large) were randomized to injection by conventional palpation-guided anatomic injection (120 joints) or sonographic image-guided injection enhanced with a 1-handed reciprocating procedure device mechanical syringe (124 joints). A 1-needle, 2-syringe technique was used. After IA placement and synovial space dilation were confirmed by sonography, a syringe exchange was performed, and triamcinolone acetonide was injected with the second syringe through the indwelling IA needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, pain at outcome (2 weeks and 6 months), responders, therapeutic duration, reinjection rates, total cost, and cost per responder were determined.
RESULTS: Relative to conventional palpation-guided methods, sonographic guidance for injection of inflammatory arthritis resulted in an 81% reduction in injection pain (p < 0.001), 35% reduction in pain scores at outcome (p < 0.02), 38% increase in the responder rate (p < 0.003), 34% reduction in the non-responder rate (p < 0.003), 32% increase in therapeutic duration (p = 0.01), 8% reduction ($7) in cost/patient/year, and a 33% ($64) reduction in cost/responder/year for a hospital outpatient (p < 0.001).

It was the aim of this study to evaluate its population pharmacokinetics in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and characterize patient covariates that affect its disposition in this population.
METHODS: Information collected from 482 patients in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international studies were analyzed using NONMEM.
RESULTS: A two-compartment, population pharmacokinetic model described the serum infliximab concentration-time data. Population pharmacokinetic estimates (typical value +/- standard error), based on the final covariate model, were clearance (CL: 0.407 +/- 0.0103 L/day), apparent volumes of distribution in the central (V(1): 3.29 +/- 0.0679 L) and peripheral (V(2): 4.13 +/- 0.16 L) compartments, and intercompartment clearance (Q: 7.14 +/- 0.489 L/day). Infliximab exhibited interindividual variability for CL and V(1) of 37.7% and 22.1%, respectively. Infliximab t(1/2) is approximately 14 days. Covariate analysis showed that V(1) increased as body weight increased, and CL was higher in patients who developed antibodies to infliximab. An additional novel covariate, serum albumin concentration, was found to be inversely and strongly related to infliximab clearance in this population.
CONCLUSIONS: The disposition of infliximab in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, unlike in rheumatoid arthritis, was not affected by coadministration of immunomodulators and corticosteroids but was related to formation of antibodies to infliximab and, notably, to serum albumin levels."
9260675,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0001041,"BACKGROUND: Leprosy Type 1 reactions are a major cause of nerve damage and the preventable disability that results. Type 1 reactions are treated with oral corticosteroids and there are few data to support the optimal dose and duration of treatment. Type 1 reactions have a Th1 immune profile: cells in cutaneous and neural lesions expressing interferon-Œ≥ and interleukin-12. Methylprednisolone has been used in other Th1 mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis in an attempt to switch off the immune response and so we investigated the efficacy of three days of high dose (1 g) intravenous methylprednisolone at the start of prednisolone therapy in leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment.
RESULTS: Forty-two individuals were randomised to receive methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone (n = 20) or oral prednisolone alone (n = 22). There were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement at the completion of the study. However individuals treated with methylprednisolone were less likely than those treated with prednisolone alone to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study. The study also demonstrated that 50% of individuals with Type 1 reactions and/or nerve function impairment required additional prednisolone despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids.
CONCLUSIONS: The study lends further support to the use of more prolonged courses of corticosteroid to treat Type 1 reactions and the investigation of risk factors for the recurrence of Type 1 reaction and nerve function impairment during and after a corticosteroid treatment.

However, individuals with RA taking anti-TNFŒ± medication continue to experience physical, psychological and functional consequences, which could potentially benefit from rehabilitation. There is evidence that therapeutic exercise should be included as an intervention for people with RA, but to date there is little evidence of the benefits of therapeutic exercise for people with RA on anti-TNFŒ± therapy medication. A protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled three-armed study which aims to examine the effect of dynamic group exercise therapy on land or in water for people with RA taking anti-TNFŒ± therapy medication is described.
METHODS/DESIGN: six hundred and eighteen individuals with RA, on anti-TNFŒ± therapy medication, will be randomised into one of 3 groups: a land-based exercise group; a water-based exercise group or a control group. The land and water-based groups will exercise for one hour, twice a week for eight weeks. The control group will receive no intervention and will be asked not to alter their exercise habits for the duration of the study. The primary outcome measure, the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) which measures functional ability, and secondary measures of pain, fatigue and quality of life, will be assessed at baseline, eight and 24 weeks by an independent assessor unaware of group allocation. Changes in outcome from 0 to 8 weeks and 0 to 24 weeks in the 'land-based exercise group versus control group' and the 'water-based exercise group versus control group' will be examined. Analysis will be conducted on an intention to treat basis.
DISCUSSION: this trial will evaluate the effectiveness of group exercise therapy on land or in water, for people with RA taking anti-TNFŒ± therapy medication. If these exercise groups are found to be beneficial, they could be conducted in local community facilities thus making these forms of exercise more easily accessible for individuals and potentially reduce the burden on health services.

Chinese medicine patterns are a group of associated symptoms, tongue appearances and pulse characteristics. These limitations could be overcome by developing new strategies to evaluate the effect of Chinese medicine. The idea behind pattern-based efficacy evaluations may optimize clinical trial design by identifying the responsiveness-related Chinese medicine patterns.
METHODS/DESIGN: this is a two-stage multi-center trial of Chinese herbal medicine for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. The stage one trial is an open-label trial and aims to explore what groups of Chinese medicine information (such as symptoms) correlates with better efficacy, and the stage two trial is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial that incorporates the efficacy-related information identified in the stage-one trial into the inclusion criteria.
DISCUSSION: the indication of a Chinese herbal formula is a specific Chinese medicine pattern and not a single disease and stratifying a disease into several patterns with a group of symptoms is a feasible procedure in clinical trials. This study is the first to investigate whether this approach in the design of Chinese herbal medicine trials can improve responses.

METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive SCIO-469 at either 30 or 60 mg three times daily in an immediate-release (IR) formulation or at 100 mg once daily in an extended-release (ER) formulation, or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response at Week 12. Safety was monitored through Week 26.
RESULTS: Overall, 302 patients were randomized: 76 to placebo, 75 to 30 mg IR, 73 to 60 mg IR, and 78 to 100 mg ER. There were no significant differences in ACR20 responses at Week 12 between SCIO-469 and placebo. Declines in C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate during early treatment did not persist to Week 12 and were not a consequence of decreased SCIO-469 plasma levels. The 60 mg IR regimen showed a dose-limiting toxicity manifested by elevations in alanine aminotransferase. Adverse events were common in all groups (79.7% and 86.7% through 13 and 26 weeks, respectively). Twenty-one patients reported 28 serious adverse events (SAE). SAE were more common with IR SCIO-469 than with placebo (7% vs 4%) but were not reported with ER SCIO-469.
CONCLUSION: In all regimens tested, SCIO-469 showed no greater efficacy compared to placebo in patients with RA. The transient effect of SCIO-469 on acute-phase reactants suggests a complex role of p38 MAPK in inflammation."

Clinical outcomes were assessed every 4 weeks for 24 weeks by using the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. After 24 weeks, more patients achieved clinical benefits as determined by the ACR20 improvement treated with anakinra plus MTX compared with MTX alone (64% vs. 17%, P = 0.004). In the anakinra group, an ACR50 response was observed in 38% and an ACR70 response in 17%. None of the patients treated with MTX alone achieved ACR50 or ACR 70 improvement. However, nine of 42 (21.4%) patients in the anakinra group, who showed therapeutic response initially, had secondary drug failure to anakinra therapy thereafter. A significant increase in mean DAS28 from baseline was found in the non-responders to anakinra compared with placebo (0.83 ¬¨¬± 1.38 vs. -1.28 ¬¨¬± 0.78, P < 0.001). Anakinra is effective in the treatment of patients with active RA by blocking IL-1. However, the efficacy of anakinra is soon lost in about one fifth of patients in spite of initial good response."

Ninety-seven patients, mainly suffering from undifferentiated arthritis (40%) or rheumatoid arthritis (31%), received 165 injections (including crossovers). Clinical effect at 6 months was not related to the baseline ultrasonographic extent of effusion or synovial thickness, nor with ultrasonographic decrease of effusion after the first 3 months. Nevertheless, it was associated with ultrasonographic decrease of synovial thickness within the first 3 months.

The current study aimed to: (1) evaluate the effects of combined strength and endurance training (CT) on disease activity and functional ability in patients with RA and (2) investigate the benefits of a 6-month supervised CT program on muscle strength, cardio-respiratory fitness, and body composition of RA patients. Forty patients with RA, aged 41-73 years, were recruited for the current study. Twenty of these patients (19 females, one male) were randomly assigned to a 6-month supervised CT program; 20 patients (17 females, three males) served as controls. Within the CT program, strength training consisted of sets of weight bearing exercises for all major muscle groups. In addition to strength training, systematic endurance training was performed on a cycle ergometer two times per week. For RA patients involved in CT, disease activity (p = 0.06) and pain (p = 0.05) were reduced after the 6-month training period while general health (p = 0.04) and functional ability (p = 0.06) improved. Cardio-respiratory endurance was found to have improved significantly (by 10%) after 6 months of CT (p < 0.001). The overall strength of patients undertaking CT increased by an average of 14%. Lean body mass increased, and the percentage of body fat was found to decrease significantly (p < 0.05). A combination of strength and endurance training resulted in considerable improvements in RA patients' muscle strength and cardio-respiratory endurance, accompanied by positive changes in body composition and functional ability. Long-term training appears to be effective in reducing disease activity and associated pain and was found to have no deleterious effects."

METHODS: From July 2007 to March 2009, 86 patients with active RA who were diagnosed as damp-heat and blood stasis syndrome were randomly divided into QRHX group and QRHX plus methotrexate (MTX) group, 43 cases in each group. Patients in the QRHX group were treated with QRHX decoction [composed of Huangbai, Chishao, Bixie, Danshen, Ezhu, Qingfengteng, raw Huangqi, Jinyinhua, Tufuling, Wugong, Fengfang, raw Yiyiren, which was cooked with water as 400 ml liquid); while patients in the other group were treated with QRHX decoction plus MTX. After one-year observation, 21 patients in each group (42 in total) were evaluated,with 19 females in QRHX group, average age of (43.0 +/- 11.3) years, and the course of the disease was 2 (1,3) years; and 18 females in QRHX+MTX group, average age of (44.5 +/- 14.0) years, and the course of the disease was 3 (1.7, 5) years. Radiographs of hands were obtained at baseline and 12 months after treatment. Images were evaluated by investigators blinded to chronology and clinical data, and assessed according to Sharp/van der Heijde methods.
RESULTS: High intrareader agreements were reached (mean intraobserver intraclass coefficients: 0.95). No significant change in any imaging parameters of joint destruction was observed at 12 months after treatment in both groups; and there were no statistical differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). The severity of progress in two groups was also similar (P = 0.46), 7 patients without radiographic progress in QRHX group and 8 patients in QRHX+MTX group,3 patients with obvious radiographic progress in QRHX group and 1 patient in QRHX+MTX group.

The authors indirectly compared response rates and costs per responder associated with biologic treatments for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD), psoriasis (Ps), and/or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify phase 3 randomized controlled trials of biologics for CD (adalimumab, infliximab), Ps (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, ustekinumab 45 mg, ustekinumab 90 mg), or methotrexate-refractory RA (abatacept, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab). Food and Drug Administration-approved dosing schedules were evaluated. Published response rates were extracted, with response defined in CD, Ps, and RA as: >=70-point reduction in CD Activity Index at 12 months; =75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index at 3 months; and >=50% improvement in American College of Rheumatology component scores at 6 months. Within each indication, mixed-treatment comparison meta-analyses were conducted to derive pooled estimates and 95% CIs of response rate difference versus placebo for each biologic, adjusting for cross-trial variation in control-arm response rates. Cost per responder was estimated for each biologic as projected per patient drug costs (2011 US$) divided by response rate difference. Results: Altogether, 23 publications were selected. In CD, 12-month cost per responder was estimated at $116,291 (95% CI $71,637, $208,348) for adalimumab and $125,169 (95% CI $60,532, $267,101) for infliximab. Among biologics approved in Ps, 3-month cost per responder was lowest for adalimumab ($9,756; 95% CI $8,668, $11,131), infliximab ($12,828; 95% CI $11,772, $13,922), and ustekinumab 45 mg ($13,821; 95% CI $12,599, $15,167). In RA, biologics with the lowest 6-month cost per responder were adalimumab ($27,853; 95% CI $19,284, $40,270), etanercept ($29,140; 95% CI $14,170, $61,030), and tocilizumab ($31,363; 95% CI $14,713, $64,232). Conclusion: Meta-analyses of clinical trials found considerable variation in cost-effectiveness of biologic therapies for CD, Ps, and RA. These results may help determine biologic utilization in these chronic diseases. The Author(s) 2012."

PG can BE extremely difficult to treat and patients often require systemic immunosuppression. Recurrent lesions of PG are common, but the relative rarity of this condition means that there is a lack of published evidence regarding its treatment. A systematic review published in 2005 found no randomised controlled trials (rcts) relating to the treatment of PG. Since this time, one small RCT has been published comparing infliximab to placebo, but none of the commonly used systemic treatments for PG have been formally assessed. The UK dermatology clinical trials network's STOP GAP trial has been designed to address this lack of trial evidence. METHODS: the objective is to assess whether oral ciclosporin is more effective than oral prednisolone for the treatment of PG. The trial design is a two-arm, observer-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial comparing ciclosporin (4‚Äâmg/kg/day) to prednisolone (0.75‚Äâmg/kg/day). A total of 140 participants are to BE recruited over a period of 4‚Äâyears, from up to 50 hospitals in the UK and eire. Primary outcome of velocity of healing at 6‚Äâweeks is assessed blinded to treatment allocation (using digital images of the ulcers). Secondary outcomes include: (i) time to healing; (ii) global assessment of improvement; (iii) PG inflammation assessment scale score; (iv) self-reported pain; (v) health-related quality of life; (vi) time to recurrence; (vii) treatment failures; (viii) adverse reactions to study medications; and (ix) cost effectiveness/utility. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PG (excluding granulomatous PG); measurable ulceration (that is, not pustular PG); and patients aged over 18‚Äâyears old WHO are able to give informed consent are included in the trial. Randomisation is by computer generated code using permuted blocks of randomly varying size, stratified by lesion size, and presence or absence of underlying systemic disease (for example, rheumatoid arthritis).patients WHO require topical therapy are asked to enter a parallel observational study (case series). If topical therapy fails and systemic therapy is required, participants are then considered for inclusion in the randomised trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: current controlled trials: iSRCTN35898459.

METHODS: five-year radiographs of the spine of 275 patients in the best study, a randomized trial comparing four treatment strategies, were used. Treatment was das-steered (DAS ‚â§ 2.4). A height reduction >20% in one vertebra was defined a vertebral fracture. With linear mixed models, DAS and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) scores over 5 years were compared for patients with and without vfs. With generalized estimating equations the association between BMD and vfs was determined. RESULTS: vfs were observed in 41/275 patients (15%). No difference in prevalence was found when stratified for gender, prednisone use and menopausal status. Disease activity over time was higher in patients with vfs, mean difference 0.20 (95% CI: 0.05-0.36), and also HAQ scores were higher, independent of disease activity, with a mean difference of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.02-0.2). Age was associated with vfs (OR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.09), mean BMD in spine and hip over time were not (OR 95% CI, 0.99: 0.78-1.25 and 0.94: 0.65-1.36, respectively). CONCLUSION: after 5 years of das-steered treatment, 15% of these RA patients had vfs. Higher age was associated with the presence of vfs, mean BMD in hip and spine were not. Patients with vfs have greater functional disability over time and a higher disease activity, suggesting that vfs may BE prevented by optimal disease activity suppression."

People with rheumatoid arthritis usually require lifelong specialist follow-up but frequently have periods when their disease can be managed through self-care or that provided by their general practitioner. Compared to the traditional clinician-driven care in rheumatoid arthritis, patient-initiated care has proven to be more beneficial in terms of reducing unnecessary medical reviews, providing greater satisfaction to patients and staffs and maintaining the patient's physical and psychological status. We aim to evaluate the implementation of a patient-initiated review system in a routine secondary care rheumatology service in a public hospital in England, where patients get the opportunity to self-manage their disease by requesting specialist reviews at times of need instead of clinician-scheduled appointments.
METHODS/DESIGN: Three hundred and eighty patients attending routine review at Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust will be randomised to either enrol immediately into a patient-initiated review system (direct access group), or to be seen regularly by a clinician at the hospital (regular clinician-initiated group). Patients (or their general practitioner) in the direct access group can arrange a review by calling a rheumatology nurse-led advice line that enables telephone delivered clinical advice, or where appropriate, an appointment with a rheumatologist within 10 working days. Patients in the regular clinician-initiated group will attend their planned appointments at regular intervals during the intervening period of 12 months. The primary outcome of interest is patient satisfaction; secondary outcomes include service use, waiting times and clinical measures. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews will be conducted with a subset of patients and staff with the aim of identifying facilitators/barriers in implementing patient-initiated clinics.
DISCUSSION: The implementation of a patient-initiated review system in routine care rheumatology will replace the fixed clinician-driven review system with a more flexible patient-driven system where patients usually self-manage their disease, but can request prompt help when required. We believe that this study will enable a comparison of the changes in local services and will be helpful in exploring the benefits/drawbacks of such implementation, thus providing lessons for implementation in other hospitals and for other chronic diseases."

Strategies to maintain work productivity exist, but these interventions do not involve the actual workplace. Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the (cost)effectiveness of an intervention program at the workplace on work productivity for workers with RA.
METHODS/DESIGN: this study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in specialized rheumatology treatment centers in or near Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Randomisation to either the control or the intervention group is performed at patient level. Both groups will receive care as usual by the rheumatologist, and patients in the intervention group will also take part in the intervention program. The intervention program consists of two components; integrated care, including a participatory workplace intervention. Integrated care involves a clinical occupational physician, who will act as care manager, to coordinate the care. The care manager has an intermediate role between clinical and occupational care. The participatory workplace intervention will be guided by an occupational therapist, and involves problem solving by the patient and the patients' supervisor. The aim of the workplace intervention is to achieve consensus between patient and supervisor concerning feasible solutions for the obstacles for functioning at work. Data collection will take place at baseline and after 6 and 12 months by means of a questionnaire. The primary outcome measure is work productivity, measured by hours lost from work due to presenteeism. Secondary outcome measures include sick leave, quality of life, pain and fatigue. Cost-effectiveness of the intervention program will be evaluated from the societal perspective.
DISCUSSION: usual care of primary and outpatient health services is not aimed at improving work productivity. Therefore it is desirable to develop interventions aimed at improving functioning at work. If the intervention program will be (cost)effective, substantial improvements in work productivity might be obtained among workers with RA at lower costs. Results are expected in 2015.

9260753,,10.1371/journal.pone.0027432,"BACKGROUND: Stress management interventions may prove useful in preventing the detrimental effects of stress on health. This study assessed the effects of a stress management intervention on the psychophysiological response to stress in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Seventy-four patients with RA, who were randomly assigned to either a control group or a group that received short-term stress management training, performed a standardized psychosocial stress task (Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) 1 week after the stress management training and at a 9-week follow-up. Psychological and physical functioning, and the acute psychophysiological response to the stress test were assessed.
RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group showed significantly lower psychological distress levels of anxiety after the training than did the controls. While there were no between-group differences in stress-induced tension levels, and autonomic (Œ±-amylase) or endocrine (cortisol) responses to the stress test 1 week after the intervention, levels of stress-induced tension and cortisol were significantly lower in the intervention group at the 9-week follow-up. Overall, the response to the intervention was particularly evident in a subgroup of patients with a psychological risk profile.
CONCLUSION: A relatively short stress management intervention can improve psychological functioning and influences the psychophysiological response to stress in patients with RA, particularly those psychologically at risk. These findings might help understand how stress can affect health and the role of individual differences in stress responsiveness.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: ‚Ä¢ The pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, are not altered when co-administered with tofacitinib in healthy subjects. ‚Ä¢ Tofacitinib is unlikely to affect the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes. ‚Ä¢ There is no need for dose adjustments of CYP substrates when co-administered with tofacitinib.
AIMS: to investigate inhibitive and inductive effects of tofacitinib (CP-690,550), a Janus kinase inhibitor, on CYP3A4 function via in vitro and in vivo studies.
METHODS: in vitro experiments were conducted to assess the inhibition and induction potential of tofacitinib for major drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). A phase 1, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study (NCT00902460) was conducted to confirm the lack of inhibitive/inductive effect on a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, midazolam, in healthy subjects. Midazolam pharmacokinetics were assessed over 24 h following single dose 2 mg administration prior to administering tofacitinib and after twice daily dosing of tofacitinib 30 mg for 6 days. The primary endpoint was midazolam area under the concentration-time profile, from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0,‚àû)).
RESULTS: in vitro studies demonstrated low potential for CYP inhibition (IC(50) estimates tofacitinib > 30 ¬µm), CYP3A4 mRNA induction (observed at tofacitinib concentrations ‚â• 25 ¬µm) and no effect on enzymatic activity of CYP substrates. In the human study, AUC(0,‚àû) adjusted geometric mean ratio for midazolam plus tofacitinib to midazolam alone was 103.97% , wholly within the pre-specified acceptance region (80, 125). The 90% CI for the ratio of adjusted geometric means of maximum plasma concentration (C(max) ) (95.98, 108.87) was also wholly within this acceptance region.
CONCLUSIONS: these data confirm a lack of an inhibitive or inductive effect of tofacitinib on CYP3A activity in humans and, in conjunction with in vitro data, support the conclusion that tofacitinib is unlikely to influence the CYP enzyme system as a whole."

With modest evidence on the therapeutic effectiveness of conventional hand exercises, a task-oriented training program via real life object manipulations has been developed for people with arthritis. An innovative, computer-based gaming platform that allows a broad range of common objects to be seamlessly transformed into therapeutic input devices through instrumentation with a motion-sense mouse has also been designed. Personalized objects are selected to target specific training goals such as graded finger mobility, strength, endurance or fine/gross dexterous functions. The movements and object manipulation tasks that replicate common situations in everyday living will then be used to control and play any computer game, making practice challenging and engaging.
METHODS/DESIGN: the ongoing study is a 6-week, single-center, parallel-group, equally allocated and assessor-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial. Thirty people with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis affecting the hand will be randomized to receive either conventional hand exercises or the task-oriented training. The purpose is to determine a preliminary estimation of therapeutic effectiveness and feasibility of the task-oriented training program. Performance based and self-reported hand function, and exercise compliance are the study outcomes. Changes in outcomes (pre to post intervention) within each group will be assessed by paired Student t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test and between groups (control versus experimental) post intervention using unpaired Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test.
DISCUSSION: the study findings will inform decisions on the feasibility, safety and completion rate and will also provide preliminary data on the treatment effects of the task-oriented training compared with conventional hand exercises in people with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis of the hand.

It is already a major cause of healthcare expenditure and its incidence will further increase with the ageing population. Current treatments for OA have major limitations and new analgesic treatments are needed. Synovitis is prevalent in OA and is associated with pain. Hydroxychloroquine is used in routine practice for treating synovitis in inflammatory arthritides, such AS rheumatoid arthritis. We propose that treating patients with symptomatic hand OA with hydroxychloroquine will BE a practical and safe treatment to reduce synovitis and pain. METHODS/DESIGN: HERO is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 252 subjects with symptomatic hand OA will BE recruited across primary and secondary care sites in the UK and randomized on a 1: 1 basis to active treatment or placebo for 12 months. Daily medication dose will range from 200 to 400 mg according to ideal body weight. The primary endpoint is change in average hand pain during the previous two weeks (measured on a numerical rating scale (NRS)) between baseline and six months. Secondary endpoints include other self-reported pain, function and quality-of-life measures and radiographic structural change at 12 months. A health economics analysis will also BE performed. An ultrasound substudy will BE conducted to examine baseline levels of synovitis. Linear and logistic regression will BE used to compare changes between groups using univariable and multivariable modelling analyses. All analyses will BE conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. DISCUSSION: the HERO trial is designed to examine whether hydroxychloroquine is an effective analgesic treatment for OA and whether it provides any long-term structural benefit. The ultrasound substudy will address whether baseline synovitis is a predictor of therapeutic response. This will potentially provide a new treatment for OA, which could BE of particular use in the primary care setting. Trial registration: isrctn91859104."

RESULTS: At 8 and 24 weeks, 7/12 and 6/12 receiving anakinra and 5/10 and 2/10 receiving DMARD achieved remission. Anakinra induced greater improvement in physical health measured by Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36; p < 0.011). During an open-label extension (OLE) of 28 weeks, 7/14 patients taking anakinra and 2/3 taking DMARD were in remission.

METHODS: Clinical and laboratory measures, including S-COMP and reactive hyperemic index (RHI), were examined in 55 consecutive patients with RA starting with either MTX (n = 34) or MTX and anti-TNF-Œ± treatment (n = 21) at baseline, and after 6 weeks and 6 months.
RESULTS: S-COMP was similar in the 2 treatment regimens during followup. We found a positive relationship between S-COMP at baseline and the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs the last year preceding the study (p = 0.001), and a negative relation to current use of systemic glucocorticosteroids (p = 0.044). The nonsignificant change in S-COMP between baseline and the 6-month followup was positively and independently related to change in ACPA level (p = 0.009). There was no significant association between RHI and level of S-COMP at baseline.
CONCLUSION: The cartilage turnover marker S-COMP did not change significantly after 6 months' treatment with MTX with or without a TNF-Œ± inhibitor in patients with RA. The positive association between S-COMP and ACPA suggests that these factors might interact, and could both be contributors to an unknown link between inflammation and cartilage destruction in patients with RA. S-COMP was not related to endothelial function in patients with RA, or to other cardiovascular risk factors studied. Clinical Trials registration number NCT00902005."

METHODS: Sixty RA patients with highly active disease of 6 months' to 3 years' duration were randomized to receive DFPP in combination with leflunomide and MTX (DFPP group), and leflunomide plus MTX (no-DFPP group). The primary endpoint was the improvement in MRI-detected synovitis from baseline over 6 months. Secondary endpoint variables included DAS28 remission and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria responses for 6 consecutive months.
RESULTS: The study achieved significant improvement in synovitis and bone edema, with significantly lower synovitis and bone edema scores in the DFPP group compared with the no-DFPP group (p < 0.001). Synovitis scores in 48.39% of patients (15/31) in the DFPP group were 0 at Month 6. Bone edema scores in 32.26% of patients (10/31) in the DFPP group were 0 at Month 6. We observed significantly greater ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, and ACR90 responses and DAS28 remission rates in the DFPP group than in the no-DFPP group (p < 0.001). Sustained DAS28 remission and ACR90 response for at least 6 months were achieved in 100% of patients receiving DFPP therapy.
CONCLUSION: The combination of DFPP and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) was superior to DMARD alone for reducing MRI-detected signs of synovitis and bone edema in patients with early highly active RA. DFPP therapy enabled rapid and more complete suppression of inflammation in patients with highly active RA. Nearly half the patients (48.39%) who had received DFPP therapy achieved both clinical remission and imaging remission, a state characterized as true remission."

METHODS: In our phase IIA study (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT00628095; A6341009), patients aged ‚â• 18 years with active RA were randomized to receive either CE-224,535 (500 mg bid) or placebo for 12 weeks; all patients continued a stable background dose of ‚â• 7.5 mg MTX.
RESULTS: The American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response rate (primary efficacy endpoint) was not significantly different from placebo for CE-224,535 (34.0% vs 36.2%; p = 0.591) at Week 12, or at any timepoint over the 12-week treatment period. There was no significant difference at Week 12 for the ACR20 response rate following subgroup analyses by age, sex, baseline disease activity, baseline duration of disease, geographic region, or concomitant use of steroids. ACR50/ACR70 response rates and change from baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-joint C-reactive protein (DAS28-3-CRP) and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index for CE-224,535 were not significant at Week 12 versus placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) were reported by 62.3% (CE-224,535) and 55.3% (placebo) of patients; the most common AE were nausea (11.3%, CE-224,535; 4.3%, placebo) and diarrhea (7.5%, CE-224,535; 4.3%, placebo). The proportion of patients discontinuing due to an AE was 9.4% (CE-224,535) and 6.4% (placebo); no deaths were reported. Serious AE occurred in 3.8% (CE-224,535) and 2.1% (placebo) of patients; none was considered treatment-related.
CONCLUSION: CE-224,535 was not efficacious, compared with placebo, for the treatment of RA in patients with an inadequate response to MTX. CE-224,535 demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile."
9260838,,10.3899/jrheum.110169,"OBJECTIVE: Optimizing therapeutic strategies to induce remission requires an understanding of the initial features predicting remission. Currently no suitable model exists. We aim to develop a remission score using predictors of remission in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: We used a dataset from a UK randomized controlled trial that evaluated intensive treatment with conventional combination therapy, to develop a predictive model for 24-month remission. We studied 378 patients in the trial who received 24 months' treatment. Our model was validated using data from a UK observational cohort (Early RA Network, ERAN). A group of 194 patients was followed for 24 months. Remission was defined as 28-joint Disease Activity Score < 2.6. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between remission and potential baseline predictors.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed age, sex, and tender joint count (TJC) were independently associated with 24-month remission. The multivariate remission score developed using the trial data correctly classified 80% of patients. These findings were replicated using ERAN. The remission score has high specificity (98%) but low sensitivity (13%). Combining data from the trial and ERAN, we also developed a simplified remission score that showed that younger men with a TJC of 5 or lower were most likely to achieve 24-month remission. Remission was least likely in older women with high TJC. Rheumatoid factor, rheumatoid nodules, and radiographic damage did not predict remission.
CONCLUSION: Remission can be predicted using a score based on age, sex, and TJC. The score is relevant in clinical trial and routine practice settings."

METHODS: RA patients with an inadequate response to MTX 6-8 mg/week received an infusion of 50, 200, or 500 mg OCR or placebo on Days 1 and 15 and were observed for 24 weeks. The double-blind period was prematurely terminated because of a possible risk for serious infection from OCR.
RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were randomized into the study. The incidence of infection was 37.7% (43/114) in the OCR groups combined, compared to 18.9% (7/37) in the placebo group. Serious infections occurred in 7 patients in the OCR groups combined; there were no serious infections in the placebo group. Among the serious infections, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia occurred in 2 patients in the OCR 200 mg group. The American College of Rheumatology 20% response rates at Week 24 (the primary endpoint) of the OCR 50, 200, and 500 mg groups were 54.1% (p = 0.0080), 55.6% (p = 0.0056), and 47.2% (p = 0.044), respectively, all significantly higher than that of the placebo group (25.0%).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest inappropriate benefit-risk balance of OCR in this patient population. Because rituximab is not approved for treatment of RA in Japan, it will be necessary to investigate safety and efficacy of other anti-B cell therapies in Japanese patients with RA.

Incident RA cases were identified via self-report and validated rheumatic medication use. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare RA incidence in the treatment versus placebo groups. The analysis included 32,435 women without the history of RA, of which 163 incident RA cases were identified over an average of 5.1 years. No significant differences in demographics, total personal vitamin D intake [P = 0.36], or solar irradiance [P = 0.68] were seen between the groups. In intention-to-treat analyses, no differences were observed in RA incidence [HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76, 1.41]. No significant modifying effects were seen for stratum of age, solar irradiance, or total vitamin D intake, overall or when adjusted for adherence. Significant effect modifications were seen between CaD and total vitamin D intake and CaD and solar irradiance that suggest increased RA incidence with high vitamin D exposure. CaD supplementation did not demonstrate a significant effect on RA incidence in postmenopausal women. Modifying effects between CaD and both solar irradiance and dietary vitamin D intake are suggestive that multiple high vitamin D exposures may increase RA incidence. Further research is needed to fully explore the benefits and possible adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation on RA."

Inhibition of interleukin (IL)-1 activity reduces experimental myocardial infarction by limiting apoptosis. We investigated whether a) soluble apoptotic markers are related with impaired left ventricular (LV) performance and b) treatment with anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, reduces apoptotic markers leading to improved LV performance in RA. We studied 46 RA patients. In an acute, double-blind cross-over trial, 23 patients were randomised to a single injection of anakinra or placebo and after 48 hours (h) to the alternative treatment. In a chronic trial, 23 patients who received anakinra for 30 days were compared with 23 patients who received prednisolone. At baseline, 3 h and 30 days after treatment, we measured circulating IL-1Œ≤, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ±, Fas, Fas-ligand and caspase-9 to assess apoptosis. At baseline and 30 days after treatment, we assessed LV longitudinal strain, strain rate and E/Em ratio using 2D-speckle tracking and tissue Doppler echocardiography. At baseline, increased apoptotic markers were related with reduced LongSRS and increased E/Em (p<0.05). After 3 h and 30 days of anakinra, there was a reduction in Fas (median 481 vs. 364 vs. 301 pg/ml), Fas-ligand (median 289 vs. 221 vs. 190 pg/ml), caspase-9 (median 1.90 vs. 1.40 vs. 1.07 ng/ml), TNF-Œ± and IL-1Œ≤ (p<0.05 for all comparisons). E/Em, LongS and LongSRS were improved after anakinra (p<0.01) and their percent changes were related with the corresponding changes of Fas and caspase-9 (p<0.05). No changes of the examined parameters were observed after prednisolone. In conclusion, inhibition of IL-1 activity by anakinra reduces apoptotic markers leading to improved LV performance in RA."

This 1-year clinical study among 297 women aged 50-80 years old showed that a vitamin D(3) dose of 6,500 IU/day was not better than the standard dose of 800 IU/day in improving bone mineral density (BMD) in the hip and spine.
INTRODUCTION: the purpose of this study was to determine whether a high dose of vitamin D(3) was better than the standard dose in improving BMD and reducing bone turnover in postmenopausal women with reduced bone mass.
METHODS: the study was a 1-year randomized double-blind controlled trial comparing high-dose vitamin D(3) with the standard dose. Postmenopausal women (n = 297) with a BMD T-score ‚â§ -2.0 in either lumbar spine (L2-4) or total hip were included and randomized to 6,500 IU vitamin D(3)/day (20,000 IU twice per week + 800 IU/day) or 800 IU vitamin D(3)/day (placebo twice per week + 800 IU/day). Both groups were given 1,000 mg elemental calcium/day. The primary endpoint was a change in BMD in total hip and lumbar spine (L2-4).
RESULTS: after 1 year, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) increased [mean (SD)] from 71 (23) to 185 (34) nmol/l and from 71 (22) to 89 (17) nmol/l in the high- and standard-dose vitamin D groups, respectively. BMD at all measurement sites was unchanged or slightly improved with no significant differences between the groups. Although bone turnover was reduced in both groups, the more pronounced reduction in serum levels of the bone formation marker P1NP in the standard-dose group may indicate that this treatment was more efficient. Adverse events did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: one year treatment with 6,500 IU vitamin D(3)/day was not better than 800 IU/day regarding BMD in vitamin D-replete postmenopausal women with reduced bone mass and was less efficient in reducing bone turnover."

METHODS: In our phase II randomized double-blind double-dummy study, patients naive to methotrexate (MTX; n = 201) and having moderate to severe RA received either CH-1504 (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, or 1.0 mg once-daily oral doses) or MTX (titrated to 20.0 mg once-weekly oral doses). All received weekly 10-mg folate supplementation. Efficacy and safety were assessed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, with a treatment-free followup at 16 weeks. Safety and tolerability were assessed. Primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of patients achieving ACR20 response at Week 12. Secondary endpoints included difference from baseline in the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and individual components of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) composite index.
RESULTS: Demographic characteristics were similar in all treatment groups: mean age 54.3 ¬± 11.4 years, female sex 87%, mean baseline DAS28 6.6 ¬± 0.9. At Week 12, CH-1504 demonstrated comparable efficacy compared to MTX as measured by ACR20, DAS28, and ACR composite core-set measures, including tender and swollen joints. No dose-response relationship was observed. Adverse events across treatment groups were mild. Liver enzyme levels increased from baseline to Week 16 in the MTX group, with qualitatively lesser increases in the CH-1504 groups. Two patients in the MTX group withdrew because of gastrointestinal-related adverse events. CH-1504 appeared safe and well tolerated at all dose levels.
CONCLUSION: CH-1504 has comparable efficacy to MTX and is safe and well tolerated. Metabolically stable antifolates are a promising therapeutic option that warrants further study."

Besides, blood samples from 9 healthy persons were taken AS normal controls. Pbmcs were isolated from blood using lymphozytes separation medium, and total protein in the cells was extracted through immobilized ph gradient two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. After coomassie brilliant blue G250 staining, gel-image analysis was performed using pdquest software. The differentially expressed proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Then partial proteins were validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: the 2-DE protein profile of pbmcs from healthy persons and RA patients before and 3 months after treatment were obtained, and 23 differential protein spots were found, 14 from 18 differential protein spots were successfully identified, of which 8 proteins were up-regulated and 6 proteins were down-regulated in RA patients AS compared with control. After 3-month treatment, 5 differentially expressed proteins showed more obvious in the BZXD group than in the MTX group. RT-PCR verified that the expression of apoa-i in all the three groups was consistent with the outcomes of 2-DE.

METHODS: seventy-six RA patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, 37 in the treated group received the combined therapy, and the 39 received MTX treatment alone, all were treated for 12 weeks. Efficacy of treatment was evaluated adopting the standard of american college of rheumatology (ACR), taking ACR20 AS the chief criterion; ACR50, ACR70 AS well AS the clinical indexes and items in health account questionnaire (HAQ) AS the auxiliary criteria, including joint swelling index, joint tenderness index, holding power, morning stiffness time, resting pain, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), c-reactive protein. And the adverse reaction was recorded at the same time. RESULTS: after being treated for 4, 8 and 12 weeks, the ACR20 response rate reached 35.14%, 59.46% and 70.27% respectively in patients of the treated group, while that in the control group was 17.95%, 35.90% and 46.15% respectively, significant difference between groups was shown in the outcome of week 8 and 12 (P < 0.05). ACR50 and ACR70 improving rate at all the time points of observation were increased in the treated group, with the ACR50 improving rate at week 12 higher than that in the control group (43.24% vs. 20.51%, p < 0.05). AS compared with the control group, the improvements in all the auxiliary criteria were more significant in the treated group (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reaction was less in the treated group than in the control group (32.43% vs. 56.41%, p < 0.05), particularly in term of the damage on liver (0 vs. 10.26%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CDC combined with MTX is more effective than MTX alone in treating active RA with less adverse reaction."

METHODS: one hundred patients with RA were randomly assigned to 2 groups, the control group and the treated group, 50 in each group. All were treated with oral administration of methotrexate (MTX,7.5 mg per week), sulfasalazine (0.5 g, tid) and meloxicam (mobic, 7.5 mg, bid), but to the treated group WJR was given additionally. The therapeutic course for both groups was 3 months. Clinical effect, changes of symptoms and physical signs, dosages of western medicines used, and laboratory indices in 2 groups after treatment were observed, and cases of relapse 3 months after treatment were figured out. RESULTS: the total effective rate in the treated group was higher than that in the control group (88.0% vs 76.0%, P<0.05). The improvements in scores of symptoms and signs , and in levels of laboratory indices (tnf-alpha, il-1beta, anti-ccp, RF, ESR, CRP, PLT and ig) in the treated group after treatment were significantly superior to those in the control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

A total of 40 patients who was recently diagnosed as having RA were equally assigned to two groups: the routine treatment group (group R) and the routine treatment plus simvastatin group (group R+S). Twenty healthy individuals served as control. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated before and 4 weeks after the treatment and then cultured with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulatory factor (GM-CSF) to prepare mature DCs. The expression of co-stimulating factor CD86 on the surface of DCs was assessed by flow cytometry. And the stimulating capacity of DCs was measured by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The contents of cytokines in culture supernatants of DCs in MLR were detected by ELISA. Blood lipids and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were detected. The relationship between the expression of CD86 and the blood CRP level was also investigated. The results showed that, as compared with the control group, the CD86 expression and the level of cytokines secreted by DCs were significantly increased in RA patients and greater stimulating capacity of DCs in MLR was demonstrated in RA patients. T lymphocytes in MLR secreted higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-17, TNF-Œ± and INF-Œ≥) and lower level of anti-inflammation cytokine (IL-10). The function of DCs was markedly weakened and the level of hs-CRP and low-density lipoprotein was substantially lowered in group R+S in comparison to group R. The CD86 expression was positively correlated with hs-CRP. It was concluded that DCs in RA are highly activated and DC-initiated immune reaction may play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA. Simvastatin administration can significantly inhibit the DCs function and reduce the level of hs-CRP, indicating the suppression on inflammatory reaction may be one of the mechanisms by which simvastatin exerts its effect in treating RA."

Can hip resurfacing give similar results for patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Using an international hip resurfacing register, 47 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were identified and age and gender matched to a group of 131 randomly selected patients with osteoarthritis of the hip joint. Patients completed a questionnaire to record function and implant revision. Hierarchical regression, Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier method were used for analysis. There was a significant increase in post operative hip score in both groups (p<0.001) with rheumatoid group scoring higher as compared to the osteoarthritis group (p=0.23). The post operative score was not significantly influenced by pre-operative score and age (p=0.15 and 0.84, respectively) but the preoperative score was a predictor of implant failure (p=0.02). Patient mobility was affected by age with younger patients scoring high on mobility as compared to older patients (p= 0.01). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a survival rate of 96.3% in the rheumatoid group and 97.8% in the osteoarthritis group. This difference was not significant (Log rank test, p=0.45). Our results from an independent and international register show that hip resurfacing provides good postoperative hip function and excellent implant survival for patients with rheumatoid arthritis of the hip joint.

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of rituximab (RTX) in combination with methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after failure of a single tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor. Changes in patient-reported outcomes after primary treatment or retreatment with RTX and factors determining retreatment in clinical practice were also evaluated. Methods. In this phase 3b open-label, multicenter trial, patients received 2 slow infusions of RTX 1000 mg 14 days apart after premedication (primary treatment). Patients with a clinically relevant response could receive retreatment between 24 and 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was evaluation of safety. Secondary outcomes were safety of retreatment, effectiveness of primary treatment and retreatment, and changes in patient-reported outcomes after primary treatment or retreatment. Results. Of 120 patients enrolled at 36 centers and receiving primary RTX treatment, 77 received retreatment, 112 completed the 24-week primary treatment period, and 25 completed the 48-week primary treatment and retreatment period following a single course of RTX. The most common adverse events were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, and headache. No infections or infusion reactions were considered life-threatening. At 24 weeks, 58%, 27%, and 7% of patients achieved American College of Rheumatology 20, 50, and 70 improvements, respectively, and similar improvements were seen after retreatment. Conclusion. RTX was well tolerated, with a low incidence of infusion reactions and infections. Efficacy results, including enhanced response in rheumatoid factor-positive patients, were comparable to those reported in the literature. Based on its efficacy and safety profile and retreatment schedule, RTX is an attractive treatment option for patients that have not responded to a single TNF-alpha inhibitor.

Heart rate variability studies showed that fibromyalgia patients have changes consistent with ongoing sympathetic hyperactivity. Norepinephrine-evoked pain test is used to assess sympathetically maintained pain syndromes. Our objective was to define if fibromyalgia patients have norepinephrine-evoked pain. Methods: Prospective double blind controlled study. Participants: Twenty FM patients, and two age/sex matched control groups; 20 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 20 healthy controls. Ten micrograms of norepinephrine diluted in 0.1 ml of saline solution were injected in a forearm. The contrasting substance, 0.1 ml of saline solution alone, was injected in the opposite forearm. Maximum local pain elicited during the 5 minutes post-injection was graded on a visual analog scale (VAS). Norepinephrine-evoked pain was diagnosed when norepinephrine injection induced greater pain than placebo injection. Intensity of norepinephrine-evoked pain was calculated as the difference between norepinephrine minus placebo-induced VAS scores. Results: Norepinephrine-evoked pain was seen in 80% of FM patients (95% confidence intervals 56.3 - 94.3%), in 30% of rheumatoid arthritis patients and in 30% of healthy controls (95% confidence intervals 11.9 - 54.3) (p < 0.05). Intensity of norepinephrine-evoked pain was greater in FM patients (mean + SD 2.5 + 2.5) when compared to rheumatoid arthritis patients (0.3 + 0.7), and healthy controls (0.3 + 0.8) p < 0.0001. Conclusions: Fibromyalgia patients have norepinephrine-evoked pain. This finding supports the hypothesis that fibromyalgia may be a sympathetically maintained pain syndrome."

While some patients may have an inadequate response to methotrexate and to other immunosuppressive drugs, others do not tolerate them. In these patients tumor necrosis factor inhibitors such as etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab are indicated. Multicentric and randomized studies have shown that etanercept is efficacious in disease control, reaching best effects within the first three months of therapy with sustained clinical improvement up to two years of continuous treatment. There are no published controlled studies involving children receiving infliximab and adalimumab, but their effects seem to be similar to that of etanercept. These drugs are relatively safe but it may be observed infectious complications, including tuberculosis and herpes zoster. Autoimmune events, lymphoproliferative disorders and other adverse reactions such as headache and abdominal pain barely occur. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that despite overall beneficial effects of TNF inhibitors, their long term effects remain undefined and therefore indications must be criterious. In addition, the high cost of these drugs limits their use, specially in our country."

Methods are still evolving in the use of mechanistic, e.g., indirect response (IDR) models to relate discrete endpoints, mostly of the ordered categorical form, to placebo/co-medication effect and drug exposure. When the discrete endpoint is derived using change-from-baseline measurements, a mechanistic exposure-response modeling approach requires adjustment to maintain appropriate interpretation. This manuscript describes a new modeling method that integrates a latent-variable representation of IDR models with standard logistic regression. The new method also extends to general link functions that cover probit regression or continuous clinical endpoint modeling. Compared to an earlier latent variable approach that constrained the baseline probability of response to be 0, placebo effect parameters in the new model formulation are more readily interpretable and can be separately estimated from placebo data, thus allowing convenient and robust model estimation. A general inherent connection of some latent variable representations with baseline-normalized standard IDR models is derived. For describing clinical response endpoints, Type I and Type III IDR models are shown to be equivalent, therefore there are only three identifiable IDR models. This approach was applied to data from two phase III clinical trials of intravenously administered golimumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, where 20, 50, and 70 % improvement in the American College of Rheumatology disease severity criteria were used as efficacy endpoints. Likelihood profiling and visual predictive checks showed reasonable parameter estimation precision and model performance.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Our secondary objective was to assess the changes in handgrip strength and disease activity. This randomized, parallel, single-blinded 6-week intervention study enrolled 52 female patients between 40 and 70 years of age, who were diagnosed with RA according to American College of Rheumatology criteria, had disease duration of at least 1 year and had a stage 1-3 disease according to Steinbrocker's functional evaluation scale. Patients were randomized into isotonics and isometrics groups. Exercises were performed on sixth week. All patients were applied wax therapy in the first 2 weeks. Their pain was assessed with visual analog scale (VAS), their hand functions with Duru√∂z Hand Index (DHI), dexterity with nine hole peg test (NHPT) and quality of life with Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life questionnaire (RAQoL). Dominant and non-dominant handgrip strengths (HS) were measured. Disease activity was determined by disease activity score (DAS 28). We evaluated the difference in the above parameters between baseline and 6 weeks by Wilcoxon paired t test. The study was completed with 47 patients (isotonics n = 23; isometrics n = 24). VAS, DHI, NHPT, and RAQoL scores significantly improved in both groups by the end of 6th week compared to the baseline scores of the study (for isotonics p = 0.036, p = 0.002; p = 0.0001, p = 0.003; for isometrics p = 0.021, p = 0.002, p = 0.005, p = 0.01, respectively).

The variables such as mean platelet volume, platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin have been used in the demonstration of the platelet activation. However, when the literature was reviewed, there was not found any study investigating the level of beta-thromboglobulin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Our goal is to evaluate the beta-thromboglobulin levels together with mean platelet volume in patients with arthritis. This study is a clinical study which has a control group that has been designed prospectively, and in this study, Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic follow-up patients with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy control group were studied. All patients and healthy volunteers were examined beta-thromboglobulin and mean platelet volume. Twenty-two patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 21 healthy volunteers participated in the study. beta-Thromboglobulin mean was found as 98.00 + 60.49 ng/mL in rheumatoid arthritis group and it was 62.38 + 30.41 ng/mL in healthy control group. The differences between these groups were significant in terms of the levels of beta-thromboglobulin (p = 0.02). We found significant differences between the groups in terms of mean platelet volume (p = 0.049). In this study, the level of beta-thromboglobulin was found significantly higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease. This result could be an indicator, such as platelet activation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, or it may be a helper marker in the follow-up and treatment of developing cardiovascular risk.  2012 Springer-Verlag."
9260915,,10.2147/dddt.s12139,"Background and aims: Oral bisphosphonates have been used successfully in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but their use for the treatment of corticosteroid induced osteoporosis may be limited by poor compliance. Neridronate, an intramuscular and intravenous aminobisphosphonate approved for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta and Paget's disease, is also effective in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to compare the adherence of intramuscular neridronate versus oral alendronate or risedronate in patients with RA with corticosteroid-induced osteopenia. Methods: This randomised, open label, parallel-group, single centre study enrolled post-menopausal women (50-70 years), with RA and osteopenia (T-score >-2.5) who were receiving stable dose of methylprednisolone 5 mg or equivalent within the previous 3 months, and expected to continue therapy for at least 12 months. Patients were treated with intramuscular neridronate 25 mg administered once a month, or oral alendronate 70 mg or oral risedronate 35 mg both administered once-weekly, for 12 months. The main outcome measure was adherence to treatment over 1 year, assessed using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale 4-item (MMAS-4; adherence defined as patients with MMAS-4 score >3). Results: Of 87 women (mean age 61.5 + 9.2 years) enrolled, 30 were randomized to neridronate, 27 to alendronate and 30 to risedronate therapy. Adherence rates after 12 months were significantly higher with neridronate than with alendronate or risedronate (76.7% vs 47.8% and 48.0%; p<0.05 for both versus neridronate). After 12 months, lumbar and femoral neck BMD and DAS28 were significantly improved in all groups compared with baseline (p<0.05) with no significant difference between the three treatment groups. Conclusion: Neridronate is associated with significantly improved adherence to therapy compared with alendronate and risedronate, and improves BMD and disease activity in postmenopausal women with RA and osteopenia. Intramuscular monthly neridronate represents a convenient treatment option for patients with RA using corticosteroids.  Mattioli 1885."

METHODS: A total of 66 pSS patients were randomized with tossing coins method into two groups: the integrative therapy group (34 cases) and the control group (32 cases); and 28 healthy subjects were taken as the normal group. The integrative therapy group was treated by Chinese herbal medicines for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood combined with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and the control group was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. The treatment course was 3 months for both groups. The levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), IFN-Œ≥ and IL-4 in peripheral blood were measured before and after treatment.
RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the levels of IgG, ESR, IFN-Œ≥ and IL-4 were significantly increased in pSS patients (P<0.05). Remarkably, after 3 months of treatment, these levels were dramatically decreased in both the integrative therapy group and the control group, although still higher than the normal group. The levels of IgG, ESR, IFN-Œ≥ and IL-4 in the integrative therapy group were lower than the control group and the same group before treatment (P<0.05). The ratio of IFN-Œ≥/IL-4 also significantly decreased after treatment. Moreover, the level of IFN-Œ≥ and the ratio of IFN-Œ≥/IL-4 in the integrative therapy group were significantly lower than the control group (P<0.05). For all patients the ratio of IFN-Œ≥/IL-4 before and after treatment was positive correlated with the levels of IgG and ESR.
CONCLUSION: Chinese herbal medicine for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood can alleviate the disease activity of pSS by regulating the immune balance of Th1/Th2."

This has not been assessed in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Our objective was to examine changes in cortical hand bone density in patients with PsA treated with placebo or infliximab (IFX).
METHODS: Patients in IMPACT II (Induction and Maintenance Psoriatic Arthritis Clinical Trial 2) were randomized to placebo or IFX. After Week 24, all received IFX. In a subset of 120 patients, cortical hand bone density was assessed at Weeks 0, 24, and 54 by digital X-ray radiogrammetry (dxr-BMD) on the same radiographs scored for joint damage.
RESULTS: Changes from baseline to 24 weeks in dxr-BMD were -0.30% (SD 1.1%) in the placebo group and -0.08% (SD 1.4%) in the IFX group (p = 0.63). Between baseline and 54 weeks the changes were -0.71% (SD 2.1%) in the placebo group and 0.15% (SD 1.7%) in the IFX group (p = 0.07), and between 24 and 54 weeks -0.41% (SD 1.4%) and 0.23% (SD 0.8%), respectively (p = 0.05). No significant correlation was found between change in dxr-BMD and radiographic damage.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study indicates that hand bone loss in PsA patients treated with anti-TNF can be arrested. Assessment of hand bone density may thus be a potential outcome measure for bone involvement and a response variable to treatment in PsA."

Open-label studies and clinical experience in Japan have suggested that this electric field therapy is safe and effective in treating chronic arthritis. We evaluated the efficacy of EF-HVAC therapy in a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled trial in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in community-based general physician centers. Thirty patients fulfilling American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA were treated with EF-HVAC therapy with the LEGACIS PLUS System (COCOROCA Corp., Tokyo, Japan) or sham therapy for 12 weeks and followed for 4 weeks without treatment. The disease activity score 28 (DAS28-CRP), visual analogue scale for pain (VAS), modified health assessment questionnaire (MHAQ), and inflammatory parameters were used as the outcome variable. Twenty four patients (n = 12 in each group) were analyzed by a per protocol analysis. Although a significant reduction in DAS28-CRP was observed in EF-HVAC group at 8 and 12 weeks compared to before treatment, there were no significant differences in DAS28-CRP scores during treatment between two groups. The scale of VAS was also significantly decreased by the treatment with EF-HVAC compared to before treatment, in addition, the scale of VAS in EF-HVAC group was significantly lower than sham group at 8 and 12 weeks. Changes in another parameters including MHAQ were not significant between before and after treatment, or by all comparative study between two groups.

Secondary objectives included characterizing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
METHODS: In this single-blind, phase I/II study, 35 patients with RA were randomized in 5 cohorts to receive a single subcutaneous (SC) ofatumumab dose ranging from 0.3 to 100 mg, or placebo, following premedication with oral acetaminophen and antihistamine. Patients were followed for 24 weeks with extended followup to monitor B cell and immunoglobulin recovery for up to 2 years if required.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients received the following treatment: 0.3 mg, n = 4; 3 mg, n = 6; 30 mg, n = 8; 60 mg, n = 6; 100 mg, n = 3; placebo, n = 8. The most common adverse events in the combined ofatumumab groups were headache, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infection. Because of tolerability concerns, only 3 patients were given 100 mg. For the 30-100 mg doses, median maximum plasma concentration values ranged from 4.02 to 4.49 days. Mean elimination half-life values ranged from 5.20 to 6.83 days. Increasing peripheral median B cell depletion was observed from 0.3 mg up to 30 mg, and full target B cell depletion was achieved with 30 mg, 60 mg, and 100 mg.

METHODS: one hundred and thirty-eight patients with RA were randomly assigned to group I (44 cases, treated by BQC), group II (46 cases, treated by MTX), and group III (48 cases, treated by BQC combined with MTX). The therapeutic course for each group was 12 weeks. The degree of joint pain, the tender joint number, the tender joint index, the swollen joint number, the swollen joint index, the two-hand grip, the morning stiffness time, and related laboratory indices were observed in each group before and after treatment. The adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: compared with before treatment, there was statistical difference in the degree of joint pain, the tender joint number, the tender joint index, the swollen joint number, the swollen joint index, the two-hand grip, the morning stiffness time, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), c-reactive protein (CRP), and rheumatoid factor (RF) in the 3 groups (P < 0.05, p < 0.01).

CONCLUSIONS: BQC showed favorable effects on treating RA with no obvious adverse reaction. BQC combined with MTX showed better clinical efficacy than use of BQC or MTX alone. It could reduce the adverse reactions of MTX. BQC combined with MTX could reduce the toxic reactions and enhance the therapeutic effects, indicating it was an effective treatment program for RA."
9260949,,10.1186/1745-6215-14-253,"BACKGROUND: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that leads to joint damage, deformity, and pain. It affects approximately 1% of adults in developed countries. Periodontitis is a chronic oral infection, caused by inflammatory reactions to gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, and affecting about 35 to 50% of adults. If left untreated, periodontitis can lead to tooth loss. A significant association has been shown to exist between periodontitis and RA in observational studies. Some intervention studies have suggested that periodontal treatment can reduce serum inflammatory biomarkers such AS c-reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. We hypothesize that periodontitis could BE an aggravating factor in patients with RA, and that its treatment would improve RA outcomes. The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the effect of periodontal treatment on the biological and clinical parameters of patients with RA. METHODS/DESIGN: the ESPERA (experimental study of periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis) study is an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects with both RA and periodontitis will BE recruited at two university hospitals in southwestern france. In total, 40 subjects will BE randomized into two arms (intervention and control groups), and will BE followed up for 3 months. Intervention will consist of full-mouth supra-gingival and sub-gingival non-surgical scaling and root planing, followed by systemic antibiotic therapy, local antiseptics, and oral hygiene instructions. After the 3-month follow-up period, the same intervention will BE applied to the subjects randomized to the control group.the primary outcome will BE change of in disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) at the end of the follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will BE the percentages of subjects with 20%, 50%, and 70% improvement in disease according to the american college of rheumatology criteria. Health-related quality of life assessments (the health assessment questionnaire and the geriatric oral health assessment index) will also BE compared between the two groups. DISCUSSION: evidence-based management of potential aggravating factors in subjects with active RA could BE of clinical importance, yet there are few randomized controlled trials on the effect of periodontal treatment on the clinical parameters of RA. The ESPERA trial is designed to determine if non-surgical periodontal treatment could improve clinical outcomes in patients with active RA, and the quality of life of these patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: the ESPERA trial was registered in current controlled trials  on 2012/03/20. The trial started recruiting on 2012/03/06."

More research is needed to evaluate interventions aiming to facilitate beneficial long-term change. We propose to evaluate the effect of Alexander Technique lessons and acupuncture in a rigorously conducted pragmatic trial with an embedded qualitative study.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will recruit 500 patients who have been diagnosed with neck pain in primary care, who have continued to experience neck pain for at least three months with 28% minimum cut-off score on the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ). We will exclude patients with serious underlying pathology, prior cervical spine surgery, history of psychosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoporosis, haemophilia, cancer, HIV or hepatitis, or with alcohol or drug dependency currently or in the last 12 months, or actively pursuing compensation or with pending litigation.The York Trials Unit will randomly allocate participants using a secure computer-based system. We will use block randomisation with allocation to each intervention arm being unambiguously concealed from anyone who might subvert the randomisation process.Participants will be randomised in equal proportions to Alexander Technique lessons, acupuncture or usual care alone. Twenty 30-minute Alexander Technique lessons will be provided by teachers registered with the Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique and twelve 50-minute sessions of acupuncture will be provided by acupuncturists registered with the British Acupuncture Council. All participants will continue to receive usual GP care.The primary outcome will be the NPQ at 12 months, with the secondary time point at 6 months, and an area-under-curve analysis will include 3, 6 and 12 month time-points. Adverse events will be documented. Potential intervention effect modifiers and mediators to be explored include: self-efficacy, stress management, and the incorporation of practitioner advice about self-care and lifestyle. Qualitative material will be used to address issues of safety, acceptability and factors that impact on longer term outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide robust evidence on whether there are significant clinical benefits to patients, economic benefits demonstrating value for money, and sufficient levels of acceptability and safety.

9260957,,10.1371/journal.pone.0063215,"BACKGROUND: Variability exists in the assessment of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients that may affect quality of care.
OBJECTIVES: To measure the impact on quality of care of a Multi-Biomarker Disease Activity (MBDA) test that quantitatively assesses RA disease activity.
METHODS: Board-certified rheumatologists without prior experience with the MBDA test (N‚Ää=‚Ää81) were randomized into an intervention or control group as part of a longitudinal randomized-control study. All physicians were asked to care for three simulated RA patients, using Clinical Performance and Value (CPV‚Ñ¢) vignettes, in a before and after design. CPV‚Ñ¢ vignettes have been validated to assess the quality of clinical practice and identify variation in care. The vignettes covered all domains of a regular patient visit; scores were determined as a percentage of explicit predefined criteria completed. Three vignettes, representing typical RA cases, were administered each round. In the first round, no physician received information about the MBDA test. In the second round, only physicians in the intervention group were given educational materials about the test and hypothetical test results for each of the simulated patients. The outcome measures were the overall quality of care, disease assessment and treatment.
RESULTS: The overall quality scores in the intervention group improved by 3 percent (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.02) post-intervention compared with baseline, versus no change in the control group. The greatest benefit in the intervention group was to the quality of disease activity assessment and treatment decisions, which improved by 12 percent (p<0.01) compared with no significant change in the control group. The intervention was associated with more appropriate use of biologic and/or combination DMARDs in the co-morbidity case type (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, use of the MBDA test improved the assessment and treatment decisions for simulated cases of RA and may prove useful for rheumatologists in clinical practice."

It is in development as an anti-inflammatory drug in different therapeutic areas. Clinical studies have shown that losmapimod is well tolerated and safe in humans and several studies have shown its pharmacological effect in the target diseases. The aim of this work was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model and to explore the covariates affecting the pharmacokinetics of losmapimod using data collected from healthy volunteers and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The plasma concentration data were pooled from four of the losmapimod clinical studies, with 30 healthy subjects, 23 subjects with RA and 24 subjects with COPD. Non-linear mixed-effects modelling was used to build a base model to characterize the structure and describe the variability of the pharmacokinetics of losmapimod. The available demographic covariates were explored to further explain the inter-subject variability. New data generated from another RA study with 34 subjects were used to validate the final model. All modelling was conducted using NONMEM(¬Æ) VI.
RESULTS: A two-compartment model with first-order elimination and time-dependent first-order absorption was found to best fit the concentration-time profiles of losmapimod following oral administration. The first phase of the absorption was more variable than the second phase for most of the subjects in the dataset. There was no apparent difference in the structure of the pharmacokinetic model among healthy subjects and patients with RA and COPD. A slightly higher residual error was associated with COPD patients compared with the healthy and RA subjects. Three demographic covariates, namely sex, age and bodyweight, were retained in the final model to explain the inter-individual variability on pharmacokinetic parameters apparent total oral clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment (V(1)) and the first-order absorption rate constant (k(a)). Most of the fixed effect parameters (Œ∏(pop,j) and Œ∏ for covariate) of the final model were estimated with good precision (% relative standard error [RSE] ‚â§30 %). The inter-individual variability was precisely estimated (%RSE ‚â§30 %) for clearance and k(a), but less precise for inter-compartmental clearance and volumes of distribution. The mean clearance following oral administration of losmapimod was approximately 31.2 L/h (95 % CI 27.7-35.2) for males and 24.6 L/h (95 % CI 22.1-27.3) in females.
CONCLUSION: The population pharmacokinetic model described in this work well characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of losmapimod following administration of a single oral dose and repeated oral doses in healthy subjects and patients with RA and COPD. Although sex, bodyweight and age were significant factors influencing some pharmacokinetic parameters of losmapimod, the relatively small magnitude of the effect did not result in concerns for dose adjustment."

The effectiveness of exercise for RA hands is uncertain, although evidence from small scale studies is promising. The Strengthening And Stretching for Rheumatoid Arthritis of the Hand (SARAH) trial is a pragmatic, multi-centre randomised controlled trial evaluating the clinical and cost effectiveness of adding an optimised exercise programme for hands and upper limbs to best practice usual care for patients with RA.
METHODS/DESIGN: 480 participants with problematic RA hands will be recruited through 17 NHS trusts. Treatments will be provided by physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Participants will be individually randomised to receive either best practice usual care (joint protection advice, general exercise advice, functional splinting and assistive devices) or best practice usual care supplemented with an individualised exercise programme of strengthening and stretching exercises. The study assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation and will follow participants up at four and 12 months. The primary outcome measure is the Hand function subscale of the Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire, and secondary outcomes include hand and wrist impairment measures, quality of life, and resource use. Economic and qualitative studies will also be carried out in parallel.
DISCUSSION: this paper describes the design and development of a trial protocol of a complex intervention study based in therapy out-patient departments. The findings will provide evidence to support or refute the use of an optimised exercise programme for RA of the hand in addition to best practice usual care."

9260990,,10.3899/jrheum.120597,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an educational intervention could result in changes in physicians' practice behavior.
METHODS: Twenty rheumatologists performed a prospective chart audit of 50 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and again after 6 months. Ten were randomized to the educational intervention: monthly Web-based conferences on the value of systematic assessments in RA, recent evidence-based information, practice efficiency, and other topics; this group also read articles on targeting care in RA. The others were randomized to no intervention.
RESULTS: One thousand serial RA charts were audited at baseline and 1000 at 6 months, with no between-group differences in patient characteristics: mean disease duration of 10 years; 77% women; 74% rheumatoid factor- positive; mean Disease Activity Score (DAS) 3.7; and 68% taking methotrexate, 14% taking steroids, and 27% taking biologics. At 6 months the intervention group collected more global assessments (patient global 53% preintervention vs 66% postintervention, and MD global 51% vs 60%; p < 0.05) and Health Assessment Questionnaires (37% vs 42%; p > 0.05; p = nonsignificant), whereas controls had no change in outcomes collected. For the intervention group there was a 32% increase in calculable composite scores [such as DAS, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index; p < 0.05] but no change in the controls. There was more targeting to a low disease state. For those with SDAI between 3.3 and 11, the percentage of patients receiving a change in therapy was 66% in the intervention group and 36% in controls (p < 0.05). When DAS was between 2.4 and 3.6, 57% of the intervention group and 38% of controls made changes to treatment (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Small-group learning with feedback from practice audits is an inexpensive way to improve outcomes in RA."

Low-dose glucocorticoid therapy alleviates disease signs and symptoms, is better tolerated than high-dose therapy, and its addition to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) inhibits radiographic disease progression. A low-dose, modifiedrelease (MR) formulation of prednisone, administered in the evening, was developed to counter the circadian rise in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels that contributes to disease activity. In a 12-week, randomized trial (CAPRA-2) in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving stable DMARD therapy, the addition of MR prednisone reduced disease signs and symptoms by >20 % according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria (in 48 % of patients vs. 29 % with placebo; p<0.002 [primary endpoint]). In another 12-week trial (CAPRA-1), addition of evening MR prednisone to stable DMARD therapy reduced the mean duration of morning stiffness to a greater extent than addition of morning immediate-release (IR) prednisone (22.7 vs. 0.4 %; p = 0.045 [primary endpoint]). The improvement in morning stiffness with MR prednisone was maintained for 9-12 months during the open-label extension of CAPRA-1. These findings were supported by data from observational studies in various adult populations with rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with evening MR prednisone for up to 12 months was generally well tolerated, with an overall similar tolerability profile compared with evening placebo or morning IR prednisone, and no new safety concerns. MR prednisone was estimated to be cost effective relative to IR prednisone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in a UK pharmacoeconomic model.  Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013."

Whereas non-pharmacological interventions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have been shown to reduce pain and fatigue, no randomized controlled trials have examined the effect of non-pharmacological interventions on improvement of sleep in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an intermittent aerobic exercise intervention on sleep, assessed both objectively and subjectively in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods/design. A randomized controlled trial including 44 patients with rheumatoid arthritis randomly assigned to an exercise training intervention or to a control group. The intervention consists of 18 session intermittent aerobic exercise training on a bicycle ergometer three times a week. Patients are evaluated according to objective changes in sleep as measured by polysomnography (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include changes in subjective sleep quality and sleep disturbances, fatigue, pain, depressive symptoms, physical function, health-related quality of life and cardiorespiratory fitness. Discussion. This trial will provide evidence of the effect of intermittent aerobic exercise on the improvement of sleep in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which is considered important in promotion of health and well-being. As such, the trial meets a currently unmet need for the provision of non-pharmacological treatment initiatives of poor sleep in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Trial registration.

Methods: Two non-overlapping parallel 8-item forms from each of three PROMIS domains (physical function, fatigue, and depression) were completed by 923 adults (age 18-89) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, or rheumatoid arthritis. In a randomized crossover design, subjects answered one form by interactive voice response (IVR) technology, paper questionnaire (PQ), personal digital assistant (PDA), or personal computer (PC) on the Internet, and a second form by PC, in the same administration. Structural invariance, equivalence of item responses, and measurement precision were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory methods. Results: Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis supported equivalence of factor structure across MOA. Analyses by item response theory found no differences in item location parameters and strongly supported the equivalence of scores across MOA. Conclusions: We found no statistically or clinically significant differences in score levels in IVR, PQ, or PDA administration as compared to PC.

9261016,,10.3899/jrheum.131503,"Objective. To determine the elapsed time while receiving aggressive therapy to the first observation of clinically inactive disease (CID), total duration of CID and potential predictors of this response in a cohort of children with recent onset of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (poly-JIA). Methods. Eighty-five children were randomized blindly to methotrexate (MTX), etanercept, and rapidly tapered prednisolone (MEP) or MTX monotherapy and assessed for CID over 1 year of treatment. Patients who failed to achieve intermediary endpoints were switched to open-label MEP treatment. Results. Fifty-eight (68.2%) of the 85 patients achieved CID at 1 or more visits including 18 who received blinded MEP, 11 while receiving MTX monotherapy, and 29 while receiving open-label MEP. Patients starting on MEP achieved CID earlier and had more study days in CID compared to those starting MTX, but the differences were not significantly different. Patients given MEP (more aggressive therapy) earlier in the disease course were statistically more likely to have a higher proportion of followup visits in CID than those with longer disease course at baseline. Those who achieved American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 70 response at 4 months had a significantly greater proportion of followup visits in CID, compared to those who failed to achieve this improvement (p < 0.0001). Of the 32 patients who met criteria for CID and then lost CID status, only 3 fulfilled the definition of disease flare. Conclusion. Shorter disease duration prior to treatment, a robust response at 4 months, and more aggressive therapy result in a higher likelihood and longer duration of CID in patients with poly-JIA. The original trial from which data for this analysis were obtained is registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT 00443430"

This multicentre randomised controlled trial aimed to determine whether preformed foot orthoses (FOs) impacted on pain and quality of life (QoL) in children with JIA. Methods: Eligible children were randomised to receive either 'fitted ' FOs with customised chair-side corrections or 'control' FOs made without corrections. Changes in pain and QoL were measured using a visual analogue scale and Paediatric Quality of Life questionnaire, respectively. JIA children were assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Results: 60 children were recruited. 179 out of a possible 180 assessments (99.4%) were completed. A statistically significant greater difference in pain reduction (baseline - 6 months) was seen between the two groups favouring fitted FOs (p=0.029). The reduction in pain in the fitted FOs group was clinically important (8 mm). Significant differences in QoL favouring fitted FOs were also identi fied as measured by the children and independently by their parents/carers. Conclusions: Fitted FOs may reduce pain and improve QoL in selected children with JIA. Trial registration number: NCT02001844."

This study is aimed to investigate the effects of balneotherapy and aquatherapy in the treatment of RA patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 59 patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for RA were included this study. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups. Group 1 (n=20) received balneotherapy, group 2 (n=20) received an aquatic exercise program and group 3 (n=19) was accepted as control group. These programs were applied five times a week, over three weeks (15 sessions). Patients were evaluated for clinical and laboratory parameters. Clinical parameters included pain,duration of morning stiffness, number of swollen and tender joints, disease activity score (DAS28), Modified health assessment questionnaire (mHAQ), physician's and patient's global assessment and hand grip strength. Laboratory evaluation included erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The assessment parameters were measured before, at the end of and after 3 months of the therapy. Results: The mean age of the patients was 54+10.7 (25-75) years and the mean disease duration was 122.3+98.1 (1-424) months. In aquatic exercise group we observed an improvement in DAS28 scores (p<0.001), in the number of tender joints (p<0.005), in VAS scores (p<0.005), mHAQ (p<0.05), physician's and patient's global assessments (p<0.05). Also there was a statistically significant decrease in ESR results in aquatherapy group compared to other groups (p<0.05). However no statistically significant difference was obtained between three groups (p>0.05). Conclusion: This study shows that aquatic exercise program is beneficial in the management of DAS28, pain, HAQ parameters and should be taken in to consideration in planning exercise therapy for RA patients."

A fixed-dose combination of enteric-coated (EC) naproxen and immediate-release esomeprazole magnesium (NAP/ESO) has been designed to deliver a proton-pump inhibitor followed by an NSAID in a single tablet. To examine safety data from 5 Phase III studies of NAP/ESO in LDA users (‚â§ 325 mg daily, administered at any time during the study), and LDA non-users, data were analyzed from 6-month studies assessing NAP/ESO versus EC naproxen in patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis (n = 2), 3-month studies assessing NAP/ESO vs celecoxib or placebo in patients with knee osteoarthritis (n = 2), and a 12-month, open-label, safety study of NAP/ESO (n = 1). In an analysis of two studies, incidences of endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers (GUs) and duodenal ulcers (DUs) were summarized by LDA subgroups. In the pooled analysis from all five studies, incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (including prespecified NSAID-associated upper GI AEs and cardiovascular AEs), serious AEs, and AE-related discontinuations were stratified by LDA subgroups. Overall, 2,317 patients received treatment; 1,157 patients received NAP/ESO and, of these, 298 received LDA. The cumulative incidence of GUs and DUs in the two studies with 6-month follow-up was lower for NAP/ESO vs EC naproxen in both LDA subgroups [GUs: 3.0 vs 27.9%, respectively, for LDA users, 6.4 vs 22.4%, respectively, for LDA non-users (both P < 0.001); DUs: 1.0 vs 5.8% for LDA users, 0.6 vs 5.3% for LDA non-users]. The incidence of erosive gastritis was lower in NAP/ESO- vs EC naproxen-treated patients for both LDA users [18.2 vs 36.5%, respectively (P = 0.004)] and LDA non-users [19.8 vs 38.5%, respectively (P < 0.001)]. Among LDA users, incidences of NSAID-associated upper GI AEs were: NAP/ESO, 16.1%; EC naproxen, 31.7%; celecoxib, 22.1%; placebo, 23.2%. Among LDA non-users, incidences of NSAID-associated upper GI AEs were: NAP/ESO, 20. %; EC naproxen, 36.6%; celecoxib, 18.5%; placebo, 18.9%. For LDA users, incidences of cardiovascular AEs were: NAP/ESO, 3.0%; EC naproxen, 1.0%; celecoxib, 0%; placebo, 0%. For LDA non-users, incidences of cardiovascular AEs were: NAP/ESO, 1.0%; EC naproxen, 0.6%; celecoxib, 0.3%; placebo, 0%. NAP/ESO appears to be well-tolerated in patients receiving concomitant LDA. For LDA users, AE incidence was less than that observed for EC naproxen. For most AE categories, incidences were similar among NAP/ESO, celecoxib and placebo groups. The safety of NAP/ESO appeared similar regardless of LDA use."

Most treatments for OA, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics, induce adverse side effects, supporting the search for effective, but safer treatments. Green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) extracts (GME) have been useful for managing OA. D-002, a mixture of beeswax alcohols, has been shown to ameliorate experimental OA and to reduce OA symptoms. This study investigated whether administering D-002 together with GME may improve the efficacy of GME on OA symptoms. Subjects with OA symptoms were double-blindly randomized to GME capsules (50 mg of the extract/capsule) + placebo or D-002 (50 mg) tablets for 6 weeks. Symptoms were assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Individual Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the visual analogy scale (VAS) scores. The primary outcome was the significant reduction of total WOMAC score versus GME + placebo. WOMAC pain, joint stiffness and physical function scores, VAS score and use of rescue medications were secondary outcomes. All randomized participants (50) completed the study. Both treatments reduced significantly the total WOMAC score, pain and physical function WOMAC sub-scores, and VAS score versus baseline, but the values achieved with GME + D-002 were lower than with GME + placebo, so that GME + D-002 decreased significantly the total WOMAC score, pain and physical function WOMAC sub-scores, and VAS as compared to GME + placebo. Only one subject (treated with GME + placebo) consumed rescue medications. Treatments were well tolerated. This study demonstrates that D-002 (50 mg/day) co-administered with GME for 6 weeks, improved GME efficacy for relieving arthritic symptoms and was well tolerated."

Methods: In an incident-user cohort of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients with upper gastrointestinal complications celecoxib or traditional NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen) use, we (1) aggregated medications and International Classification of Diseases- 9 diagnoses into hierarchies of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification (ATC) and the Clinical Classification Software (CCS), respectively, and (2) sampled the full cohort using techniques validated by simulations to create 9,600 samples to compare 16 aggregation scenarios across 50% and 20% samples with varying outcome incidence and exposure prevalence. We applied hd-PS to estimate relative risks (RR) using five dimensions, predefined confounders, < 500 hd-PS covariates, and propensity score deciles. For each scenario, we calculated: (1) the geometric mean RR; (2) the difference between the scenario mean ln(RR) and the ln(RR) from published randomized controlled trials (RCT); and (3) the proportional difference in the degree of estimated confounding between that scenario and the base scenario (no aggregation). Results: Aggregations of medications into ATC level 4 alone or in combination with aggregation of diagnoses into CCS level 1 improved the hd-PS confounding adjustment in most scenarios, reducing residual confounding compared with the RCT findings by up to 19%. Conclusions: Aggregation of codes using hierarchical coding systems may improve the performance of the hd-PS to control for confounders in some research settings.

Materials-Methods: Patients were randomized into isotonic (Group 1, n=23) and isometric (Group 2, n=24) exercise groups. Exercises were performed in the hospital under the supervision of a physiotherapist once a day with 10 repetitions for the first two weeks. Patients continued exercises at home between the 3th and 6th weeks. Their pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS), their hand functions were assessed using the Duruoz Hand Index (DHI), dexterity by nine hole peg test (NHPT), and quality of life using Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life questionnaire (RAQoL). Dominant and non-dominant HS were measured. Disease activity was determined by disease activity score (DAS 28).

A reason could be lack of awareness regarding the disease and the benefits of compliance. The primary objective of this prospective 24 weeks controlled study was to assess the impact of RA disease and management related education on adherence to recommended follow ups and compliance with medications. Methods: At two centres 122 consecutive adult patients with RA were randomized into two groups; group A, n=64 received dedicated 10 min education and counseling using audio-visual aids regarding RA at the first consultation which was followed by another reinforcement session at the first follow up visit at 4 weeks, group B, n=58 was given only standard information regarding RA during the first consultation. Both groups received printed articles in Malayalam (local language) and English regarding autoimmune diseases including RA. Non compliance to follow ups and drugs were recorded. Results: There was no significant difference in the age, proportion of female patients, disease duration, baseline disability and disease activity between the two groups. Majority of patients in both groups had secondary education or more. The compliance both with follow ups (cumulative 88% vs 72%, P=0.038) and medications (at 12 and 24 weeks 100% vs 90%, P=0.026 and 98% and 82%, P=0.011, respectively) was significantly higher in the group A.

RTX retreatment was offered to all pts based on physician's decision of clinical need, including assessment of active disease. Pts receiving placebo during placebo-controlled study periods were pooled to provide a placebo population. Results: As of September 2009, 3189 pts had been treated with RTX, for a total exposure of 9342 pt-years (yrs). The analysis contained >9 yrs of follow-up with up to 15 courses of RTX. Over 1500 pts were followed for >3 yrs and 587 pts for >5 yrs, with 1724, 1392, 1036 and 656 pts receiving >3, >4, >5 and >6 courses, respectively. The safety profile of RTX was comparable to the placebo population or general RA populations, with the exception of infusion-related reactions (IRR). The most frequent adverse event (AE) in RTX patients was IRR; most were CTC grade 1 or 2 and occurred after the first infusion of the first course (23%), with 0.5% considered serious (over all courses). Generally, rates of serious AEs and infections remained stable over time and over multiple RTX courses, and in pts in long-term follow-up (>5 yrs). Similar overall rates of serious infection were observed between RTX and placebo populations [4.35 (3.19 in >5 yrs follow-up) vs. 4.29 events/100 pt-yrs, respectively]. Lower respiratory tract infections were the most frequent serious infections, with pneumonia being predominant (2%). Serious opportunistic infections were rare, with a rate comparable to the placebo population (0.04 vs. 0.01/100 pt-yrs, respectively). Myocardial infarction and stroke rates in the RTX group (0.49 and 0.25 events/100 pt-yrs, respectively) were consistent with rates in the general RA population (0.34-0.59 and 0.112-0.76 events/100 pt-yrs, respectively). Conclusions: Data from long-term follow-up of RA pts treated with RTX in clinical trials indicate that RTX continued to be well tolerated over time and over multiple courses, with safety profiles similar to that of the placebo population and consistent with published data on pts with moderate-tosevere RA. No new safety signals were observed in both the all-exposed population and the >5 yrs exposure group."
9261117,,10.1007/s00198-012-2073-z,"Background/Purpose: To describe effects on bone mineral density (BMD) of treatment according to EULAR guidelines with a methotrexatebased tight control strategy including 10 mg prednisone daily versus the same strategy without prednisone in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, who received preventive therapy for osteoporosis. Methods: Early RA patients were included in the CAMERA-II trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind two-year trial, in which effects of addition of 10 mg prednisone daily to a methotrexate-based tight control strategy were studied. All patients received calcium, and a bisphosphonate. Disease activity was assessed every four weeks. X-rays of hands and feet and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of lumbar spine and left hip were performed at baseline, and after one and two years of treatment. Results: The BMD increased significantly over time in both treatment groups at the lumbar spine with a mean of 2.6 percent during the first year (p < 0.001), but not at the hip; at none of the time points the BMD differed significantly between the prednisone and placebo group. Higher age and lower weight at baseline, and higher disease activity scores during the trial, but not glucocorticoid therapy, were associated with a lower BMD at both the lumbar spine and the hip in mixed model analyses. Conclusion: Addition of 10 mg prednisone daily to a methotrexate-based tight control strategy does not lead to bone loss in early RA patients on bisphosphonates. A small increase in lumbar BMD during the first year of treatment was found, regardless of the use of glucocorticoids."
9261130,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/ar4347/fulltext.html,10.1186/ar4347,"Background/Purpose: The cytokine IL-17A is an innate inflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of several human autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Brodalumab is a human, immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to human IL 17RA and blocks the biological activity of IL 17A, IL-17F, IL-17A/F heterodimers, and IL-25. Increased levels of IL-17A have been detected in the synovial fluid of patients with RA and furthermore, blockade of IL-17A signaling can inhibit osteoclast formation induced by culture media of RA synovial tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of brodalumab in subjects with moderate to severe RA. Methods: This phase Ib, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multiple ascending dose study enrolled subjects with a moderate to severe RA (>6/66 swollen and >8/68 tender joints). Subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive multiple doses of brodalumab (50mg, 140mg or 210mg subcutaneously every two weeks for 6 doses, or 420mg or 700mg intravenously every 4 weeks for two doses) or placebo. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability of brodalumab, including incidence of adverse events (AEs). Multiple dose pharmacokinetics was a secondary endpoint. Exploratory endpoints included pharmacodynamics, and improvements in RA clinical metrics. Assessments were performed up to end of study on day 127. Results: 40 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose; there was one dropout on day 85 due to worsening RA (placebo). Treatment with brodalumab resulted in receptor occupancy by brodalumab on circulating leukocytes and inhibition of IL-17 receptor signaling. Dose-dependent increases in the magnitude and duration of mean receptor occupancy were observed. Treatment-related AEs were reported by 3 (30.0%) of 10 placebo subjects and 7 (23.0%) of 30 brodalumab subjects. The most common treatment-related adverse event was headache (20%) for placebo subjects and leukocytosis (7%) for brodalumab subjects. Serious AEs occurred in 2 subjects during the study [complicated migraine (placebo) and non-cardiac chest pain (brodalumab, 420 mg IV)]; neither was considered by the investigator related to investigational product. On day 85 (week 13) ACR20 was achieved by 11 (36.7%) of 30 subjects receiving brodalumab and 2 (22.0%) of 9 subjects receiving placebo. Few ACR50 or ACR70 responses were observed in either active or placebo group at day 85. Conclusion: This small ascending dose phase 1b study demonstrates that multiple dose administration of brodalumab was tolerated in subjects with active RA. Conclusions about efficacy cannot be reached given the study design."

Canakinumab is a selective, fully human, anti-IL-1beta monoclonal antibody. Two pivotal phase 3 trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients (pts) with active sJIA with fever. Methods: Pts aged 2-19 yrs with active sJIA (fever, >2 active joints, C-reactive protein >30 mg/L) with inadequate response to standard of care treatments (NSAIDs, steroids, MTX) were enrolled. Trial 1 was a 4-wk, double-blind, single-dose study of pts randomized to subcutaneous (SQ) canakinumab 4 mg/kg or placebo. Trial 2 enrolled 177 pts, including eligible pts rolling over from Trial 1. In Part I of Trial 2, pts received open-label (OL) canakinumab 4 mg/kg/4wks SQ for up to 32 wks. Pts with an adapted ACR Pediatric 30 criteria response (aACR-Ped30) at the end of Part I entered Part II after randomization 1:1 to continue canakinumab or receive placebo until 37 flare events occurred. The primary endpoint of Trial 1 was the proportion of aACR-Ped30 responders at Day 15. The primary endpoint of Trial 2 in Part I was the proportion of steroid-treated pts at entry who successfully tapered steroids, and in Part II the time to flare. Pts withdrawn due to protocol-driven discontinuation rules were offered participation in the currently on-going OL long-term extension study. Results: In Trial 1, 84 pts (canakinumab n=43; placebo, n=41) were enrolled. At Day 15, of the 84 pts, significantly more pts in the canakinumab group (83.7% [36/43]) vs. the placebo group (9.8% [4/41]) achieved an aACR-Ped30 response (P <0.0001). In Trial 2, 177 pts received canakinumab in Part I 100 of whom were randomized in Part II (canakinumab, n=50; placebo, n=50) and 77 discontinued. During Part I of Trial 2, 44.5% (57/128) of the steroid-treated pts successfully tapered steroids (P <0.0001), with the mean steroid dose lowered to 0.05 mg/kg/d from 0.34 mg/kg/d. Of note 32.8% (42/128) of the pts stopped steroids completely. In Part II, the median time to flare on placebo was 236 days vs. not observed with canakinumab, corresponding to a statistically significant 63% relative risk reduction of flares (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.78; P=0.0043). Inactive disease was achieved by 30.9% (54/175) of the canakinumab-treated pts at the end of Part I and 62% (31/50) upon completion of Part II. 142 (80.2%) of the enrolled pts from Trial 2 entered the OL extension study, which included 48 pts who had withdrawn from the Part I due to efficacy related protocol-driven discontinuation. In both trials, infections were the most common type of adverse event (AE) reported. Most Serious AEs were associated with infections, disease flare, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS, n=7, including 2 on placebo). Two deaths were reported (1 canakinumab 1 placebo), both associated with MAS. Conclusion: These data support that canakinumab is an effective treatment for active sJIA with fever. Canakinumab demonstrated superior efficacy vs. placebo, allowed successful reduction of steroid use, and significantly decreased the risk of sJIA flares, while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile."

TCZ, an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist, was evaluated for treatment of pcJIA and extended oligoarticular JIA in the Phase 3 CHERISH study. This analysis reports PK, PD, and exposure-response relationships for 16-wk data (part 1 lead-in period). METHODS: 188 pcJIA pts were randomized 1:1 to TCZ 10 mg/ kg (group 1) or 8 mg/kg (group 2) if body weight (BW) was <30 kg or allocated to TCZ 8 mg/kg if BW was >30 kg (group 3); all administration was by IV infusion every 4 wks. PK samples were collected for 16 wks before and after infusion for population PK analysis. PK exposure parameters were estimated for the wk 12-16 dosing interval. PK efficacy and PK safety relationships were explored. RESULTS: 32, 30, and 115 pts were available for analysis in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Mean+SD age was 6.9+3.1, 7.7+2.6, and 13.1+2.8 y, and mean+SD BW was 20.6+5.8, 22.4+5.3, and 49.3+12.1 kg in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For groups 1, 2 and 3, mean+SD AUC4wks, Cmin, and Cmaxat wk 12 were 968+254, 702+218, and 1231+361 mug.d/mL; 2.35+3.59, 0.95+2.07, and 7.49+8.20 mug/ mL; and 175+32, 140+25, and 182+37 mug/mL, respectively. PD data (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, and soluble IL-6R) and efficacy outcomes (JIA ACR50/70 and JADAS-27 change from baseline) showed that the 10-mg/kg dose in pts with BW <30 kg and the 8-mg/kg dose in pts with BW >30 kg achieved comparable responses. Analysis of JIA ACR responses by PK exposure quartiles further illustrated that lower PK exposure resulted in lower clinical efficacy. Analysis of adverse event (AE) rates/100 pt-y by PK exposure quartile showed no consistent trend of increased AE rates with increased PK exposure. CONCLUSION: These data show that in pcJIA pts, TCZ 10 mg/ kg in pts with BW <30 kg provided more comparable exposure to 8 mg/kg in pts with BW >30 kg than did 8 mg/kg in pts with BW <30 kg. Exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety support the BW-based dosing regimens."

Methods: Adult RA patients (n=237) on MTX were randomized equally to receive monthly s.c injections of secukinumab 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300mg or placebo. After wk16, responders on secukinumab remained on the same dose whereas doses were escalated in nonresponders at wk20 (except patients initially on 300mg who remained on the same dose). All placebo patients were switched to secukinumab 150 mg. Patients were followed up to wk52. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 at wk16. Results: Demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable across all groups. At wk16 ACR20 responders were higher with secukinumab 75 mg, 150mg and 300mg vs placebo (47%, 47% and 54% vs. 36%) but did not reach statistical significance. Responders on secukinumab at wk 16 maintained their ACR responses through wk52; for the 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300mg cohorts ACR20 responses were 67%, 57%, 90% and 71%, respectively. Highest responses in ACR50/ 70 responses at wk24 and wk52 were seen in patients who remained on secukinumab 150mg for the entire study (wk24: ACR50=50%, ACR70=20%; wk52: ACR50=55%, ACR70=40%). DAS28-CRP reductions were sustained up to wk52 in responders on secukinumab 150mg along with improvement in HAQ scores (-0.6=wk24 vs -0.8=wk52) and EULAR remission rates (DAS28-CRP<2.6: 30%= wk24 vs 40%=wk52). Non-responders did not gain much additional efficacy benefit after dose escalation as assessed by ACR20/50/70 and DAS28-CRP. The overall rates of AEs from wk20 - 60 were comparable to those observed up to wk20 (60-70%) and most AEs were mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to study discontinuation. Between wk 20 - 60 the rate of infections was 31.9% with six infections reported as SAEs. A total of 28 SAEs were reported in 21 patients. In this period, three malignancies and no deaths were reported. Conclusions: The primary efficacy endpoint was not achieved in this study. ACR20 responders at wk16 showed sustained improvement of efficacy through wk52 with highest efficacy in patients who remained on 150mg throughout the study. DAS28-CRP and HAQ scores improved through week 52 in responders who remained on secukinumab 150 mg. There were no safety signals with secukinumab related to specific organ class and the rate and frequency of AEs remained stable over time with no unexpected safety findings."

Consequently, TNF-alpha inhibition may be hypothesized to be an effective treatment of this condition. Adalimumab and other TNF-alpha inhibitors are already used successfully in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory joint diseases. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of TNF-alpha blockade with subcutaneous adalimumab compared with intra-articular steroid injections on pain and range of motion of patients with frozen shoulder. An additional aim was to assess the safety of adalimumab in the treatment of frozen shoulder. Methods: We compared the effect of subcutaneous adalimumab injections with intra-articular glucocorticoid injections on frozen shoulder in 18 patients with unilateral joint involvement. Ten patients were randomized to subcutaneous injections with adalimumab and eight to intraarticular glucocorticoid injections administered every other week for a total of three administrations. The patients were evaluated on the day of injection (weeks 0, 2, and 4) and at weeks 8, 12, and 24. The evaluation included assessment of the Constant shoulder score, shoulder pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS), the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), and the Shoulder Rating Questionnaire (SRQ) score. Results: An overall statistically significant difference between the time points was found for all tests in the glucocorticoid group (p < 0.05 to p = 0.0001). When comparing the different tests pairwise in this group, most of the scores had improved significantly compared to week 0 (p < 0.05). However, no consistent trend towards a persistent improvement in the scores during follow-up was found. In the adalimumab group, no overall difference between the test results at different time points was demonstrated and no consistent pattern was observed when comparing the tests pairwise. Baseline values for active and passive flexion were significantly lower in the adalimumab group than in the glucocorticoid group. No significant differences between the adalimumab- and glucocorticoid-treated group were found for any other time points. Conclusions: No effect of subcutaneous injections of adalimumab on frozen shoulder symptoms was demonstrated. Intra-articular glucocorticoids seemed to have some effect over time, but not to a significant degree compared to adalimumab."

Objective: To compare effects of 6-week isotonic and isometric hand exercises on pain, hand functions, dexterity and quality of life in patients with RA. Materials and methods: Fifty-two women with rheumatoid arthritis for at least 1 year were enrolled. Patients were randomized into isotonic (group 1) and isometric (group 2) exercise groups. Exercises were performed at the hospital under the supervision of a physiotherapist once a day with 10 repetitions for the first two weeks. Patients continued exercises at home between 3 and 6 weeks and were called every first day of the week to check whether they regularly performed their exercises and encouraged to do so. Dominant ve non-dominant hand grip strengths (GS) were measured with Jamar dynamometer. Their pain was assessed with visual analogue scale (VAS), hand functions with Duruoz Hand Index (DHI), dexterity with nine hole peg test (NHPT), and quality of life with Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life questionnaire (RAQoL) at the baseline and at the end of 6th week by another physician blind to exercise group. Results: The study was completed with 47 patients. Mean age and disease duration for group 1 (n = 23) were 54.91 + 9.27 years and 10.65 + 7.64 years, and for group 2 (n = 24) were 50.38 + 9.32 and 8.17 + 6.51 years, respectively.

Group 2 showed a significant increase in dominant hand GS and group 1 showed a significant increase in non-dominant hand GS (P < 0.05). VAS, DHI, NHPT, and RAQoL scores were significantly improved in both groups at the 6th week compared to the baseline score of the study (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Patients with RA benefitted from 6 week isotonic or isometric hand exercise program with regards to decrease in pain, increase in hand function, dexterity and quality of life."

Methods: RA patients with prior long-term MTX treatment (n=457) were randomized to receive fostamatinib (150 mg qd [n=152]/100 mg bid [n=152]) or pbo (n=153), and background MTX. Patients self-administered the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) patient-reported outcomes (PRO) core set: pain (visual analog scale [VAS]); patient's global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity [VAS]; and physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index [HAQ-DI]) at baseline, Week (Wk) 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. HRQL (Short Form-36 [SF-36]) was assessed at baseline and Wk24, and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue [FACIT-Fatigue]) was assessed at baseline, Wk12, and 24. The main analyses compared the mean changes from baseline between the treatment groups using a generalized linear model. A responder analysis of the proportion of patients achieving a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in each treatment group used the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test. All tests of statistical significance were 2-sided; a=0.05. Results: The study population had a duration of RA in excess of 8 years.1 ACR responder rates were significant with fostamatinib 100 mg bid vs pbo (ACR20: 67% vs 35%; ACR50: 43% vs 19%; p<=0.001). Fostamatinib 100 mg bid significantly improved pain, PtGA, and physical function at Wk1 vs pbo (p<=0.001), and was sustained throughout the trial (24 wks) (Table). Also, by Wk24, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving fostamatinib 100 mg bid achieved MCID for pain, PtGA, and physical function vs pbo (73.3% vs 62.0%[p<0.05] for pain; 74.0% vs 55.4%[p<=0.01] for PtGA; 74.8% vs 55.8%[p<=0.01]) for physical function). A significant improvement in the SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) was seen with fostamatinib 100 mg bid vs pbo at Wk24 (p<=0.001, including for each SF-36 physical domain), as well as for fatigue (p<0.05) but not for the SF-36 mental component summary (Table). Moreover, at Wk24, a significantly greater proportion of patients (achieved the SF-36 PCS MCID with fostamatinib 100 mg bid vs pbo (72.9% vs 57.6%; p<=0.01) and a numerically greater percentage for fatigue (59.8% vs 48.6%; p>=0.05).

The rate of infections was 31.9% overall. Twenty one (9.7%) SAEs were reported including 6 cases of serious infections without dose relationship. There were 3 malignancies and no deaths up to Week 52. Conclusion: The primary efficacy endpoint was not achieved in this trial possibly due to an unexplained increase in ACR20 in the placebo group between weeks 12 (24%) and 16 (36%). However, ACR20-responders at Week 16 experienced maintenance or improvement of efficacy through Week 52 with highest efficacy in patients who remained on 150mg throughout the trial. Patients on secukinumab who were non-responders at Week 16 did not gain much additional efficacy benefit after dose escalation. Secukinumab was well tolerated and the rate and frequency of AEs remained stable over time without unexpected safety findings."

Methods: this was a 12-mth Phase II/III double-blind study in pts with active ISN/RPS Class III or IV LN, requiring: urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) >=0.44 mg/mg (50 mg/mmoL); active urinary sediment (>5 red blood cells [RBC]/high power field [hpf] or >8 white blood cells/hpf or cylindruria); and renal biopsy within 3 mths (if biopsy 3-12 mths, abnormal C3, C4 or anti-dsDNA also required). All pts received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; target dose 1.5-3.0 g/day dependent on race) and up to 60 mg/day prednisone or equivalent (with response-guided taper after 28 days). Pts were randomized to placebo (PBO) or IV ABA (either 3 mths of ABA 30 mg/kg followed by 9 mths of 10 mg/kg [30/10], or 12 mths of 10 mg/kg [10/10]). The primary efficacy endpoint was time to Complete Renal Response (CRR: GFR within 10% of pre-flare/screening value; UPCR <0.26 mg/mg [30 mg/mmol]; inactive urinary sediment) confirmed at 30 days after the first response, compared using a Cox proportional hazards model. Secondary endpoints included time to Renal Improvement (RI) and Mth 12 rates of CRR and RI (RI: >=50% UPCR reduction, GFR >=50% improved if screening 15-59, otherwise >=90% of screening; no active sediment). Exploratory endpoints included 1) Patient Response (PR: UPCR <0.5 mg/mg [56.5 mg/mmol] or >=50% UPCR improvement to <1.0 mg/mg [113 mg/mmol] if baseline <=3.0 mg/mg [339 mg/mmol] or to 3.0 mg/mg if baseline >3.0; RBCs within reference range (<5-8/hpf) or >=50% reduction; serum creatinine normal or <=25% above baseline) and 2) Renal Response (RR: serum creatinine <=25% above baseline; >=50% UPCR improvement to <1.0 mg/mg if baseline <=3.0 or to <3.0 mg/mg if baseline >3.0). Safety was assessed. Results: of 298 treated pts, 228 (76.5%) completed Mth 12 (78.0, 74.7, and 76.8% in PBO, ABA 10/10, and ABA 30/10). Time to CRR did not differ between groups (p=0.549 and 0.422) for ABA 10/10 and 30/10 vs PBO) nor did time to RI. Efficacy at Mth 12 is shown (Table). A subset analysis of 122 nephrotic pts (baseline UPCR >3.0 mg/mg) found ~20-30% greater reduction in UPCR in pts randomized to ABA vs PBO from Mth 6, maintained to Mth 12. Safety is reported (Table). Cause of death appeared to be underlying disease for 5 pts and infection for 7. (Table presented) Conclusion: aBA, MMF and steroids exhibited a safety profile similar to MMF and steroids in pts with LN. Pre-specified efficacy endpoints did not demonstrate a benefit at 12 mths for ABA vs PBO. Among nephrotic pts, an exploratory analysis showed improvement in proteinuria with ABA, suggesting that additional exploration may be warranted to investigate potential biologic activity in this subset"

This first in-human study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics of RCT-18 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study in 28 RA patients. Eligible patients were randomized 3:1 to receive single subcutaneous doses of RCT-18 (1.2, 6, 18, 60, 180, 360, 540¬†mg) or placebo. A 71-day observation period was scheduled for each patient, during which serial blood sampling for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity assessments was performed. Safety was assessed throughout the study.
RESULTS: RCT-18 was well tolerated, although mild infections and skin irritation occurred more frequently in patients receiving this drug. After single-dose RCT-18, the maximal serum concentration (C max) of total and free RCT-18 was reached within 1-2¬†days, followed by a multi-exponential decline. Mean elimination half-life for total RCT-18 and free RCT-18 was 5.7-12.8¬†days and 3.2-11.3¬†days at 6-60¬†mg, and 15.1-17.5¬†days and 18.8-36.8¬†days with 180-540¬†mg RCT-18. The formation and elimination of BLyS-RCT-18 complex were much slower, with a time to C max of 5-29¬†days and the elimination half-life mounting from 13.3 to 32.8¬†days with dose escalation. No positive reaction was detected in the immunogenicity assessments. Substantial IgM reduction was only evidenced with 540¬†mg RCT-18, while the response profiles of IgM/IgG were distinguishable from placebo after 180, 360, or 540¬†mg RCT-18.
CONCLUSION: RCT-18 was safe and well tolerated up to 540-mg single doses. The serum exposure of total and free RCT-18 is linearly correlated to the weight-normalized doses of RCT-18 in dose groups receiving 180-540¬†mg RCT-18. The elimination half-life of BLyS-RCT-18 increased with RCT-18 doses, suggesting a shift from target-mediated disposition in 1.2-18¬†mg RCT-18 groups to non-specific clearance in 60-540¬†mg RCT-18 groups. Assuming the concentration of BLyS-RCT-18 complex and the IgM/IgG ratio are surrogate biomarkers for clinical effects of RCT-18, the dose-response relationship suggests 180-540¬†mg are pharmacodynamically effective doses in RCT-18 for RA patients, but the effect profile of 540¬†mg RCT-18 on IgM is similar to that of atacicept at pharmacodynamically effective but clinically ineffective doses."

Large proportions of patients with RA are overweight or obese, and exhibit poor cardio-respiratory fitness and reduced muscle strength. These factors have been associated with poor function and increased mortality. A less well studied but important co-morbidity that affects RA patients is cognitive impairment, which can have a negative impact on patients' ability to manage their disease. We aimed to investigate the effects of a specifically designed exercise programme on body composition, aerobic capacity, muscle strength and cognition in RA patients. Methods: Sixty-six patients with RA were randomised on a 1:1, case: control ratio. Assessments included body composition (waist circumference), fitness (VO2max), muscle strength (hand-grip) and cognitive testing (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), in addition to disease related measures. Patients in the intervention group were enrolled for a three-month exercise programme. The control group received standard care. Results: Twenty-eight cases and 24 controls attended for baseline testing. Seven patients were subsequently lost to follow up (4 cases and 3 controls). There were significant improvements in several measured outcomes in the intervention group compared to controls after three months. Median waist circumference was significantly reduced in cases, with median value 94.0 cm (range 67.3-124.5) at 0 months, compared to 91.4 cm (range 66.0-124.5) at 3 months, (2.8% reduction, p< 0.0001). Aerobic capacity, as measured by VO2max, for cases was 23.2 ml/kg/min at 0 months compared to 27.6 ml/kg/min at 3 months (19% increase, p=0.002). Median right grip strength was 12kg (0-23) at 0 months, compared to 13kg (0-30) at 3 months (8.3% increase, p=0.025). For left grip strength, the median value was 8kg (0-20) at 0 months, compared to 10kg (0-32) at 3 months (25% increase, p=0.005). There was a significant improvement in cognitive function for cases, with median Montreal Cognitive Assessment value 25.5 (20-30) at 0 months compared to 28.0 (22-30) at 3 months (10% increase, p=0.001). There was also a significant reduction in C-reactive protein (median 2.8, range 1.0-27.4 at 0 months compared to 1.9, 1.0-18.4, at 3 months, equating to a reduction of 32.1%, p=0.025). Fatigue scores, measured by Global Fatigue Index were reduced from median 13.2 (range 6.4-34.1) at 0 months, to 10.9 (6.5-37.5) at 3 months (p=0.047). There was a significant reduction in trunk fat at 3 months (median 37.3, range 16.3-56.9) compared to 36.2, range 16.3-56.5 (p=0.004). For all above measures, there was no significant difference in median control values at 3 months. Conclusion: There are significant benefits associated with physical activity for both general health and RA-related parameters, as evidence by the current data. This study has demonstrated for the first time that exercise has a significant impact on cognitive function in RA. We can conclude that physical activity is safe and effective in RA patients and should be a vital component of management protocols."

Besides permanent work disability and sick leave, at-work productivity is often impacted by RA. It was shown that reduced at-work productivity has the greatest impact on costs for RA patients, followed by wage loss from stopping or changing jobs, decreased hours, and finally missed work days (absenteeism). At-work productivity decreases when a person is present at work, but is limited in meeting work demands. The Care for Work intervention program is a multidisciplinary intervention with the aim to improve at-work productivity. The intervention program consists of integrated care, coordinated by a clinical occupational physician, and a participatory workplace intervention, coordinated by an occupational therapist. The intervention was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which includes 113 participants. Objectives: To determine the effects of the intervention program on work productivity, work instability, and supervisor support after 6 months of follow up in workers with rheumatoid arthritis compared to usual care. Methods: This study is an RCT. Participants were RA patients who are involved in paid work for at least 8 hours per week, recruited from outpatient clinics of rheumatology. Outcome measures were at-work productivity (measured with the Work Limitations Questionnaire, a higher score indicates more limitations at work), work instability (measured with the RAWIS, a higher score indicates more work instability), and supervisor support (measured with the subscale Supervisor Support of the Job Content Questionnaire, a higher score indicates more supervisor support). Data were analyzed using linear regression models according to the intention-to-treat principle. Results: The intervention program did not show an effect on at-work productivity (B: 0.328, 95% CI -0.560 - 1.217), work instability (B: -0.697, 95% CI -2.05 - 0.66), and supervisor support (B: 0.10, 95% CI -0.12 - 0.32). Conclusion: The intervention program did not show beneficial effects on at-work productivity, work instability and supervisor support after 6 months."
9261259,,10.3899/jrheum.131282,"Introduction: Sleep disturbance and chronic fatigue are common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and contribute to disability, symptomatology and healthcare utilization. It has long been recognised in other populations that exercise can improve sleep and diminish fatigue. The effect of exercise on sleep quality and fatigue in RA has not been evaluated. Aims/background: This is a randomised controlled study in RA to determine the effect on an exercise programme on sleep quality and fatigue. Method: RA patients were randomised to either a 12 week homebased exercise intervention or usual care. The programme consisted of specific exercises to target deficiencies identified using the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) with cardiovascular work as per the guidelines. Full evaluation was carried out at baseline and at 12 weeks. Fatigue was measured using the Fatigue Severity Index. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Forty patients were randomised to the intervention with 38 controls. In the exercise intervention group there was a statistically significant improvement in HAQ, pain, stiffness, and perceptions regarding exercise benefits, sleep quality and fatigue. In our control group there was a statistically significant improvement demonstrated in their overall perceptions of the benefits of exercise but none of the other parameters (Table 1). Conclusions: This is the first study evaluating the effect of exercise on sleep quality and fatigue in RA. It demonstrates clinically important and statistically significant improvements in fatigue, sleep quality, symptomatology and functional disability. This gives further weight to the theory that in RA exercise should be encouraged, prescribed and could have disease modifying properties. (Table presented) ."
9261265,,10.3899/jrheum.131412,"Objective. To determine whether a multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) score predicts radiographic damage progression in the subsequent year in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. Methods. There were 180 serum samples available in the BeSt study (trial numbers NTR262, NTR 265): 91 at baseline (84 with radiographs available) and 89 at 1-year followup (81 with radiographs available). Radiographs were assessed using the Sharp/van der Heijde Score (SvdH). Twelve serum biomarkers were measured to determine MBDA scores using a validated algorithm. Receiver-operating curves and Poisson regression analyses were performed, with Disease Activity Score (DAS) and MBDA score as independent variables, and radiographic progression as dependent variable. Results. At baseline, MBDA scores discriminated more between patients who developed radiographic progression (increase in SvdH > 5 points) and patients who did not [area under the curve (AUC) 0.767, 95% CI 0.639-0.896] than did DAS (AUC 0.521, 95% CI 0.358-0.684). At 1 year, MBDA score had an AUC of 0.691 (95% CI 0.453-0.929) and DAS had an AUC of 0.649 (95% CI 0.417-0.880). Adjusted for anticitrullinated protein antibody status and DAS, higher MBDA scores were associated with an increased risk for SvdH progression [relative risk (RR) 1.039, 95% CI 1.018-1.059 for baseline MBDA score; 1.037, 95% CI 1.009-1.065 for Year 1 MBDA score]. Categorized high MBDA scores were also correlated with SvdH progression (RR for high MBDA score at baseline 3.7; low or moderate MBDA score as reference). At 1 year, high MBDA score gave a RR of 4.6 compared to low MBDA score. Conclusion. MBDA scores predict radiographic damage progression at baseline and during disease course."

Aims/background: To establish the effectiveness of hydrotherapy in rheumatology patients with chronic pain. Method: Short-term effects of hydrotherapy on fatigue and pain were studied, using the FACIT Fatigue Scale (version 4) and a Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale (current/typical/best/worst pain). Surveys were given to 24 rheumatology inpatients before and after 3 days of hydrotherapy. Patients' diagnoses included osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative disc disease, psoriatic arthritis and lupus. A literary review of existing randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised clinical trials using the Cochrane Library was also carried out. Results: Of the 24 patients a 17 % (p 0.004) reduction in fatigue and a 9 % (p 0.13) reduction in pain was obtained. Randomised control studies showed that a statistically significant improvement in physical function, pain, mental health and quality of life, when compared to a control group but in a 6 month follow-up randomized control trial reporting on this lasting effectiveness, benefits were not shown to last more than 6 months, suggesting that hydrotherapy may be better used on more of a continuum than a once off treatment [1]. Conclusions: In conclusion, hydrotherapy is an excellent base on which to start physiotherapy before commencing land-based programmes and may be continued to preserve improvements seen at the end of initial hydrotherapy. Further studies looking at the longer term impact of hydrotherapy intervention are planned."

Brug of choice is methotrexate (MTX) - cytostatic drug from the group of antimetabolites, folic acid antagonists. According to various authors, about 70% of patients receiving therapy with MTX are in remission for the disease. In 1988, MTX was approved FDA (Food and Drug Administration, USA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Currently, MTX is the main drug in the treatment of JIA. Preferred therapeutic recommendations on the number of MTX based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 1992. MDR1-gene product - the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the protein acts as a transmembrane pump, and affects the activity of many drugs. Polymorphism in the gene MDR1 may affect the pharmacokinetics of many drugs, including anticancer drugs. According to the authors of Jinwei Chen (2011) in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the Chinese population C3435T MDR1 gene polymorphism may be associated with susceptibility to RA, but may influence the effectiveness of antirheumatic therapy of RA, and CC genotype may be associated with immune rheumatoid arthritis (RRA). Objectives: The aim of our study is to determine the effect on the efficiency of the MDR1 gene therapy JIA. Methods: Were examined 103 patients diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (according to the EULAR), receiving standard treatment with methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg/m2 over 3 months (intramuscular). All children were defined P-glycoprotein (the product of the gene MDR1), and C3435T polymorphism of the gene MDR1. A genetic study was carried out using polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction analysis to determine the C3435T polymorphism of the gene MDR1. Modeling inflammation in vitro was carried out by treating the blood with recombinant human interleukin 2, followed by determination of the level of P-glycoprotein (CD243-PE) on peripheral blood lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies by flow cytofluorometry. Results: Among the 103 children included in the study - 65 (63.11%) females and 38 (36.89%) boys with different forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: polyarthritis - 46 children (44.66%), oligoarthritis - 25 children (24, 27%), systemic arthritis - 14 children (13.59%), arthritis entezitassociated - 18 patients (17.48%). Analysis of changes in the level of P-glycoprotein after IL2 stimulation, depending on the genotype of MDR1 gene showed significant differences. When comparing the patients in these groups, it was found that in the group of children with genotype TT, increase P-IL2 protein after stimulation were significantly lower than in children with genotype CT. In patients with genotype TT average sedimentation rate was significantly higher than that of children in the group CT in the acute phase, and in the waning activity of the inflammatory process in the joints. Similar changes were obtained by comparing the genotypes CC + CT and TT. Conclusion: Given the data, we can assume that children with the TT genotype MDR1 gene (C3435T) is worse respond to standard treatment of JIA."

Disease control in these patients is still an unmet challenge. Case reports and a small case control study, suggest a role for interleukin 1 beta blockage, particularly anakinra, in the management of this limitation of colchicines. Objectives: To embark on a study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of anakinra in the treatment of colchicine refractory FMF. Methods: We plan to include patients, agreeing with clinical and genetic diagnosis of FMF, who suffer from FMF attacks, at least once per month, in one of the sites commonly involved by FMF (Chest, abdomen, lower extremity large joints, and skin), despite treatment with colchicine 2 mg/ day or less (in case of colchicine intolerance). Involvement with other diseases relevant (vasculitis, spondyloarthropathy, Behcet's disease, etc.), or irrelevant (rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, etc.), to FMF, or possible non compliance, will serve as exclusion criteria. The study is planned to continue for 4 months per patient, in which patients will receive anakinra (s.c. 100 mg/day, 25 patients), or control drug (anakinra vehicle, same volume, same package, 25 patients). Randomization will be sequential for a predetermined order of the interventional drug (anakinra or vehicle), for which the study team will be blinded. Analysis of the results will be performed by an external company. Anakinra effect will be compared to placebo effect by computing the reduction of number of attacks per each patient. Secondary outcome include reduction of severity of attacks. Results: No results are yet available. The study is an investigator initiative project, with sponsorship of the manufacturing drug company. Measurements were taken to avoid any bias in the performance of the study or interpretation of the results. It is expected that the whole study will continue 2 years. Conclusion: A favorable anakinra effect in the prevention of FMF attacks in colchicine failure, supported by ample case reports is expected to be confirmed by the present controlled double blinded study by mid 2015."

It should be provided by a trained multidisciplinary team of physicians and allied health professionals (AHP). In the traditional model, nursing and physiotherapy staff competencies are limited by the leading role of physicians and support of an equally important role of AHP is not automatically provided. A case for the importance of AHP needs to be presented to the healthcare providers and hospital managers. Objectives: The project has 2 parts: 1.To develop a comprehensive system of therapeutic interventions provided by AHP to paediatric patients with JIA (a subject to this report). 2.To prospectively test performance of these interventions in a cohort of JIA patients with active disease requiring new drug treatment. Methods: Two trained rheumatology nurses and a physiotherapist contributed to the development of an AHP intervention plans as an addon to the routine clinical care. Apart from the published literature the main resources included observations made by the team during their educational visits to the 2 European paediatric rheumatology services (Utrecht, NL, and Birmingham, UK). For the 2nd part of the study patient inclusion criteria were: 1. Active JIA (at least 1 joint with active synovitis). 2. Newly diagnosed, untreated JIA or JIA relapse requiring medical intervention. Performance of interventions was tested by standardized quality of life assessments (CHAQ, parent/patient global assessment, SMILY-illness, JAMAR) along physician-derived disease activity measures (physician global, active joint count, ESR/CRP, JADAS71). Consecutive patients have been randomised into 3 groups according to the frequency of AHP interventions (3 or 6-monthly or no extra AHP intervention). Results: AHP intervention had 2 parts: an interview (about 30-45 min) and a practical session. Nurse interview covered 3 main areas: Introduction of the rheumatology team, patient history (schooling, (Table presented) relationships, hobbies and psychosocial aspects) and education (disease, its treatment, monitoring and parent/patient assessments). Where eligible, practical training in injection technique and drug safety/handling issues was provided. Physiotherapy (PT) interview covered history of pain, functional limitation, school PE, sporting, vocational issues and education on PT management. Practical input included full PT assessment, complex evaluation of physical function and establishment of the PT treatment plan. From November 2013 to May 2014 total of 41 consecutive patients were eligible from which one family refused participation. Polyarticular JIA was present in 19 children, oligoarthritis in 14, psoriatic, enthesitis-related or systemic JIA in 7 patients. There were 24 patients with the new diagnosis of JIA, 16 had JIA relapse. Median age at study entry was 6.5 years (3.7-10.1), prior disease duration was 1.0 year (0.2-3.7). Median active joint count at study entry was 3 (1-6.5), JADAS 71 was 9 (6-18). From 21 patients in whom the first F/U assessment was available, 10 received intraarticular triamcinolone-hexacetonide (in 2 cases with methotrexate, MTX), 6 received s.c. MTX and in 5 patients biologic therapy was added to MTX. Conclusion: With this study we aim to accumulate better evidence on the importance of the trained nursing and physiotherapy staff in the multidisciplinary team caring for rheumatology patients in the country where such an approach is not fully supported by the existing system. Evaluation of the performance of interventions provided by AHP is a subject of ongoing study."

Treatment with canakinumab (CAN), a selective, human, anti-IL-1b monoclonal antibody allows for successful steroid dose reduction/discontinuation and reduces risk to experience a flare in patients with SJIA [1]. CAN is approved for SJIA patients (> 2 years old) by over 30 countries including USA, EU, Russia and Canada. Objectives: To evaluate the maintenance of efficacy with continued CAN treatment in SJIA patients during the blinded randomized treatment withdrawal part of a large phase III trial. Methods: Patients 2-19 yrs of age with active SJIA who had responded to open-label CAN treatment 4mg/kg/4wks sc, maintained a minimum adapted ACR Pediatric criteria [aACR] 30 for up to 32 weeks, and were steroid-free or had successfully reduced systemic steroids to a minimum dose, were randomized to either continue CAN or receive placebo until 37 flare events occurred [1]. Patients were considered to have completed the study if they entered clinical remission on medication (CRM), i.e. achieved 24 consecutive weeks of clinical inactive disease (CID) [2]. A survival analysis of the time to worsening in aACR level, after randomization for the CAN and placebo groups was performed. Time to worsening is the time to fail to maintain at least the same level of aACR response seen at randomization. The change in the proportion in each group of those with CID was also evaluated. Results: 100 pts were randomized to a CAN (n=50) or a placebo (n=50) group, of whom 26 (53%) and 27 (54%), respectively, had CID at the start of the randomization part. In the first 2 months, probability of maintaining aACR response was similar for both treatment groups. Thereafter, the probability of maintaining aACR response was greater in the CAN vs placebo groups. The median time to worsening in aACR level for patients in the placebo group was 141 days (95% CI: 85, 281), and could not be calculated for CAN as <50% of CAN group had a worsening in their aACR level by the end of this phase. The median duration of exposure for the CAN group was 221.5 days (range: 8-617 days). There was a statistically significant relative risk reduction of 51% for the CAN vs placebo group to experience a worsening in aACR level (HR= 0.49; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.90; p=0.0131). CID was achieved by 31(62.0%) vs 17 (34.0%) patients in CAN vs placebo at their last visit (OR= 3.4; 95% CI: 1.5, 8.0; p=0.0020) and CRM was reached by 20 (40%) CAN and 2 (4%) placebo patients by the end of the study. Conclusion: A greater proportion of SJIA patients who continued CAN treatment maintained/improved their aACR response, achieved CID and CRM than patients who discontinued CAN by being switched to placebo, demonstrating maintenance of efficacy with continued CAN treatment over time."

As a result, the management of children with this subtype, which is the most prevalent in Western countries, is largely empiric. Intra-articular corticosteroid (IAC) injection is the therapy of first choice for oligoarthritis in many pediatric rheumatology centers. However, although IAC injections are usually highly efficacious, relapses of synovitis are common and sometimes occur only a few months after the procedure. It is still unclear whether concomitant administration of methotrexate (MTX) may increase and prolong the effectiveness of IAC injections. Objectives: To compare the efficacy of IAC injection administered as monotherapy or in association with MTX in children with oligoarticular JIA in a phase II, randomized, actively controlled, multicenter trial. Methods: Inclusion criteria were oligoarticular JIA by ILAR criteria, age < 18 years, and parent informed consent. Patients who were previously treated with synthetic or biologic DMARDs, had undergone an IAC injection < 3 months, were newly injected only in 1 knee, or had active uveitis were excluded. Patients enrolled were randomized 1:1 to receive either IAC therapy alone (Arm 1) or IAC therapy plus MTX (Arm 2). MTX was given orally at 15 mg/m2/week (maximum 20 mg/week). All patients were followed for 12 months and were assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was synovitis flare, defined as recurrence, persistence or new onset of synovitis in 1 or more injected or uninjected (i.e. previously unaffected) joints. Flare rate/probability was compared by chi-square and Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: A total of 207 patients (50 boys and 157 girls) were enrolled, 102 in Arm 1 and 105 in Arm 2. Fifteen patients lost to follow-up <6 months were included only in the intention-to-treat (ITT) cohort. Patients in arms 1 and 2 were comparable for demographic features and median number of injected joints (2 vs. 2). In the ITT cohort (n=207) flare of synovitis occurred in 133 patients (64.2%), 69 (67.6%) in Arm 1 and 64 (60.9%) in Arm 2 (p=0.31), whereas in the as-observed (AO) cohort (n=192) flare of synovitis occurred in 118 patients (61.4%), 64 (66%) in Arm 1 and 54 (56.8%) in Arm 2 (p=0.19). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the probability of synovitis flare in the 2 treatment arms was comparable in both ITT and AO cohorts (log-Rank test: p=0.18 and 0.07, respectively). However, among the 118 patients who flared in the AO cohort, flare in injected joints occurred more frequently in Arm 1 than in Arm 2 (46/64, 71.9% vs. 29/54, 53.7%; p= 0.04). Conclusion: The association of oral MTX did not increase the overall effectiveness of IAC therapy. However, flare of synovitis in injected joints occurred less frequently in patients who received concomitant MTX."

Objectives: To investigate progression of radiographic joint damage in pts with sjia treated with TCZ for up to 2 years in TENDER. Methods: 112 pts 2-17 yrs old with active, refractory sjia of >6 months' duration and inadequate response to previous non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and oral corticosteroids were enrolled in TENDER. Pts were randomised 2:1 to receive TCZ according to body weight (12 mg/kg <30 kg or 8 mg/kg >30 kg) or placebo IV every 2 wks for 12 wks. Pts then received open-label TCZ in the ongoing long-term extension. Radiographic progression was calculated as change in adapted Sharp/van der Heijde score (ash) score and/or Poznanski score, assessed on hand and wrist radiographs, from baseline to wks 52 and 104. Radiographic progression was indicated by a positive ash score change or negative Poznanski score change. Clinical efficacy endpoints included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Paediatric (Pedi) 70/ 90 responses. Results: Baseline and >1 postbaseline ash and Poznanski scores were available for 47 and 33 pts, respectively (reasons for missing x-rays: early withdrawal, no consent, unreadable x-rays). Baseline characteristics for pts with radiographic data were similar to the whole TCZ population [1]. Pts with assessable ash/Poznanski scores had 5.2/4.8-yr disease duration, 21.3/19.2 active joints, 20.0/18.2 joints with limitation of movement and erythrocyte sedimentation rates of 53.9/59.2 mm/h. At wks 52 and 104, 20 and 19 pts, respectively, had ash progression, and 8 and 6 pts, respectively, had Poznanski score progression. Median change in ash score from baseline to wks 52 and 104 were 0 and 0.5, respectively (Table). Median change in Poznanski score from baseline to wks 52 and 104 were 0.3 and 0.17, respectively (Table 1). Conclusion: Though changes in radiographic scores over time were seen in many pts, on average, pts with sjia did not experience noticeable progression of radiographic damage over 2 yrs of treatment with TCZ."

It causes long-term effects on both physical and quality aspects of a child's life. Adalimumab (ADA) has been previously demonstrated to be effective in polyarticular JIA. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab compared to placebo in children and adolescents with ERA. Methods: This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind (DB) study in patients (pts) aged >6 to <18 years (yr) with ERA (ILAR criteria) with active disease not responsive to >1 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and >1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. Active disease was defined as >3 active joints (swelling or loss of motion + pain/tenderness) and enthesitis in >1 location. Pts were randomized 2:1 to receive blinded ADA (24 mg/m2 BSA up to 40 mg every other week (wk) [eow]) or placebo (PBO) for 12 wks followed by open-label (OL) ADA eow up to 144 wks. The primary endpoint was% change from baseline (BL) in the number of active joints with arthritis (AJC) at wk 12. Secondary variables assessed included enthesitis count (EC), tender and swollen joint counts, and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric (Pedi) 30/50/70 responses. Results are summarized through 52 wks of treatment. Safety was assessed in terms of adverse events (AE). Results: 46 pts were randomized (31 to ADA, 15 to PBO). No pts discontinued during the DB period; however, 7 pts early escaped to OL ADA. Mean age was 12.9 +/- 2.9 yrs. At BL, mean duration of ERA symptoms was 2.6 +/- 2.3 yrs; mean AJC was 7.8 +/- 6.6, and mean EC was 8.1 +/- 8.4. The % change from BL at wk 12 in AJC was greater in the ADA group vs. PBO (-62.6 +/- 59.5 vs -11.6 +/- 100.5 P = 0.039). Most secondary variables showed numerically greater, but not statistically significant improvement at wk 12 in favor of ADA vs. PBO (Table). Treatment response was maintained with continued ADA therapy up to 52 wks (% change from BL at wk 52 in AJC, -88.7 +/- 26.1). During the DB period AE incidence rates were similar [ADA/ PBO (%)]: any AE (67.7/53.3), serious AE (3.2/0, 1 pt in the ADA group [abdominal pain and headache]), and infectious AEs (29.0/20.0).

Treatment with adalimumab (ADA) has been shown to be safe and effective in JIA patients (pts) when dosed every other week (eow) for up to 3 years [1], but the effect of ADA on growth is not known. Objectives: The purpose of this post hoc analysis is to describe growth parameters in pts with JIA treated with ADA in a clinical trial setting. Methods: Pts aged 4-17 with polyarticular course JIA were enrolled in a phase 3, randomized-withdrawal, double-blind (DB), stratified, parallel-group study, which consisted of a 16-wk open-label (OL) lead-in phase, a 32-wk DB phase, and an OL extension (OLE) phase. In the OLE phase, pts were dosed based on body surface area (24 mg/m2, max 40 mg dose), followed by a switch to 20 or 40 mg eow based on a body weight of <30 kg or >30 kg, respectively. To enter the DB phase, pts had to achieve an American College of Rheumatology Pediatric score >30% (ACR Pedi 30) during the OL lead-in. Pts could enter the OLE after 32 wks in the DB phase or at time of first flare (whichever came sooner). For this analysis, pts in the DB phase were grouped by baseline weight into 2 groups: <33rd percentile and >33rd percentile based on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. All pts who received >1 dose of ADA +/- methotrexate (MTX) were included in the analysis. Mean CDC percentile changes in height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) percentiles were calculated through 104 weeks. Growth and efficacy data were analyzed using last observation carried forward (LOCF). Results: Among the 171 pts enrolled in this study, 144 (84%) met ACR Pedi 30 response criteria at week 16, and 133 (78%) entered the DB phase. Of the 133 pts, 77% were female, with a mean age of 11.2 years, and a mean disease duration of 3.8 years; at baseline, 55 pts (41%) were in the <33rd percentile for weight and 78 pts (59%) were >33rd percentile. There were no differences between MTX and non-MTX groups in mean changes from baseline in weight, height, or BMI percentiles (P > .26). Pts in the lower 33rd percentile climbed to a higher mean growth rate through 104 weeks of ADA treatment. For those who started in the >33rd percentile, growth rates showed an initial increase that remained in the normal range throughout the study. Similar patterns were observed for height and BMI percentiles in these 2 groups. ACR Pedi 30/50/70/90 response rates improved over time in both groups, reaching 85%/76%/60%/36% for the <33rd percentile group and 83%/76%/51%/29% for the >33rd percentile group by the end of the DB phase with ADA treatment. Conclusion: Long-term ADA treatment +/- MTX is associated with improvement and maintenance of growth in children with JIA who had experienced impaired development. ADA treatment improved JIA signs and symptoms in both groups, regardless of baseline growth status."

The aim of this current work was two fold: first, to develop pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models that describe the exposure-response relationships for these efficacy endpoints; and second, to apply this knowledge to aid in sensitive endpoint selection in RA. Methods: The analysis used clinical data sets extracted from 11 phase II-III clinical trials describing 4,600 patients for 5 approved RA drugs. All these trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies in RA patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) as background therapy. For each drug, the modeling was conduced with the pooled dataset combining different studies using sequential PK/PD approach in NONMEM VII. The contribution of drug effect was modeled with a mechanism-based indirect-response model with an Emax (maximal drug effect) inhibitory function on the formation rate (kin). For ACR response, the longitudinal placebo/MTX response was modeled empirically with an exponential decay process. The probabilities of ACR response were then modeled with logistic regression combining the indirect-response model with placebo/MTX effect. For DAS28 score, the underlining placebo/MTX effect was incorporated into the Emax function in an indirect-response model. The final models were used to predict the clinical outcome at various time points following different treatment regimens. Relative sensitivity of these endpoints was assessed using power analysis based on results of trial simulation. Results: The developed longitudinal exposure-response models adequately describe the relationship between drug concentrations and the observed ACR20, 50, 70 response rates and DAS28 scores based on various diagnostic plots. None of the covariate factors evaluated (e.g., demographics, baseline disease characteristics) significantly contributed to the between-subject variability in the pharmacodynamic parameters. The trial simulation and subsquential power analysis showed that the ACR20 response generally demonstrated the highest power in detecting significant effect of active treatment versus placebo at evaluated dosing regimens. Conclusions: The developed exposure-response models can serve as a basis to support future clinical trials design in rheumatoid arthritis disease area."

Here, we present the effects of CAN therapy on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from the phase 3 studies. Methods: In Trial 1, 84 pts were randomized to CAN (43) and PBO (41) and followed for 1 month. In Trial 2, 177 pts (including 71 from Trial 1) received open label CAN in Part 1, of which 100 CAN-responders entered part 2 and were randomized 1:1 to placebo or continued CAN. PROs considered were functional ability by the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire [CHAQ¬©], pain as measured on a visual analog scale [VAS] of 0-100 mm, and HRQoL by the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form (CHQ-PF50 for pts age 5-18 yrs) with rating on physical (PhS) and psychosocial (PsS) health status. Betweentreatment differences were evaluated using analysis covariance models with repeated measures adjusting for treatment group, time, stratification factors and the treatment group-by-time interaction as explanatory variables. Results: At the end of Trial 1, there was significant improvement (p=0.0002) in functional ability with CAN, resulting in an estimated difference (ED) in CHAQ score of -0.69 between the CAN and PBO group at Day 29 from baseline [BL]; this ED constitutes about 3.6x the minimal clinically important difference (-0.19)2 in the CHAQ score. Pain intensity significantly declined (both p <0.0001) in the CAN group vs. PBO both at Day 15 (ED, -46.42) and Day 29 (ED, -41.86).

Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, 12-week, phase 2 study in subjects with active RA despite stable methotrexate treatment. Subjects were randomized (2:2:1) to receive secukinumab i.v. loading (10 mg/kg week 0, 2 and 4, followed by 150 mg s.c. week 8), secukinumab s.c. loading (150 mg week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8) or placebo. The primary objective was to demonstrate the superior efficacy of pooled secukinumab compared to placebo using ACR20 criteria at week 12. Secondary efficacy objectives included ACR20/50/70, ACR components and DAS28 for pooled and individual secukinumab treatment arms. Results: A total of 221 subjects were randomized: 88 to i.v. loading, 89 to s.c. loading and 44 to placebo. All subjects were included in efficacy and safety analyses. Subjects were mainly from Eastern Europe (78%) and had a median of 12 swollen and 20 tender joints at baseline. All were positive for either anti-CCP or RF, with a CRP > 10 mg/L or ESR > 28 mm/1st hr. ACR20 response rate at week 12 was numerically but not statistically significantly greater with pooled secukinumab (49.2%) compared to placebo (40.9%). Reductions of DAS28-CRP were significantly greater for both secukinumab arms compared to placebo at all visits (except i.v. loading week 8) (Figure). No statistically significant differences in ACR20, DAS28-CRP or other efficacy outcomes were observed between the i.v. and s.c. loading regimens. The safety profile was similar to that in previous secukinumab RA trials. The proportion of pooled secukinumab-treated subjects vs. placebotreated subjects was 41.2% vs. 38.6% for any AE, 2.8% vs. 2.3% for serious AEs, and 1.7% vs. 0% for AEs leading to discontinuation. Conclusion: Secukinumab demonstrated improved efficacy in reducing disease activity over placebo as measured by DAS28-CRP, but not ACR20 at week 12 (primary endpoint). Reductions in disease activity were very similar for the i.v. and s.c. secukinumab loading regimens. The AE profile of secukinumab was comparable to placebo.

Methods: Plasma concentrations were modeled for patients treated with CAN (n=50) or PBO after CAN treatment (n=50) and used to predict flare risk by a validated and qualified simulation of the CAN exposure-flare hazard relationship. The model considered both PBO and CAN treatments and multiple covariates, including baseline steroid dose, heterogeneity of the population with respect to disease severity (which had a varying influence on risk of an early flare), and declining CAN concentrations over time due to washout in patients on PBO (after receiving CAN). The final simulation model was also used to explore the dose-response relationship between SJIA flare hazard and CAN dose in a simulated trial (1000 simulations), that modeled 700 patients randomized to 1 of 7 treatment arms: PBO, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 6 mg/kg (all every 4 weeks) of CAN. Results: The final simulation model successfully re-produced the Kaplan- Meier curves observed in the phase III program, with significant differences in flare hazard (p<0.001) between treatment arms. Higher CAN plasma concentrations were associated with lower flare hazard. Differences in the corticosteroid dose at baseline, age, gender, body weight, daily steroid usage, and level of adapted ACR response to CAN were not significant predictors of flare risk. Based on simulation, the probability of flare (90% CI) over 12 months was 63% (55%, 71%) for the PBO arm. CAN at 4mg/kg/every 4 weeks reduced the flare rate over PBO by 39% (28%, 49%), consistent with the clinical data observed. Based on simulation, CAN at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks was associated with annual flare rates of 37% (28%, 47%), 30% (24%, 38%), 26% (21%, 33%), 24% (19%, 30%), 22% (17%, 27%), and 21% (16%, 26%), respectively. Relative to the approved CAN dose, the model predicted a change in flare probability of +13%, +6%, +2%, -2%, and -3% for the 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks doses, respectively. Conclusion: The simulations support 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks as the appropriate dose for preventing SJIA flare events. Doses greater than 4 mg/kg provide only marginal gain in flare reduction over 12 months, while doses less than 4 mg/kg relatively increase the risk of experiencing a flare."

The primary endpoints were area under the serum concentration-time curve from time '0' to time of last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-last) and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) (after second infusion) of the CT-P10 and RTX groups. ACR response, EULAR response, B-cell kinetics, immunogenicity and safety parameters were also evaluated up to week 24. Results: The geometric means were 7870.84 day-mug/mL and 8010.39 day-mug/mL for AUC0-last and 465.94 mug/mL and 477.52 mug/mL for Cmax in the CT-P10 and RTX groups, respectively. The ratios (%) of the geometric means of AUC0-last and Cmax between the CT-P10 and RTX groups were 98.3% (90% CI: 89.6, 107.8) and 97.6% (90% CI: 92.0, 103.5), respectively. The geometric mean area under the curve (AUC) of B-cell count, a comparative PD parameter, was 20.8 cells/muL for the CT-P10 group and 20.4 cells/muL for the RTX group. The ratio (%) of the geometric means of AUC for B-cell count was 102% (90% CI: 98, 106). ACR20/50/70 response rates at week 24 were 63.0%/37.0%/16.0% in the CT-P10 group and 66.7%/31.3%/14.6% in the RTX group. The proportions of patients who had a moderate or good response at week 24 were 76.8% and 79.1% for EULAR (ESR) response and 82.1% and 83.7% for EULAR (CRP) response in the CT-P10 and RTX groups, respectively. The proportions of patients with a positive anti-drug antibody at week 24 were 17.6% (18/102) for the CT-P10 group and 17.6% (9/51) for the RTX group. A total of 166 and 88 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for the CT-P10 and RTX groups, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 16.7% of CT-P10 and 17.6% of RTX patients. Infections were reported in 23.5% of CT-P10 and 25.5% of RTX patients. Infusion reactions were reported in 16.7% of CT-P10 and 19.6% of RTX patients. Conclusion: CT-P10 and RTX were equivalent in terms of AUC0-last and Cmax in patients with active RA. Clinical efficacy for ACR20/50/70 and EULAR response rates and PD for B-cell kinetics were comparable between the two treatment groups. CT-P10 was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to that of RTX up to week 24."

Inhibition of VLA-1 by antibody blockade or genetic ablation is associated with decreased disease severity in animal models of acute and chronic inflammation, including models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This Phase 1, escalating single-dose study evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of SAN-300, an anti-VLA-1 antibody, in healthy subjects and patients with active RA. Methods: In a randomized, placebo-controlled design, 66 healthy subjects received single IV or SC SAN-300 administrations (0.03-2.0 mg/kg IV; 2.0-6.0 mg/kg SC; N=45) or placebo (N=21). Two patients with active RA received SAN-300 2.0 mg/kg IV (N=1) or placebo (N=1). Serum SAN-300 concentrations, VLA-1 receptor occupancy (RO), and safety were assessed through Day 29. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria and Disease Activity Score 28 based on CRP (DAS28-CRP) were assessed in patients with active RA. Results: Serum SAN-300 concentrations were undetectable in most subjects at low doses (0.03-0.3 mg/kg IV). In subjects receiving SAN-300 0.6-2.0 mg/kg IV or 2.0-6.0 mg/kg SC, a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile was observed. Essentially complete VLA-1 RO (> 90%) was noted at doses above 0.8 mg/kg IV and 2.0 mg/kg SC, with durable RO (> 50%) observed through Day 8 for SAN-300 2.0 mg/kg SC and Day 15 for SAN-300 4.0-6.0 mg/kg SC. SAN-300 was generally well tolerated. No severe/serious infections were reported. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in intensity. The most common AEs upon IV administration were mild or moderate headaches and infusion reactions. Infusion reactions occurred with 0.8-2.0 mg/kg IV; all events improved by 72 h. Among subjects receiving SAN-300 SC, headaches and mild injection-site reactions were most common. Transient, mild to moderate decreases in absolute neutrophil counts (1.1-1.9 x 109/L; normal: 1.9-8.0 x 109/L) were observed, mostly at higher doses. All cases resolved without sequelae. The single patient with active RA who received SAN-300 2.0 mg/kg IV met ACR50 at Days 15 and 29 and achieved a good response per EULAR criteria based on DAS28-CRP at Day 15 (< 1.66; absolute score 2.31), and a moderate response at Day 29 (< 0.92; 3.05). The placebo patient did not meet criteria for ACR20 or DAS28-CRP response at any time point. Conclusion: In this first-in-human study, SAN-300, an antibody against novel therapeutic target VLA-1, showed nonlinear pharmacokinetics. However, durable saturation of VLA-1 was observed following IV or SC administration. SAN-300 was generally well tolerated, with the SC formulation mitigating the occurrence of mild or moderate infusion reactions seen at higher IV doses. Given favorable tolerability, encouraging RO, and ease of administration, the SC route of administration warrants investigation in future multiple-dose studies in patients with active RA."

This paper reports the study design and baseline characteristics of the study population. 35,000 women aged 65-80 years were selected at random from the population in the Region of Southern Denmark and-before inclusion-randomized to either a screening group or a control group. As first step, a self-administered questionnaire regarding risk factors for osteoporosis based on FRAX(¬Æ) was issued to both groups. As second step, subjects in the screening group with a 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures ‚â•15% were offered a DXA scan. Patients diagnosed with osteoporosis from the DXA scan were advised to see their GP and discuss pharmaceutical treatment according to Danish National guidelines. The primary outcome is incident clinical fractures as evaluated through annual follow-up using the Danish National Patient Registry. The secondary outcomes are cost-effectiveness, participation rate, and patient preferences. 20,904 (60%) women participated and included in the baseline analyses (10,411 in screening and 10,949 in control group). The mean age was 71 years. As expected by randomization, the screening and control groups had similar baseline characteristics. Screening for osteoporosis is at present not evidence based according to the WHO screening criteria. The ROSE study is expected to provide knowledge of the effectiveness of a screening strategy that may be implemented in health care systems to prevent fractures."

While less selective JAK inhibitors have shown long-term efficacy in treating inflammatory conditions, this was accompanied by dose-limiting side effects. Here, we describe the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib and its active metabolite in healthy volunteers and the use of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation to support dose selection for phase IIB in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: two trials were conducted in healthy male volunteers. In the first trial, filgotinib was administered AS single doses from 10 mg up to multiple daily doses of 200 mg. In the second trial, daily doses of 300 and 450 mg for 10 days were evaluated. Non-compartmental analysis was used to determine individual pharmacokinetic parameters for filgotinib and its metabolite. The overall pharmacodynamic activity for the two moieties was assessed in whole blood using interleukin-6-induced phosphorylation of signal-transducer and activator of transcription 1 AS a biomarker for JAK1 activity. These data were used to conduct non-linear mixed-effects modeling to investigate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship. Results: modeling and simulation on the basis of early clinical data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib are dose proportional up to 200 mg, in agreement with observed data, and support that both filgotinib and its metabolite contribute to its pharmacodynamic effects. Simulation of biomarker response supports that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect is reached at a daily dose of 200 mg filgotinib. Conclusion: based on these results, a daily dose range up to 200 mg has been selected for phase IIB dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis"
9261601,,10.5152/eurjrheumatol.2014.020,"Objective. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psychological trauma or severe stress are well correlated. Depression and anxiety with psychoneuroimmunological factors have the significant impact in RA. Our main goal was to evaluate the correlation of mental health status and RA activity estimated by the laboratory and clinical parameters. Material and Methods. The open clinical prospective study that lasted for 6 months was performed. Total 72 patients were included, among them 58 women and 14 men, aged 34 to 80 years, were checked for current mental health. RA patients were randomized according to the Brief Inventory Scale (BSI) with 53 questions included ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe). This testing was done once during a study. Based on the results, RA patients were selected into mentally stable and mentally unstable ones. The following laboratory and clinical parameters were analyzed: sex, age, Erythrocyte Sedimentation rate (ESR), Rheumatoid factor (RF), C-reactive protein (CRP), Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, Disease activity score (DAS28). No extra-articular involvement was seen in any RA patients. The hi-square test, ANOVA, Pearson's coefficient and IBM Statistics - SPSS v19 were used. Results. Our results have shown that from total 72 RA patients, 44 RA patients were mentally stable and 28 mentally unstable. All patients had active disease either moderate or severe. The only significant correlation of depression and anxiety with activity of RA was found in CRP and DAS28, but no significance was detected in ESR, RF and anti-CCP. The DAS28 showed a high disease activity with average of 5.3 and CRP of 20.9 mg/L in patients with unstable mental health compared to stable mental health patients where RA was associated with moderate DAS average valued of 4,35 and CRP of 14,1 mg/L. Depression and anxiety was found in all 28 (39%) of RA patients. Conclusion. Mentally unstable RA patients correlate more with severe disease activity, while mentally stable express moderate disease activity. (Table Presented)."

Relevance: The medical management of RA has advanced with the introduction of biologic drugs, including TNFalpha inhibitors. Anti-TNFalpha therapy may help prevent rheumatoid cachexia. Dynamic exercise is an important nonpharmacological therapy in RA however its effect on function for people with RA taking anti-TNFalpha medication is not described. This study aims to examine this. Participants: A convenience sample of 51 people with RA (ACR functional class I, II and III) taking anti-TNFalpha therapy medication was recruited from a rheumatology service based in two hospitals in Dublin, Ireland. 12 were male and 39 were female, with a mean age of 56 (+/-10) years. The mean length of diagnosis was 14.1 (+/-10.5) years and the mean length of time taking anti-TNFalpha medication was 2.9 (+/-2.1) years. Methods: Following informed consent, participants were randomised into one of 3 groups: a gym (land-based), a hydrotherapy (water-based) or a control group. The gym and hydrotherapy interventions consisted of flexibility, strengthening and aerobic exercises. Exercise classes were undertaken for 1 hour, twice weekly for 8 weeks. Participants were advised to continue the exercise programmes unsupervised from week 8 to week 24. The control group received no intervention. Participants were assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline, 8 and 24 weeks. Outcome measures included the HAQ, the 50 ft walk test (50ftWT) and the timed chair stand test (TCST). Semi-structured interviews were conducted at 24 weeks with a random sample of exercise group participants to ascertain exercise continuation levels of individuals during follow-up. Analysis: Within and between group changes were examined using parametric and non-parametric analyses, on an intention-to-treat basis. Changes in outcome from 0 to 8 weeks and 0 to 24 weeks in the 'land-based exercise group versus control group' and the 'water-based exercise group versus control group' were examined. The semi-structured interviews were transcribed and examined for emergent themes using a grounded theory approach. Results: At 8 weeks when compared to the control group, the 50ftWT improved significantly in the gym (p = 0.02) and hydrotherapy (p = 0.01) groups and the TCST improved significantly in the gym group (p = 0.02). No significant change occurred in HAQ scores. Improvements were not maintained at 24 weeks. Of the 17 individuals interviewed at 24 weeks, 3 had continued to exercise. Non-exercisers identified 'lack of access to facilities' and 'reduced motivation' as reasons for non-continuation. Conclusions: An 8-week dynamic exercise programme improved function in this sample of people with RA taking anti-TNFalpha medication. This was reflected in changes in lower-limb function tests, but not the HAQ. Further studies comparing the effect of dynamic exercise in people with RA taking anti-TNFalpha medication to those not taking the medication are necessary. Implications: Access to facilities and support through supervised exercise classes may enable this population to continue to engage in long-term exercise."

The aim of this pilot randomized placebo-controlled study was to estimate the effects of laser acupuncture on salivary flow rates in patients with severe hyposalivation due to SS. A prospective cohort of 26 female patients affected by SS has been evaluated. The laser therapy equipment used was the Pointer Pulse, emitting light in the red visible spectrum (650 nm), with a power of 5 mW and an irradiation time of 120 s per acupoint, in an area of 3.14 mm2 (fluence = 19.2 J/cm2, power density = 0.16 W/cm2, total dose = 0.6 J). The following acupuncture points were stimulated bilaterally: LI 2 Erjian, ST 5 Daying, ST 6 Jiache, ST 7 Xiaguan, SI 19 Tinggong, and BL 13 Feishu. True laser acupuncture led to a significantly higher amount of saliva production, measured after the end of the protocol (5 weeks), and during the 6-month follow-up period. The results are stable from the end of the protocol until the 3rd month of follow-up; during the last control, a slight but significant decrease in production has also been shown. This preliminary study proposes laser acupuncture as a possible treatment for improving salivary flow rates in patients with SS, but further validation on a larger sample is still necessary."

9261625,,10.3892/etm.2015.2747,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation affecting target tissues including the joints, bones, and synovial membrane. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of RA remains to be determined, and investigations into the treatment of RA are imperative. Vitamin D (Vit D) was previously found to be associated with the activity of RA and exerts therapeutic benefits. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Vit D on the recurrence rate of RA. A total of 377 patients with RA at remission stage were divided into the normal Vit D group and the Vit D-deficient group according to their Vit D levels at baseline. The patients in the Vit D-deficient group were further randomly allocated to receive treatment with or without Vit D. The patients were followed up for 24 months, and the visual analogue scale, as well as the number of pain and swelling joints were recorded every 2-3 months. In addition, C-reactive protein and the blood sedimentation rate were measured every 2-3 months to assess the recurrence of RA based on disease activity score 28 (DAS28). The recurrence rate of RA was 16.7, 19.0 and 29.5% for the normal Vit D group (n=168), Vit D treatment subgroup (n=84), and non-Vit D treatment subgroup (n=88), respectively. The recurrence rate of the normal Vit D group was lower, compared to the non-Vit D treatment subgroup, and the difference was statistically significant. However, the difference was not statistically significant between the Vit D treatment subgroup and non-Vit D treatment subgroup. In conclusion, a decreased level of Vit D is a risk factor for the recurrence of RA."

In a randomised controlled trial, a control group-which received a group-based patient education session led by a physical therapist-was compared to a treatment group which received the education session plus a motivational interview from a physical therapist and two self-regulation coaching sessions from a rheumatology nurse. Outcomes included leisure-time PA, days per week with at least 30 min of moderate-intensity PA, self-efficacy and autonomous motivation (cognitions which predict PA initiation and maintenance), disease activity, functional status, depressive symptoms and fatigue. Effects were assessed using mixed models repeated measures. Of the 78 patients randomised, 76 and 67 completed the post-treatment and follow-up assessments, respectively. Significant treatment effects were found for leisure-time PA (p=0.022), active days/week (p=0.016), self-efficacy (p=0.008) and autonomous motivation (p=0.001). At post-treatment and 6-months follow-up, significantly more treated patients than controls met current PA recommendations. No significant effects were found for disease activity, functional status, depressive symptoms or fatigue. Combining motivation- and action-focused intervention approaches improved PA-related cognitions and led to improved uptake and maintenance of leisure-time PA. However, further research is necessary to identify ways of helping patients with RA transition to-and maintain-more intensive forms of PA which are more likely to improve disease activity and functional status"

This study examines the relationships between plasma phospholipid levels of the n-3 fatty acids in fish oil, EPA and DHA, and remission and DMARD use in recent-onset RA. EPA and DHA were measured in blood samples from both groups of the RCT. The data were analysed AS a single cohort, and cox proportional hazards models were used to examine relationships between plasma phospholipid (PL) EPA and DHA and various outcome measures. When analysed AS a single cohort, plasma PL EPA was related to time to remission, with a one unit increase in EPA (1 % total fatty acids) associated with a 12 % increase in the probability of remission at any time during the study period (hazard ratio (HR)=112; 95 % CI 102, 123; P=002). Adjustment for smoking, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and 'shared epitope' HLA-DR allele status did not change the HR. Plasma PL EPA, adjusted for the same variables, was negatively related to time to DMARD failure (HR=085; 95 % CI 072, 099; P=0047). The HR for DHA and time to remission or DMARD failure were similar in magnitude to those for EPA, but not statistically significant.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the interleukin 17 receptor, in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. Patients (n = 252) with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of brodalumab (70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the American College of Rheumatology 50% response (ACR50) at Week 12. Results. Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced among treatment groups. At Week 12, ACR50 occurred in 16% (70 mg), 16% (140 mg), 10% (210 mg), and 13% (placebo; all nonsignificant vs placebo) of subjects. No significant treatment effects were observed for the secondary endpoints, including ACR20, ACR70, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints. Incidences of all adverse events (AE), including serious AE (SAE), were similar across treatment groups. A total of 7 subjects reported SAE during the study (2 in the placebo group and 5 in the brodalumab groups), none of which was treatment related. There was 1 death (cardiopulmonary failure) ~1 week after the last dose in the 140 mg group. Conclusion. Our study failed to find evidence of meaningful clinical efficacy with brodalumab treatment in subjects with RA who had an inadequate response to MTX. These preliminary results do not support further evaluation of brodalumab as a treatment for RA."
9261631,,10.3899/jrheum.141129,"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the effect of Integral-based hatha yoga in sedentary people with arthritis.
METHODS: there were 75 sedentary adults aged 18+ years with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or knee osteoarthritis randomly assigned to 8 weeks of yoga (two 60-min classes and 1 home practice/wk) or waitlist. Poses were modified for individual needs. The primary endpoint was physical health  adjusted for baseline; exploratory adjusted outcomes included fitness, mood, stress, self-efficacy, SF-36 health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and RA disease activity. In everyone completing yoga, we explored longterm effects at 9 months.
RESULTS: participants were mostly female (96%), white (55%), and college-educated (51%), with a mean (SD) age of 52 years (12 yrs). Average disease duration was 9 years and 49% had RA. At 8 weeks, yoga was associated with significantly higher PCS (6.5, 95% CI 2.0-10.7), walking capacity (125 m, 95% CI 15-235), positive affect (5.2, 95% CI 1.4-8.9), and lower Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (-3.0, 95% CI -4.8 - -1.3). Significant improvements (p < 0.05) were evident in SF-36 role physical, pain, general health, vitality, and mental health scales. Balance, grip strength, and flexibility were similar between groups. Twenty-two out of 28 in the waitlist group completed yoga. Among all yoga participants, significant (p < 0.05) improvements were observed in mean PCS, flexibility, 6-min walk, and all psychological and most HRQOL domains at 8 weeks with most still evident 9 months later. Of 7 adverse events, none were associated with yoga.
CONCLUSION: preliminary evidence suggests yoga may help sedentary individuals with arthritis safely increase physical activity, and improve physical and psychological health and HRQOL. Clinical Trials NCT00349869."

However, this is based on studies conducted with lower MTX dosage than used currently. It is unclear whether higher doses of folic acid may be better in reducing toxicity with currently used dosage of MTX. Methods: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial of 24 weeks duration. To be eligible, patients should have rheumatoid arthritis (1987 ACR criteria), be 18-75 years of age, not be on MTX and have active disease (DAS28 (3)>3.2). MTX was started at 10 mg/week and escalated to 25 mg/week by 12 weeks. Folic acid was given at a dose of 10 mg (FA-10) or 30 mg per week (FA-30). Co-primary endpoints were incidence of toxicity (undesirable symptoms and laboratory abnormalities) and change in disease activity by 24 weeks. Intention-totreat and per-protocol analyses were performed. Results: Among 100 patients enrolled, 51 and 49 were randomized to FA10 and FA30 respectively (Figure 1). By 24 weeks, there were 6 patient withdrawals in either group and mean (+/-SD) dose of MTX was 22.8 +/- 4.4 and 21.4 +/- 4.6 mg per week (P = 0.1). Frequency of patients with undesirable symptoms was non-significantly lower by 7.4% (CI -27.4, 12.7) in FA10 compared to FA30. There was also no difference in frequency of transaminitis (42.6, 45.7%, P = 0.7) or cytopenias (4.3, 4.3%, P = 0.9). At 24 weeks, DAS28 (3) declined in both groups by a similar extent (-1.1 +/- 1.0, -1.3 +/- 1.0, P = 0.2) and EULAR good or moderate response occurred in 56.9 and 67.4% (P = 0.3) (Figure 2). Conclusions: Even with the high doses of MTX used in current practice, there was no additional benefit (or harm) of a higher dose of folic acid like 30 mg per week over a usual dose of 10 mg per week.

Consecutive rheumatology patients seen for methotrexate self-injection education were enrolled. Prior to education, patient selfconfidence for self-injection, age, gender and education were recorded. Patients were randomized 1: 1 to standard teaching or the intervention: a 12-min methotrexate selfinjection education video followed by further in-person nurse education. Patients recorded their post-education confidence for self-injection, satisfaction with the teaching process and answered four specific questions testing knowledge on methotrexate self-injection. The time spent providing direct education to the patient was recorded. Twenty-nine patients participated in this study: 15 had standard (C) teaching and 14 were in the intervention group (I). Average age, gender and education level were similar in both groups. Both groups were satisfied with the quality of teaching. There was no difference in pre-confidence (C = 5.5/10 vs. I = 4.7/10, p = 0.44) or post-confidence (C = 8.8, I = 8.8, p = 0.93) between the groups. There was a trend toward improved patient knowledge in the video group versus the standard group (C = 4.7/6, I = 5.5/6, p = 0.15). Nurse teaching time was less in the video group (C = 60 min, I = 44 min, p = 0.012), with men requiring longer education time than women across all groups. An education video may be a good supplement to standard in-person nurse teaching for methotrexate self-injection. It equals the standard teaching practise with regard to patient satisfaction, confidence and knowledge while decreasing teaching time by 25 %"
9261641,,10.3899/jrheum.131282,"OBJECTIVE: Sleep disturbance and chronic fatigue are common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and contribute to disability, symptomatology, and healthcare use. It has long been recognized in other populations that exercise can improve sleep and diminish fatigue. The effect of exercise on sleep quality and fatigue in RA has not been evaluated.
METHODS: Ours is a randomized controlled study in RA to determine the effect of an exercise program on sleep quality and fatigue. These were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Fatigue Severity Scale. Patients were randomized to either a 12-week, home-based exercise intervention or usual care. The exercise program consisted of specific exercises to target individual deficiencies identified using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) with cardiovascular work as per the guidelines. The intervention group was evaluated on a 3-week basis. Full evaluation was carried out at baseline and at 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Forty patients were randomized to the intervention with 38 controls. In the exercise intervention group, there was a statistically significant improvement in HAQ (p = 0.00), pain (p = 0.05), stiffness (p = 0.05), sleep quality (p = 0.04), and fatigue (p = 0.04). In our control group, there was a statistically significant improvement demonstrated in their overall perceptions of the benefits of exercise, but none of the other variables.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that an exercise program resulted in significant improvement in sleep quality and fatigue. This is particularly interesting given the importance of fatigue as an outcome measure in RA and gives us yet another reason to prescribe exercise in this population."

In aggressive disease, joint damage can occur within 6¬†months from symptom onset. Early, intensive treatment with conventional and biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) can delay the onset and progression of joint damage. The primary objective of the study is to investigate the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or radiography (x-ray) over standard of care AS tools to guide DMARD treatment decision-making by rheumatologists for the care of RA. METHODS: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial has been designed. Rheumatoid and undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis patients will undergo an MRI and x-ray assessment every 6¬†months. Baseline adaptive randomization will BE used to allocate participants to MRI, x-ray, or sham-intervention groups on a background of standard of care. Prognostic markers, treating physician, and baseline DMARD therapy will BE used AS intervention allocation parameters. The outcome measures in rheumatology RA MRI score and the van der heijde-modified sharp score will BE used to evaluate the MRI and x-ray images, respectively. Radiologists will score anonymized images for all patients regardless of intervention allocation. Disease progression will BE determined based on the study-specific, inter-rater smallest detectable difference. Allocation-dependent, intervention-concealed reports of positive or negative disease progression will BE reported to the treating rheumatologist. Negative reports will BE delivered for the sham-intervention group. Study-based radiology clinical reports will BE provided to the treating rheumatologists for extra-study x-ray requisitions to limit patient radiation exposure AS part of diagnostic imaging standard of care. DMARD treatment dose escalation and therapy changes will BE measured to evaluate the primary objective. A sample size of 186 (62 per group) patients will BE required to determine a 36% difference in pharmacological treatment escalation between the three groups with intermediate dispersion of data with 90% power at a 5% level of significance. DISCUSSION: this study will determine if monitoring RA and undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis patients using MRI and x-ray every 6¬†months over 2¬†years provides incremental evidence over standard of care to influence pharmacotherapeutic decision-making and ultimately hinder disease progression.

METHODS: we enrolled in the study 42 patients with seropositive RA and proteinuria, the control group (20 persons) was formed from healthy blood donors, the comparison group (23 persons) was formed from RA patients without proteinuria. Kidney biopsy was performed in 26 patients (glomerulonephritis was diagnosed in 14 patients, –ê–ê-amyloidosis in 7 patients and tubulointerstitial nephritis in 5 patients).
RESULTS: urine nephrin concentration in patients with RA and proteinuria was 6.2 (3.0; 8.8) ng/ml and significantly differed in its levels both in controls - 3.6 (2.4; 5.3) ng/ml (p=0.03) and RA patients without proteinuria - 3.2 (2.1; 5.1) ng/ ml (p=0.015) group. In RA patients with proteinuria, we found a positive correlation between urine nephrin and protein concentrations (r=0.4; p=0.04). Urine nephrin levels in patients of the glomerulonephritis - 7.3 (5.9; 9.2) and amyloidosis groups - 6.9 (3.9; 9.8) ng/ml were higher than in the controls (p=0.001; p=0.04) and in the group of patients without proteinuria (p=0.005; p=0.03). In the patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis urine nephrin concentration did not differ significantly with the values in both the control and the RA patients without proteinuria groups.
CONCLUSIONS: according to our data, proteinuria in the overall cohort of patients with seropositive RA is associated with increased levels of urine nephrin excretion, the highest levels of nephrin excretion were registered in patients with glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis."

METHODS: in this prospective randomized study, 285 patients aged above 65 years with hip fractures (Garden III or IV) were included from January 2001 to December 2005. The cases were randomly allocated to either the CRIF group or THA group. Patients with pathological fractures (bone tumors or metabolic bone disease), preoperative avascular necrosis of the femoral head, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, hemiplegia, long-term bed rest and complications affecting hip functions were excluded.
RESULTS: during the 5-year follow-up, CRIF group had significantly higher rates of complication in hip joint, general complication and reoperation than THA group (38.3% vs. 12.7%, P<0.01; 45.3% vs. 21.7%, P<0.01; 33.6% vs. 10.2%, P<0.05 respectively). There was no difference in mortality between the two groups. Postoperative function of the hip joint in THA group recovered favorably with higher Harris scores.
CONCLUSION: for displaced fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients, THA can achieve a lower rate of complication and reoperation, as well as better postoperative recovery of hip joint function compared with CRIF."

This is a 24-week, randomized, multicenter, single-blind study comparing TCM with WM (as used in China) carried out between June 2002 and December 2004 in nine research centers in China, involving 489 patients. Patients were randomized to receive TCM (n = 247), MTX and SSZ (n = 242). MTX was started at a dose of 5 mg to a final dose of 7.5-15 mg weekly. The maintenance dose was 2.5-7.5 mg weekly. The starting dose of SSZ was 0.25 g bid, increasing by 0.25 g a day once a week to a final dose of 0.5-1 g qid. The maintenance dose was 0.5 g tid to qid. Primary end point was the proportion of patients with response according to the American College of Rheumatology 20 % improvement criteria (ACR20) at weeks 24. At 24 weeks, ACR20 responses were 53.0 % in TCM group and 66.5 % in WM group, (P < 0.001) at 24 weeks. ACR 50 responses were 31.6 % of TCM group and 42.6 % in WM group, (P = 0.01). ACR70 responses were 12.6 % in TCM group and 17.4 % in WM group, (P = 0.14). Side effects were observed more frequently in WM group. In this study, ACR20, ACR50 responses at 24 weeks were significantly better in the WM treated group, by intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol analysis. The ACR 70 response showed no significant difference between the two groups.

The objective of this study was to explore the association between clinical endpoints used to gauge RA treatment efficacy and patient-reported outcomes of health-related quality of life, fatigue, and physical function in RA patients treated with secukinumab in a phase 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT).
METHOD: adult RA patients (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ237) with incomplete responses to methotrexate were randomized equally to receive monthly s.c. injections of secukinumab 25¬†mg, 75¬†mg, 150¬†mg, 300¬†mg or placebo. Clinical endpoints used in this study included the ACR response criteria and its components and simplified disease activity score. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) included Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36  Survey, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue). Patients were categorized into mutually exclusive groups according to the magnitude and direction of change from baseline to week 16 in each clinical endpoint. Definitions of minimal important differences [MID] in each clinical endpoint were used to categorize patients, as well as thresholds beyond MID. Mean changes from baseline to week 16 were computed for each PRO and analyses of variance to test the differences in PRO changes observed across groups of patients that differed in each clinical endpoint. Analyses were limited to patients randomized to secukinumab treatment. All dose groups were combined (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ187).
RESULTS: mean changes from baseline in each PRO differed significantly across groups of patients in the expected direction. With few exceptions, there was considerable agreement between clinical endpoints and PROs concerning the magnitude of change defined as clinically meaningful. More importantly, results demonstrated that greater improvements in clinical endpoints were associated with incrementally better improvements in HRQoL, fatigue, and physical function.
CONCLUSION: results of this study show considerable agreement between minimal thresholds of improvement established for PROs and clinical outcome measures used in RA treatment studies and provide thresholds to be considered in gauging the importance of a treatment effect that goes beyond what is considered as minimally important for PRO measures."

This study investigated the effect of exercise on markers of oxidative stress in RA, following acute exercise and a period of exercise training.
METHODS: acute exercise study: RA patients (N¬†=¬†12, age: 56¬†¬±¬†11) undertook a bout of exercise (30-40¬†min, 70¬†% VO2MAX), and blood samples were taken before and after exercise to assess markers of oxidative stress. Training study: RA patients (N¬†=¬†19, age: 56¬†¬±¬†10) were randomised into either a control or exercise group, who undertook 3 exercise sessions per week (30-40¬†min @70¬†% VO2MAX) for 3¬†months. Plasma markers of oxidative stress (protein carbonyls (PC), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and catalase (CAT) activity), inflammation (interleukin-8 (IL-8) and C-reactive protein (CRP)) and nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) were assessed before and after training.
RESULTS: acute exercise study: protein carbonyls (PC) (+18¬†%) and NOx (+27¬†%) were significantly increased following exercise. Training study: 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) decreased (2.18¬†¬±¬†1.78 to 1.10¬†¬±¬†0.93¬†ŒºM) in the exercise group only, alongside increases in aerobic fitness (24.45¬†¬±¬†4.98 to 27.10¬†¬±¬†4.51¬†ml/kg/min(-1)) and reductions in disease activity score (DAS: 3.47¬†¬±¬†1.17 to 2.88¬†¬±¬†0.76).

Clinical response was assessed using the American College of Rheumatology 20 % improvement criteria ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70, with ACR20 as the primary major endpoints. Disease activity scores in 28 joints with erythrocyte sedimentation rate assessment (DAS28-ESR) were used to evaluate disease activity. After 24 weeks of treatment, significantly more patients in Leining group achieved ACR20 response than those in placebo group (70.61 vs. 46.36 %; p < 0.001). Similarly, ACR50 and ACR70 responses of Leining group were significantly higher than those of placebo group (40.30 vs. 22.73 %; p < 0.001 and 16.67 vs. 7.27 %; p < 0.05, respectively). DAS28-ESR in Leining group was significantly reduced compared to that in placebo group, with greater clinically meaningful (>1.2 unit) improvement (54.85 vs. 29.09 %, p < 0.05). Both the rates of remission (DAS28-ESR < 2.6) and low disease activity (DAS28-ESR < 3.2) were greater in the Leining group than those in the placebo group (12.42 vs. 2.73 %; p < 0.05 and 15.45 vs. 2.73 %; p < 0.05 respectively). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both Leining and placebo groups. No neutralizing antibodies were detected. Leining demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy compared with placebo in Chinese patients with active RA despite MTX therapy.

9261678,,10.3899/jrheum.121468,"OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment recommendations suggest target attainment within the first 3 months of therapy, yet delayed clinical responses can occur. This analysis assessed the longterm clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes associated with delayed responses to methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy or to the combination of adalimumab (ADA) + MTX.
METHODS: In this posthoc analysis, patients with early RA who received MTX monotherapy or ADA + MTX in the PREMIER study were categorized based on clinical responses at 3 and 6 months [American College of Rheumatology response, 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-C-reactive protein (CRP) improvement and targets]. ""Month 3"" responders met the clinical measure at both months 3 and 6, and ""Month 6"" responders met the clinical measure only at Month 6. The odds of achieving longterm outcomes [remission (DAS28-CRP < 2.6), normal function (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index < 0.5), or rapid radiographic progression (Œî modified total Sharp score > 3 U/yr)] were modeled using logistic regression, including treatment, response, and interaction.
RESULTS: A delayed or low-level response was associated with poorer longterm outcomes. Generally, MTX Month 6 responders demonstrated worse clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes than Month 3 MTX and Month 3 or 6 ADA + MTX responders. Although similar longterm benefit was observed for ADA + MTX responders, delayed (Month 6) responders exhibited downward trends in clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes that were comparable with those experienced by Month 3 MTX responders.
CONCLUSION: Response speed and magnitude predict longterm outcomes in patients with early RA treated with MTX or ADA + MTX. MTX-treated patients failing to demonstrate a Month 3 clinical response have less-favorable outcomes than other groups, while outcomes in ADA + MTX Month 3 and Month 6 responders tended to be comparable."

Children with JIA are at risk of inflammation of the uvea in the eye (uveitis). Overall, 20% to 25% of paediatric uveitis is associated with JIA. Major risk factors for development of uveitis in JIA are oligoarticular pattern of arthritis, an age at onset of arthritis of less than seven years of age, and antinuclear antibody positivity. In the initial stages of mild to moderate inflammation the uveitis is asymptomatic. This has led to current practice of screening all children with JIA for uveitis. Approximately 12% to 38% of patients with JIA develop uveitis in seven years following onset of arthritis. In 30% to 50% of children with JIA-associated uveitis structural complications are present at diagnosis. Furthermore about 50% to 75% of those with severe uveitis will eventually develop visual impairment secondary to ocular complications such as cataract and glaucoma. Defining the severity of inflammation and structural complications in uveitis patients is now possible following Standardised Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) guidelines, and modified to incorporate the consensus of end point and outcome criteria into the design of randomised trials. Despite current screening and therapeutic options (pre-biologics) 10% to 15% of children with JIA-associated uveitis may develop bilateral visual impairment and certified legally blind. To date, there remains no controlled trial evidence of benefits of biologic therapy.
METHODS/DESIGN: this study will randomise 154 patients aged 2 to 18 years with active JIA-associated uveitis (despite methotrexate (MTX) treatment for at least 12 weeks). All participants will be treated for 18 months, with follow up of 3 years from randomisation (continuing on MTX throughout). All participants will receive a stable dose of MTX and in addition either adalimumab (20 mg/0.8 ml for patients<30 kg or 40 mg/0.8 ml for patients weighing 30 kg or more, subcutaneous (s/c) injection every 2 weeks based on body weight), or placebo (0.8 ml as appropriate according to body weight) s/c injection every 2 weeks.
DISCUSSION: this is the first randomised controlled trial that will assess the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: a cohort of 128 consecutively operated patients (OA: n‚Äâ=‚Äâ92, RA: n‚Äâ=‚Äâ36) treated with bicondylar TKA was included in this prospective, clinical study. Knee function was assessed preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months after TKA, using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Oxford Knee Score (OKS).
RESULTS: both OKS and KOOS revealed a statistically significant improvement for OA and RA patients at 6 and 12 months after surgery, as compared to the preoperative status. The results of the OKS at 6 and 12 months did not show a further improvement for either group. The KOOS, however, revealed an additional improvement between 6 and 12 months for the osteoarthritis group, regarding the total score and all subscores, but not for the RA subgroup.
CONCLUSION: functional recovery after TKA improves in the second 6 months after surgery in OA patients, but not in RA patients, when knee function is exclusively assessed with patient-reported outcome measures."
9261690,,10.1371/journal.pone.0071529,"BACKGROUND: folklore remedies for pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis include the application of magnets and copper to the skin. Despite the popular use of devices containing magnets or copper for this purpose, little research has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of such treatments.
OBJECTIVE: to investigate whether the practice of wearing magnetic wrists straps, or copper bracelets, offers any specific therapeutic benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
DESIGN: randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial.
METHODS: 70 patients, aged 33 to 79 years and predominantly female (n = 52), with painful rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from general practices within Yorkshire. Participants were randomly allocated to wear four devices in a different order. Devices tested were: a standard (1502 to 2365 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised (<20 gauss) wrist strap, an attenuated (250 to 350 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Devices were each worn for five weeks, with treatment phases being separated by one week wash-out periods. The primary outcome measured was pain using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Secondary pain measures were the McGill Pain Questionnaire and tender joint count. Inflammation was assessed using C-reactive protein and plasma viscosity blood tests and by swollen joint count. Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Disability Index). Disease activity and medication use was also measured.
RESULTS: 65 participants provided complete self-report outcome data for all devices, four participants provided partial data. Analysis of treatment outcomes did not reveal any statistically significant differences (P>0.05) between the four devices in terms of their effects on pain, inflammation, physical function, disease activity, or medication use.
CONCLUSIONS: wearing a magnetic wrist strap or a copper bracelet did not appear to have any meaningful therapeutic effect, beyond that of a placebo, for alleviating symptoms and combating disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

METHODS: a prospective, randomized controlled study was carried out. RA patients of shen deficiency and cold invading syndrome in the treatment group (120 cases) were treated with BQZD and MTX (10 mg/week), while those in the control group (120 cases) were treated with MTX (10 mg/week) alone. The therapeutic course for all was 24 weeks. The efficacy and safety indices were evaluated at the baseline and 24 weeks after treatment, including clinical signs and symptoms, condition assessment, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), disease activity index 28 (DAS28), laboratory parameters of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP), safety indicators, and chinese medical syndrome integrals. RESULTS: the total effective rate was 80. 0% in the treatment group, better than that of the control group (66.7%), showing statistical difference (P <0.01). In the two groups significant improvement of clinical signs and symptoms, ESR, CRP, visual analogue scale (VAS) by both physicians and patients, HAQ, DAS28, and chinese medical syndrome integrals after treatment were shown (P <0.01).

9261706,,10.3899/jrheum.121346,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity and functional disability over time, considering indirect (predictive) and direct (concurrent) associations as well as the influence of radiographic joint damage and treatment strategy.
METHODS: Functional disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], disease activity [28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)], and radiographic joint damage [Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS)] were measured in 4 consecutive randomized controlled trials with increasingly intensive (tight control) treatment strategies. Average followup time for the 3 cohorts was 97, 53, and 50 months, respectively. Next to current DAS28, the previous DAS28 was used to study the predictive effect of a change in DAS28 on progression of functional disability (HAQ). Finally, it was investigated whether SHS mediated the predictive effect of DAS28.
RESULTS: In patients treated with intensive treatment strategies, the progression of HAQ over time was statistically significantly less (p < 0.0001). The predictive influence of DAS28 on HAQ progression increased over the duration of the disease. SHS was not found to influence HAQ progression and did not mediate the predictive effect of DAS28. In the less intensively treated patients, the direct effect of disease activity decreased with disease duration, and contrarily, SHS did influence HAQ progression, but was not found to (fully) mediate the predictive effect of DAS28.
CONCLUSION: In patients with RA treated with modern treatment strategies, there is less functional decline over time. Further, disease activity does predict functional decline but joint damage does not. This might indicate that factors associated with cumulative disease activity but not visible on radiographs can influence functional decline in patients with RA. This further underlines the importance of disease activity as a treatment target in early RA and in established RA."

RESULTS: Forty-five patients were analyzed, 87% were women (mean age 52 yrs, mean disease duration 14 yrs). During the 12 months of followup, 44% of patients maintained remission. Relapses occurred in 56% of patients: 14 during the first 3 months after the last TCZ administration. Retreatment using other agents achieved low disease activity or remission.

Safety events were assessed during the short-term (duration ‚â§ 12 months) and cumulative (short-term plus longterm extensions) abatacept treatment periods. Incidence rates per 100 patient-years were calculated. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for hospitalized infections and malignancies were compared with external RA cohorts and, for malignancies, with the US general population.
RESULTS: There were 3173 IV abatacept-treated patients with 2331 patient-years of exposure in the short-term periods, and 4149 IV abatacept-treated patients with 12,132 patient-years of exposure in the cumulative period. Incidence rates for serious infections were low and consistent over time (3.68 for abatacept vs 2.60 for placebo during the short-term, and 2.87 for abatacept during the cumulative period). Hospitalized infections were generally similar to external RA patient cohorts and were consistent over time. Incidence rates of malignancies were similar for abatacept- and placebo-treated patients during the short-term period (0.73 vs 0.59) and remained low during the abatacept cumulative period (0.73). SIR of some tissue-specific malignancies (e.g., colorectal and breast) in the cumulative period tended to be lower, while others (lymphoma and lung) tended to be higher, compared with the general population; however, incidence rates were comparable with RA cohorts. Autoimmune events were rare and infusion reactions uncommon.
CONCLUSION: Longterm safety of IV abatacept was consistent with the short-term, with no unexpected events and low incidence rates of serious infections, malignancies, and autoimmune events."

Despite current screening and (pre-biologic) therapeutic options, 10-15% of children develop bilateral visual impairment. Tumour necrosis factor alpha plays a pathogenic role in JIA-uveitis. No controlled trials have determined the impact of biologic therapy in JIA-associated uveitis. This double blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial assessed the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab in JIA-associated uveitis. Methods: Patients aged 2 to 18 years with active JIA-associated uveitis, despite stable methotrexate (MTX) treatment for at least 12 weeks, were randomly assigned to adalimumab or placebo in a ratio of 2:1. All patients were treated up to a maximum period of 18 months, with follow up of 2 years from randomisation. All patients received a stable dose of MTX and in addition either adalimumab (20 mg for patients weighing <30 kg or 40 mg for patients weighing >30 kg, subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks) or placebo. Primary endpoint was ""time to treatment failure"" defined by the ""Standardisation of the Uveitis Nomenclature"" criteria. Ten secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed including quality of life variables and arthritis disease activity measures. Adverse events from both arms were collected. Statistical analysis of the primary outcome used the log rank test to compare treatment groups with a hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval also being reported. Results: The trial was stopped early for efficacy after 90 patients had been randomised as interim analysis met the pre-specified statistical stopping guidelines. The final analysis of the primary outcome showed positive treatment effect in favour of adalimumab: hazard ratio (HR) 0.27 (95% CI 0.13-0.52); p<0.0001. Adverse events were experienced by 88.3% (53/60, 687 events) of patients in the adalimumab group and 90% (27/30, 144 events) of patients in the placebo group. Events were consistent with the known adalimumab profile. 15 serious adverse events (SAEs) most commonly infection (10 events) occurred in 21.7% (n=13) of the patients in the adalimumab group, 3 of these resulted in the patient being withdrawn from treatment and there were 2 SAEs (flare of uveitis) reported in 6.7% (n=2) patients in the placebo group (both patients were withdrawn from the trial). Conclusion: This trial, the largest of its kind to be conducted in JIA-associated uveitis, provides evidence of efficacy of adalimumab treatment used in addition to methotrexate in this population. The safety profile of adalimumab was consistent with that previously reported for adalimumab. University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust was contracted to receive a sum under data sharing agreement. This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project 09/51/01) and Arthritis Research UK (grant reference 19612). Adalimumab was provided by Abbvie which reviewed this abstract and provided comments for author consideration. Trial protocol design and analyses were undertaken independent of AbbVie."

Methods: Patients were recruited from 5 centers and through advertisement. Inclusion criteria were: (i) age >18 years (ii) diagnosis of RA by a rheumatologist (iii) disease duration <10 years (iii) adequate cognitive status and, (iv) ability to communicate in English or Spanish language. The efficacy of the MM-PtET was evaluated longitudinally using questionnaires on disease knowledge, decisional conflict and role preferences, self-efficacy and disease management before and after viewing the assigned materials, at 3 and 6 months. Linear regression and generalized estimating equation were used in order to determine the effective impact of correlative factors on the efficacy of the MM-PtET, including age, sex, race, education level, language in which the questionnaire was answered, health literacy and disease duration. Results: 221 participants were randomized (111=MM-PtET, 110=written booklet). Mean age was 51+/-13 years, mean disease duration was 5+/-3 years, 85% were female 24% had inadequate health literacy levels and 46% answered the questionnaire in Spanish. 116 (64=MM-PtET, 52=booklet) and 158 (76=MM-PtET, 82=booklet) participants returned their questionnaires at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Within groups most outcomes were improved from baseline to 3 and 6 months. At 6 months, participants assigned to the intervention group had statistically significantly higher disease management scores compared to the control group (mean 81.1 vs 76.6, p=0.03). Greater improvement in knowledge scores from baseline to 6 months were observed in those participants who received the intervention (p=0.03) and those with inadequate health literacy (p=0.006). Meanwhile, among Whites, the intervention was associated with greater improvements in the decisional conflict scale and uninformed subscale (p=0.004 and p=0.02, respectively); and among males, receiving the intervention group led to improvement in the clarity subscale (p=0.02). Among younger individuals, booklet was associated with improvement in self-efficacy but among older ones, it was MM-PtET (p=0.003). Shorter disease duration, on the other hand, was associated with better disease management (p=0.009). Higher level of education (High School or above) was associated with active role played in health decision-making (p<0.003) after adjusting for correlated outcome data and controlling for other variables. Conclusion: Our MM-PtET was more effective in improving disease management compared to reading written materials in RA patients at 6 months. The multimedia tool was associated with greater health outcomes improvement among older patients, Whites, and males. Independent factors associated with improvement include disease duration (shorter) and level of education (at least High School diploma)."

PK profile and clinical data up to week 24 has been reported at ACR 20131. Additional safety and efficacy were evaluated to confirm similarity between CT-P10 and RTX up to 72 weeks (NCT01534884). Methods: Patients with active RA (1987 ACR criteria) and intolerant or unresponsive to anti TNF-a blocker were randomized 2:1 to receive 2 infusions (1,000 mg, IV each) of either CT-P10 or RTX, at a 2-week interval, in combination with methotrexate (MTX) and folic acid. The second course of treatment was initiated between weeks 24 ~ 48 based on disease activity and predefined safety criteria. The end of study visit for patients who did not receive the second course of treatment was conducted at week 48 (Figure 1). Efficacy was analyzed in per-protocol population. Results: Of 154 patients randomized at baseline, 132 (85.7%) patients completed the study. The efficacy in terms of DAS28 changes and overall safety were comparable between CT-P10 and RTX treatment groups. The mean decreases from baseline in DAS28 at Week 24 after 1st and 2nd courses of treatment were similar between CT-P10 and RTX treatment groups (Table 1). The proportion of patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE), serious AE, infusion related reaction, infection, malignancy or lymphoma and discontinuation due to AE was similar between CT-P10 and RTX treatment groups (Table 2). Cervix carcinoma stage 0 was reported in a patient from RTX group, and no deaths were reported. B-cell kinetics between the CT-P10 and RTX treatment groups were similar at all time points.

OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to evaluate the comparative safety and effectiveness of lumbar total disc replacement (TDR) in the treatment of patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease (DDD) who are unresponsive to nonsurgical therapy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: lumbar TDR has been used to alleviate discogenic pain and dysfunction while preserving segmental range of motion and restoring stability. There is a paucity of data available regarding the comparative performance of lumbar TDR.
METHODS: patients presenting with symptomatic single-level lumbar DDD who failed at least 6 months of nonsurgical management were randomly allocated (2: 1) to treatment with an investigational TDR device (activL, n = 218) or FDA-approved control TDR devices (ProDisc-L or Charit√©, n = 106). The hypothesis of this study was that a composite effectiveness outcome at 2 years in patients treated with activL would be noninferior (15% delta) to that in controls.
RESULTS: the primary composite endpoint of this study was met, which demonstrated that the activL TDR was noninferior to control TDR (P < 0.001). A protocol-defined analysis of the primary composite endpoint also confirmed that activL was superior to controls (P = 0.02). Radiographic success was higher with activL versus controls (59% vs. 43%; P < 0.01). Mean back pain severity improved by 74% with activL and 68% with controls. Oswestry Disability Index scores decreased by 67% and 61% with activL and controls, respectively. Patient satisfaction with treatment was over 90% in both groups at 2 years. Return to work was approximately 1 month shorter (P = 0.08) with activL versus controls. The rate of device-related serious adverse events was lower in patients treated with activL versus controls (12% vs. 19%; P = 0.13). Surgical reintervention rates at the index level were comparable (activL 2.3%, control 1.9%).
CONCLUSION: the single-level activL TDR is safe and effective for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar DDD through 2 years.

9261779,,10.1016/j.artres.2014.09.093,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory condition associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The aetiology is most likely multi-factorial, including endothelial dysfunction, caused by uncoupling of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). We hypothesised that oral tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential co-factor for eNOS, would lead to an improvement of endothelial function and subsequently, aortic stiffness. Methods: This was a randomised, double-blinded crossover study, consisting of two separate regimes, 1: a single dose of BH4 400mgvs. placebo and 2: a one-week treatment with BH4 400mg OD vs. placebo. In study 1, aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), and flow mediated dilatation (FMD) were studied before and 3 hours after BH4 supplementation and placebo. In study 2, FMD and aPWV were assessed four times, separated by a week. Results: A single dose of BH4, but not placebo, improved endothelial dysfunction (+3.57+/-4.14 vs.+0.05+/-1.17%, P=0.03; n=18). There was no change in aPWV following BH4 or placebo (-0.13+/-0.58 vs. -0.21+/-0.43m/s; P=0.6). One-week treatment with BH4, improved endothelial function, whereas placebo did not (+3.69+/-4.90 vs. +0.19+/-2.51%, P=0.02; n=15). There was no change in aPWV following BH4 or placebo (-0.22+/-1.3 vs. -0.25+/-0.51m/s, P=0.4) and no correlation between change in aPWV and FMD in either regime. Conclusion: Both acute and chronic BH4 supplementation lead to an improvement of endothelial function, but did not reduce aortic stiffness. This suggests that there is no causality between endothelial function and aortic stiffness and that these conditions may just exist in parallel, both influences by common risk factors, such as inflammation."

Current treatments for OA are severely limited and a large proportion of people with OA live in constant, debilitating pain. There is therefore an urgent need for novel treatments to reduce pain. Synovitis is highly prevalent in OA and is associated with pain. In inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate (MTX) is the gold standard treatment for synovitis and has a well-known, acceptable toxicity profile. We propose that using MTX to treat patients with symptomatic knee OA will be a practical and safe treatment to reduce synovitis and, consequently, pain.
METHODS/DESIGN: pain Reduction with Oral Methotrexate in knee Osteoarthritis, a pragmatic phase III trial of Treatment Effectiveness (PROMOTE) is an investigator-initiated, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, pragmatic placebo-controlled trial. A total of 160 participants with symptomatic knee OA will be recruited across primary and secondary care sites in the United Kingdom and randomized on a 1: 1 basis to active treatment or placebo, in addition to usual care, for 12¬†months. As is usual practice for MTX, dosing will be escalated over six weeks to 25¬†mg (or maximum tolerated dose) weekly for the remainder of the study. The primary endpoint is change in average knee pain during the past week (measured on an 11-point numerical rating scale) between baseline and six months. Secondary endpoints include other self-reported pain, function and quality-of-life measures. A health economics analysis will also be performed. A magnetic resonance imaging substudy will be conducted to provide an explanatory mechanism for associated symptom change by examining whether MTX reduces synovitis and whether this is related to symptom change. Linear and logistic regression will be used to compare changes between groups using univariable and multivariable modelling analyses. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.
DISCUSSION: the PROMOTE trial is designed to examine whether MTX is an effective analgesic treatment for OA. The MRI substudy will address the relationship between synovitis and symptom change. This will potentially provide a much needed new treatment for knee OA.

9261785,,10.1111/psyp.12570,"Exploring autonomic nervous system (ANS) changes during hypnosis is critical for understanding the nature and extent of the hypnotic phenomenon and for identifying the mechanisms underlying the effects of hypnosis in different medical conditions. To assess ANS changes during hypnosis, electrodermal activity and pulse rate variability (PRV) were measured in 121 young adults. Participants either received hypnotic induction (hypnosis condition) or listened to music (control condition), and both groups were exposed to test suggestions. Blocks of silence and experimental sound stimuli were presented at baseline, after induction, and after de-induction. Skin conductance level (SCL) and high frequency (HF) power of PRV measured at each phase were compared between groups. Hypnosis decreased SCL compared to the control condition; however, there were no group differences in HF power. Furthermore, hypnotic suggestibility did not moderate ANS changes in the hypnosis group. These findings indicate that hypnosis reduces tonic sympathetic nervous system activity, which might explain why hypnosis is effective in the treatment of disorders with strong sympathetic nervous system involvement, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hot flashes, hypertension, and chronic pain. Further studies with different control conditions are required to examine the specificity of the sympathetic effects of hypnosis."

The TRACTISS trial aimed to determine the extent to which rituximab improves symptoms of fatigue and oral dryness in patients with PSS. Methods: multicentre, randomised, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with PSS, and symptomatic fatigue and oral dryness were recruited from 25 rheumatology clinics in the UK from june 2012 to january 2014. At weeks 0, 2, 24 and 26, patients received pre- and post-infusion corticosteroids and either placebo (P) IV or rituximab (R) IV (1000mg in 250ml). Intervention was decided by 24hr central telephone minimisation service. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving 30% reduction in either fatigue or oral dryness at 48 weeks, measured by visual analogue scale (VAS). Other outcomes included VAS scales for fatigue or oral dryness separately, global assessment of PSS activity, pain, ocular and overall dryness, AS well AS salivary and lachrymal flow rates, quality of life, EULAR sjogren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) and patient reported index (ESSPRI). Patients and physicians were blinded to the patient's allocation. ISRCTN 65360827 results: all patients (n=133) randomised to P (n=66) and to R (n=67) were included in the primary analysis. 55 P and 54 R patients received all 4 infusions in full. Mean age was 54 years, 93% of patients were female, mean ESSDAI was 5.7 and mean time since diagnosis was 5.7 years. Among complete cases at 48 weeks, 21/56 P and 24/61 R patients achieved the primary endpoint. After multiple imputation of missing outcomes, response rates were 36.8% (P) and 39.8% (R) (adjusted odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.50- 2.55). There were no significant differences in any outcome measure, except unstimulated salivary flow: p patients deteriorated compared to R patients with a significant relative difference seen after week 24. There were more adverse events reported in total for R (275 P vs 325 R), but no difference in serious adverse events. (10 vs 10) one serious infusion reaction (R) and one serious anaphylaxis (P) occurred in one patient each. Conclusion: TRACTISS is the largest randomised trial of biologic therapy in PSS. No improvement in symptoms was seen in the rituximab arm (unlike the TEARS study) but modest benefit for rituximab in salivary flow was observed. (table presented)"

However, because of heterogeneity and complexity of RA disease course and potential toxicity of therapies, shared decision-making (SDM) between physician and patient is central to patient safety and outcomes. Patient education (PE) is a useful tool for patient empowerment, since patients should aware of their disease course, treatment target, medications and their adverse effects. However, it is uncertain that how we can measure the clinical benefits of PE and WHO should BE responsible for educating patients. This study aims to examine the impact of PE on the patients' satisfaction in RA patients and to compare the nurse-led education with physician-led education for RA patients. Methods: patients were enrolled by categorizing in three according to their clinical characteristics: early RA patient (<2 years of disease duration) with conventional dmards (group I), established RA patients (> 2 years of disease duration) with conventional dmards (group II), and RA patients treated with biologic dmards (group III). After constructing two groups of nurse-led and physician-led education, stratified randomization was performed by randomly assigning the two education groups separately within each group by characteristics. Patient education materials were composed of the characteristics and outcomes of RA, T2T, treatment options with side effects, and comorbidities. Two times of face-to-face education was performed and changes in patient satisfaction before and after PE were assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100mm) and leeds satisfaction questionnaire (LSQ) score. Changes of patients' outcomes were measured using DAS28-ESR, HAQ-DI, and EQ-5D scores. Changes of patients' satisfaction and disease outcomes between before and after PE were compared using paired t-test, and the comparison between nurse-led and physicianled education was analyzed using independent t-test. Results: a total of 120 RA patients, 40 patients from each groups, were randomized to receive either nurse-led or physician-led education. Among them, 113 patients completely received twice face-to-face education and final assessment with 1 or 2 month interval: 38, 36, and 39 patients in group I, II, and III, respectively. In total patients, patients' satisfaction by PE was significantly increased from 87.8 (+/- 13.1) to 92.3(+/- 8.8) in VAS (p<0.01), and from 3.7 (+/- 0.4) to 4.0 (+/- 0.4) in LSQ score (p<0.01). The improvement of patients' satisfaction measured with LSQ was highest in group I (0.45 +/- 0.45) and followed by group II (0.22 +/- 0.34) and group III (0.19 +/- 0.38). However, there was no improvement in DAS28-ESR, HAQ, or quality of life after PE. Improvement of patients' satisfaction by LSQ after nurse-led education was 0.37 +/- 0.37 and it was higher than 0.27+/-0.45 after physician-led education, but it was not statistically different (P =0.25). Conclusion: patient education in outpatient clinic for RA patients improved patients' satisfaction, especially in patients with early stage. Nurse-led education showed comparable improvement in patients' satisfaction with physician-led education"

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), increased concentrations of IL-6 may stimulate leukocyte recruitment to the joint and promote osteoclast maturation and activation, contributing to joint damage. Sirukumab is a human anti-il-6 monoclonal antibody under development for RA treatment. This study was sponsored by janssen in collaboration with GSK. Methods: the primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of sirukumab monotherapy in japanese subjects with moderate to severe RA. The study consisted of a 52-week double-blind treatment phase and a 16-week post-treatment phase. In total, 122 subjects were randomized 1: 1 to sirukumab 50mg every 4 weeks (q4) or sirukumab 100mg every 2 weeks (q2). No disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) were permitted until week 24. Results: of the 122 subjects randomized in the 50mg q4 group and the 100mg q2 group, respectively: 77.0% and 70.5% were female; mean weights were 55.0 and 56.8 kg; mean disease durations were 7.60 and 7.95 years; and 14 and 10 subjects had experienced treatment with previous biologics (table 1). Safety: in 122 treated subjects, 56 subjects in the 50mg q4 group and 58 subjects in the 100mg q2 group experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE); there was no marked difference between the 2 groups. In addition, 9 subjects in the 50mg q4 group and 5 subjects in the 100mg q2 group discontinued the study agent due to aes; 23 subjects in the 50mg q4 group and 24 subjects in the 100mg q2 group experienced injection site reactions, and 1 subject discontinued due to it. There were no deaths, major adverse cardiac events, or serious gastrointestinal perforations. Serious aes (saes) were observed in 4 subjects in the 50mg q4 group and 5 subjects in the 100mg q2 group (table 2). Saes of ""osteomyelitis"", ""borderline serous tumor of ovary"", and ""acute sinusitis"" were mild or moderate, and considered reasonably related to the study drug. Efficacy: at week 24, the proportions of ACR20/50/70 responses were 73.8/49.2/24.6% in the 50mg q4 group and 82.0/63.9/36.1% in the 100mg q2 group. ACR responses were generally maintained through week 52. Conclusion: sirukumab 50mg q4 and 100mg q2 monotherapy dose regimens for 52 weeks were well tolerated in japanese RA patients. The proportions of aes in both groups were similar and there were no dose-dependent safety issues. The proportions of ACR 20/50/70 responses at week 24 in the 100mg q2 group were numerically higher than those in the 50mg q4 group; however, the number of subjects was too limited to make conclusions about dose response.

Previous dose-ranging studies in RA demonstrated the clinical efficacy of etoricoxib 90 mg vs placebo (PBO). In these studies, etoricoxib 60 mg demonstrated some clinically meaningful treatment effects, therefore the current study further evaluated the efficacy of etoricoxib 60 mg and 90 mg in RA. Methods: this was a 2-part, double-blind, PBO controlled study in RA. Part I (6 weeks) assessed the efficacy of etoricoxib 60 mg and 90 mg vs PBO. Part II (6 weeks) evaluated whether subjects with inadequate pain relief on etoricoxib 60 mg in part I benefitted from increasing to etoricoxib 90 mg in part II. Patients were >18 years of age, with a diagnosis of RA >6 months prior to screening and prior clinical response to nsaids. Patients were required to have a disease flare after NSAID washout prior to randomization. Eligible patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: PBO in part I; etoricoxib 60 mg in part I & II; etoricoxib 60 mg in part I followed by 90 mg in part II; or etoricoxib 90 mg in part I in a 2: 7: 7: 8 ratio, respectively. Primary endpoints were disease activity score evaluating 28 joints and C reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) index and patient global assessment of pain (PGAP) score (0-100 MM VAS) after 6 weeks of treatment in part I. Safety and tolerability measures included independent adjudication of all thrombotic cardiovascular and serious upper GI aes. Results: in total, 1404 patients were randomized; 83.5% were female; the mean age was 53.8 years, 75.4% were caucasian, 1228 patients completed part I and 713 patients continued to part II. Both 60 mg and 90 mg etoricoxib were superior to PBO for the treatment of RA on both primary efficacy endpoints: change from baseline DAS28-CRP score (table 1A) and change from baseline PGAP score (table 1B). For DAS28-CRP, there was no significant treatment difference between etoricoxib 90 mg and 60 mg (table 1A). Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a small, but statistically significant decrease in baseline PGAP score AS compared to 60 mg (table 1B). In part II, inadequate pain responders did not experience a significant decrease in PGAP score after increasing the etoricoxib dose from 60 mg to 90 mg compared to inadequate pain responders WHO stayed on 60 mg (table 1C). In both etoricoxib 90 mg and 60 mg groups, the incidence of saes and drug-related aes were similar between the two treatment groups. Conclusion: both etoricoxib 90 mg and 60 mg are superior to PBO in relieving the symptoms of RA. Etoricoxib 90 mg vs 60 mg resulted in a statistically significant, though small, improvement in PGAP score, but not DAS28-CRP. Dose escalation from 60 mg to 90 mg in pain inadequate responders did not significantly improve efficacy. Both etoricoxib 90 mg and 60 mg were well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified. (table presented)"

This study aimed to determine the effects of progressive muscle relaxation on the quality of lifein rapatients. Materials and methods: this clinical trial was conducted in a rheumatologist office on 62 RA patients. Subjects were randomlydivided into two groups of progressive muscle relaxation and control. Subjects in the experimental group exercised 20 minutes daily for eight weeks, while no intervention was madein the control group. Data collection was performedusing demographic and SF-36 questionnairesat the beginning and end of the intervention. Data analysis was performed using SPSS V.19. Results: in this study,mean of quality of life score in the experimentalgroup changed from 37.84 to 54.54 after the intervention (p<0.000), while it changed from 37.47 to 43.20 in the control group. Therefore, the difference was not considered AS significant (p=0.112).

This secondary analysis evaluated the impact of a weight loss intervention on comorbid medical conditions immediately following an intervention (12 months) and 1-year postintervention (24 months) using data from the exercise and nutrition to enhance recovery and good health for you (ENERGY) trial-a phase III trial which was aimed at and successfully promoted weight loss. Methods: ENERGY randomized 692 overweight/obese women WHO had completed treatment for early stage breast cancer to either a 1-year group-based behavioral intervention designed to achieve and maintain weight loss or to a less intensive control intervention. Minimal support was provided postintervention. New medical conditions, medical conditions in which non-cancer medications were prescribed, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits, were compared at baseline, year 1, and year 2. Changes over time were analyzed using chi-squared tests, kaplan-meier, and logistic regression analyses. Results: at 12 months, women randomized to the intervention had fewer new medical conditions compared to the control group (19.6 vs. 32.2 %, p < 0.001); however, by 24 months, there was no longer a significant difference. No difference was observed in each of the four conditions for which non-cancer medications were prescribed, hospital visits, or emergency visits at either 12 or 24 months. Conclusions: these results support a short-term benefit of modest weight loss on the likelihood of comorbid conditions; however, recidivism and weight regain likely explain no benefit at 1-year postintervention follow-up"

High intensity interval training (HIIT) is known to be effective in improving cardiovascular health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 10 weeks of HIIT at 85-95% of HRmax would improve important risk factors of CVD in rheumatic patients, and if these patients would tolerate exercise intensities above today's recommendations. // METHODS: Seven women with RA and eleven with adult-JIA, 20-50 years, were recruited to this cross-over study. Participants performed HIIT, consisting of 4 x 4 min intervals at 85-95% of HRmax twice a week for 10 weeks on spinning bikes. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), heart rate recovery, blood pressure, body composition, and blood variables were measured before and after the exercise and control period. Disease activity was determined and questionnaire data were collected. // RESULTS: HIIT resulted in 12.2% increase in VO2max and 2.9% improvement in heart rate recovery (p < 0.05). BMI, body fat, and waist circumference decreased 1.2, 1.0, and 1.6%, respectively, whereas muscle mass increased 0.6% (p < 0.05). A trend toward decreased CRP was detected after HIIT (p = 0.08). No changes were detected in disease activity or pain. // CONCLUSION: Despite rigorous high intensity exercise, no increase was detected in disease activity or pain, indicating that HIIT was well tolerated by these patients. Furthermore, HIIT had positive effects on several CVD risk factors. In light of this pilot study, HIIT seems like a promising non-pharmacological treatment strategy for patients with RA and adult-JIA."

It has been proposed that remission should BE maintained throughout the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the evidence supporting this is limited. Physical function measured by the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) is a major outcome in RA, and HAQ is shown to BE one of the strongest predictors of longterm outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the physical function over a long time in patients with RA WHO achieved sustained remission (SR) compared with that of patients occasionally achieving remission . Methods. Patients with RA treated with antitumor necrosis factor and included in the south swedish arthritis treatment group register were eligible for this study. We identified patients with a disease activity score at 28 joints (DAS28) < 2.6 or simplified disease activity index (SDAI) < 3.3 at some point and those WHO achieved SR, i.e., remission during consecutive visits for at least 6 months. The course of functional status was assessed using the HAQ at each visit. Results. Of the 2416 patients, 1177 (48.7%) reached DAS28 remission at some point. SR was achieved by 382 (15.8%) for the DAS28 and 186 (7.7%) for the SDAI criteria. Comparing the SR and NSR groups, HAQ improved during the first 12 months in the DAS28 remission. HAQ continued to improve relatively AS long AS SR was maintained. A higher proportion of patients in SR reached full physical function. Conclusion. In patients with established RA, physical function measured by the HAQ improves in patients reaching SR compared with patients WHO only occasionally reach remission. The improvement continues while in remission, which supports that maintaining remission should BE a treatment goal"

Decisions about having children or expanding their family require relevant knowledge and consultation with their family and physician as conception and pregnancy has to be managed within the RA context. Relevant information is not readily available to women with RA. Therefore a randomized controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a new motherhood decision aid (DA) developed specifically for women with RA.
METHODS: one hundred and forty-four women were randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group. All women completed a battery of questionnaires at pre-intervention, including, the Pregnancy in Rheumatoid Arthritis Questionnaire (PiRAQ), the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES), and provided basic demographic information. Women in the DA group were sent an electronic version of the DA, and completed the battery of questionnaires for a second time post-intervention.
RESULTS: women who received the DA had a 13¬†% increase in relevant knowledge (PiRAQ) scores and a 15¬†% decrease in scores on the decisional conflict (DCS), compared to the control group (1¬†%, 2¬†% respectively). No adverse psychological effects were detected as evident in unchanged levels of depression and anxiety symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: the findings of this study suggest that this DA may be an effective tool in assisting women with RA when contemplating having children or more children.

In this study, we developed a non-pharmacological self-management modular program group intervention and evaluated its efficacy AS an adjunct therapy in patients suffering from early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: patients were randomized to either participate in a non-equivalent intervention group along with the standard of care or only receive standard-of-care treatment at a community rheumatology center. The outcomes measured were a pain visual analog scale (VAS), patient general health (GH) on a VAS, and the short form 36 health survey version 2 scale measuring quality of life. These parameters were evaluated in the first week to obtain baseline values, and at 20, 32, 48, and 60 weeks to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention group. RESULTS: the patients were randomized, with 100 patients in the intervention group and 106 in the control group. The intervention and control groups were similar with regard to the percentage of women (86% vs. 89.6%), tobacco usage (25% vs. 19.8%), mean age (42.6¬±13.2 years vs. 46.6¬±10.9 years), and disease duration (15.3¬±6.7 months vs. 14.5¬±6.6 months). The mean outcomes were significantly different between the two groups, and post-hoc pairwise analysis demonstrated significant deterioration in the control group in contrast to improvement in the intervention group at the second, third, fourth, and fifth evaluations. Improvements were often seen AS early AS the 12-week and 24-week follow-up visits. CONCLUSIONS: epidemiology contributes to the evaluation of how well specific therapies or other health interventions prevent or control health problems. The modular program group intervention implemented in this study appears to BE a suitable and feasible method to facilitate much more comprehensive management of early RA in socioeconomically challenged communities."

Potential anti-inflammatory effects of gnrh-antagonists may BE most pronounced in patients with high gnrh and gonadotropin levels. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and safety of a gnrh-antagonist, cetrorelix, in RA patients with high gonadotropin levels. METHODS: we report intention-to-treat post hoc analyses among patients with high gonadotropin levels (N = 53), i.e. gonadotropin levels>median, from our proof-of-concept, double-blind agra-study (N = 99). Patients with active longstanding RA, randomized to subcutaneous cetrorelix (5mg days1-2; 3mg days 3-5) or placebo, were followed through day 15. Only predefined primary and secondary endpoints were analyzed. RESULTS: the primary endpoint, disease activity score of 28-joint counts with c-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), improved with cetrorelix compared with placebo by day 5 (-1.0 vs. -0.4, p = 0‚àô010).

We aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of blueberry and etanercept for JIA. Two hundred and one JIA patients were selected, and randomly and evenly assigned to three groups: ETA (50 mg of etanercept twice weekly), ETABJ (matched etanercept and 50 ml blueberry juice daily) and ETAPJ (matched etanercept and placebo juice). The severity of JIA was measured using american college of rheumatology scales (ACR) 20, 50 and 70. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL1) alpha and IL1 beta, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA) were measured by qrt-pcr and ELISA. After a 6-month follow-up, the ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 in an ETABJ group were higher than those in other two groups (P < 0.05), suggesting clinically meaningful improvement in JIA. Meanwhile, the symptoms and side effects were reduced significantly or absent in an ETABJ group, including mental diseases, retrobulbar optic neuritis, gaining weight, infection, cutaneous vasculitis, diarrhea, uveitis and pancytopenia. Blueberries reduced the levels of IL1 alpha and beta, and increased the level of IL1RA.

Here, we demonstrate that the magnitude of fracture risk reduction is independent of baseline fracture probability assessed by FRAX.
INTRODUCTION: daily administration of 20 or 40 Œºg teriparatide has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fracture compared with placebo. The aim of the present study was to evaluate fracture risk assessed at baseline using the FRAX¬Æ tool and to determine the efficacy of teriparatide as a function of baseline fracture risk.
METHODS: one thousand six hundred thirty-seven postmenopausal women in the pivotal phase three trial, randomly assigned to receive placebo (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ544), teriparatide 20 Œºg per day (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ541) or teriparatide 40 Œºg per day (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ552), were studied. Baseline clinical risk factors were entered into country-specific FRAX models to compute the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures with or without input of femoral neck BMD. Because there was no difference in effect of 20 and 40 Œºg teriparatide daily on fracture occurrence, the two active groups were merged. The interaction between probability of a major fracture and treatment efficacy was examined by Poisson regression.
RESULTS: the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures (with BMD) ranged from 2.2-67.2 %. Treatment with teriparatide was associated with a 37 % decrease in all non-vertebral fractures (95 % CI 10-56 %) and a 56 % decrease in low-energy non-vertebral fractures (95 % CI 24-75 %) compared with placebo. The risk of morphometric vertebral fractures decreased significantly by 66 % (95 % CI 50-77 %). Hazard ratios for the effect of teriparatide on the fracture outcome did not change significantly with increasing fracture probability (p‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.30). Similar findings were noted for the interaction when BMD was excluded from the FRAX model, or when probability of hip fracture was used as the marker of baseline risk.
CONCLUSION: we conclude that teriparatide significantly decreases the risk of non-vertebral and morphometric vertebral fractures in women by a similar extent, irrespective of baseline fracture probability."

The objectives of this study were to evaluate 1) the effect of febuxostat vs. placebo on joint damage after 2 years of treatment in subjects with early gout and 2) the safety of febuxostat. Methods: subjects with serum urate  >7.0 mg/dl received either febuxostat 40/80 mg or placebo for up to 2 years. Febuxostat was up titrated from 40 to 80 mg at the month 1 visit if sua >6.0 mg/dl at the day 14 visit. Early gout was defined AS having experienced <2 gout flares total, and only 1 flare during the previous 12 months. Joint damage was evaluated utilizing x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). X-rays were assessed using a modified sharp-van der heijde (msvdh) method validated in gout patients. MRI images were assessed using the rheumatoid arthritis MRI scoring (RAMRIS) system. For both x-ray and MRI assessments, the joint with the first gout flare was identified AS the primary affected joint. Contrast-enhanced MRI images were used for scoring of synovitis. Safety assessments included adverse events (aes), serious aes and clinical laboratory measures. Results: at baseline, msvdh erosion score >0 in the primary affected joint was present in 9% of the placebo group and 14% of the febuxostat group. After 2 years of treatment, the placebo and febuxostat groups showed no differences in the changes from baseline in msvdh erosion scores from the primary affected joint or from full hand and foot radiographs. At baseline, RAMRIS synovitis score >0 in the primary affected joint was present in 89% of the placebo group and 94% of the febuxostat group. There was a significant reduction in the RAMRIS synovitis score for the primary affected joint in the febuxostat group compared to the placebo group after 1 (p=0.025) and 2 (p<0.001) years of treatment. The RAMRIS erosion and bone edema scores showed no differences for the primary affected joint comparing febuxostat and placebo groups. The percentage of subjects with sua levels <6.0 mg/dl was 62.8% and 5.7% after 2 years of treatment with febuxostat and placebo, respectively. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) and adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are summarized in table 1. Conclusion: this first clinical trial in early gout subjects demonstrated that treatment with febuxostat can achieve a significant reduction in synovitis compared to placebo.

Arthritis rheumatol 2014;66: 1820-31). However, the drug was associated with dose-dependent effects in the lateral tibio-femoral compartment. Methods: sprifermin was administered in 2 cycles of 3 weekly intra-articular injections at 10, 30, and 100 mug. Mris were assessed semi-quantitatively (sq) by expert radiologists. The post-hoc analysis focused on structural changes in the 100 mug subgroup (n=57) and matching placebo subgroup (n=18) evaluating changes from baseline (BL) up to 12 months. Assessed were cartilage morphology (lesions), bone marrow lesions (bmls), meniscal damage and extrusion, hoffaand effusion-synovitis using the semiquantitative WORMS scoring system. Analyses included multi-dimensional assessment: delta subregional  approach (including number of subregions [srs] showing worsening (>0), no change (0) and improvement (<0), negative values indicating improvement and positive values indicating worsening) and delta-sum [DSM] approach (including total sum of grades for srs showing worsening, no change and improvement). Analyses were performed on a whole knee level and separately for medial and lateral tibio-femoral joints (MTFJ, LTFJ), and patello-femoral joint (PFJ). Mann-whitney-wilcoxon tests assessed differences between treatment groups. P-values were not adjusted for multiple testing. Results: at BL, no significant differences were observed between placebo and treatment groups for all sqmri parameters, except for whole knee cartilage morphology (29.97 +/- [standard deviation] 16.00 for treatment vs 21.11 +/- 14.76 vs placebo, p=0.040). For change in cartilage morphology, statistically significant differences were seen from BL to 12 months using DSR approach, with lower values on sprifermin (corresponding to less worsening) vs placebo for the PFJ (0.22 +/- 0.55 vs treatment 0.02 +/- 0.23, p=0.046), with similar results observed using the DSM approach. Although not statistically significant, less worsening vs placebo was observed in the LTFJ (DSR, 0.11 +/- 0.32 vs treatment 0.05 +/- 0.48). For change in bmls, statistically significant changes from 6 to 12 months were observed for the whole knee, with negative values indicating improvement and positive values worsening (placebo 0.44 +/- 1.20 vs treatment -0.14 +/- 1.24, p=0.042), and borderline for LTFJ (0.22 +/- 0.65 vs treatment -0.05 +/- 0.80 p=0.064) using the DSR approach. No notable changes from BL were observed for remaining analyzed parameters. Conclusion: cartilage morphology showed less worsening from BL to 12 months and bmls showed improvement after 100 ug sprifermin treatment from 6 to 12 months compared to placebo. The potential effect of sprifermin on subchondral bone (bmls) is a novel finding that warrants further exploration. This finding may BE explained by altered loading AS a result of cartilage surface restoration or by direct effects on bone"

METHODS: in this double-blinded, randomized multicenter trial, a total of 174 moderately active RA patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the treatment group (treated with Compound TwHF, 87 cases) and the placebo control group (87 cases). Compound TwHF or placebo was externally applied in painful joints, 20 g each time, once per day for 8 weeks. Self-reported joint pain relief was taken as a primary effective indicator. Visual analogue scale for pain (VAS), disease activity score of 28 joints (DAS28), VAS for general health (GH) were evaluated before treatment, at week 4 and after treatment. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) were tested before and after treatment. Menstrual changes in females were observed during treatment. Skin irritation occurred during the recording process was assessed using skin irritation strength. Intention to treat (ITT) was statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: the joint pain relief rate in the treatment group was 90.8% (79/87 cases), higher than that in the placebo control group (69.0%, 60/87 cases; P = 0.001). VAS pain score, DAS28, VAS for GH score were significantly improved in the two groups at week 4 of treatment and after treatment, as compared with before treatment (P < 0.01). ESR and hs-CRP levels significantly decreased in the treatment group after treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). No difference was found in post-treatment VAS pain score, DAS28, VAS for GH score, ESR, or hs-CRP between the two groups (P > 0.05). Eight adverse events occurred in the treatment group (5 skin allergy, 1 intolerance of medical odor, and 2 mild liver injury), while 3 adverse events occurred in the placebo control group (2 skin allergy, 1 mild liver injury). There was no statistical difference in adverse event between the two groups (P > 0.05). No menstrual change occurred in the treatment group.
CONCLUSION: external applying Compound TwHF was an effective and safe way to relieve-joint pain of RA patients, which could be taken as an adjuvant therapy."

METHODS: eighty eligible obese women (aged 18-45¬†years) were randomly assigned to either ginger or placebo groups (receiving 2¬†g/day of ginger powder or corn starch as two 1¬†g tablets) for 12¬†weeks. Body mass index (BMI) and body composition were assessed every 4¬†weeks, and serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, resistin, insulin and glucose were determined before and after intervention. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were also calculated.
RESULTS: ginger consumption significantly decreased BMI, serum insulin and HOMA-IR index, along with increasing QUICKIs as compared to the placebo. Moreover, significant reductions in serum leptin, resistin and glucose were observed in both groups, especially in ginger group with nonsignificant differences between groups.

Objectives: to determine whether spa therapy plus pharmacological treatment offers any benefit in the management of RA AS compared to pharmacological treatment alone. Methods: we conducted a prospective, controlled, unblinded randomly assigned study of patients with RA according to american college of rheumatology criteria. Following the 2007 recommendations of AFRETH, the method designed for this study was ""immediate treatment versus delayed treatment."" All patients were followed at the oporto hospital centre and each physician observed the same patients throughout the study. Patients continued with their usual medications and maintained their daily life activities at home, at leisure and/ or in the workplace. The spa therapy group received spa treatments for 21 days at S. Jorge spa-santa maria da feira. The main outcome measure was the HAQ-DI; the moderated regression analysis, together with the johnson-neyman technique, was used for statistical analysis. Results: hAQ-DI at the end of treatment (21 days) and at the 3 month follow-up was improved in the spa group (odds ratio 0.37, confidence interval 0.09-0.64, p = 0.01 at 21 days, and 0.44, 0.15-0.72, p = 0.004 at 3 months). Conclusions: in individuals in whom pain (physical and psychological) predominates, any complementary gain in function is beneficial. The main goal is to enhance quality of life.

Telemonitoring patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an emerging concept to guide the collaborative management treatment and improve outcomes in patients. The objective of this study was to investigate whether an intensive treatment strategy, according to a telemonitoring protocol, is more effective than conventional management strategy in reaching remission and comprehensive disease control (CDC) after 1¬†year in early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA) patients. METHODS: forty-four ERA patients were randomly allocated into two groups: the telemonitoring intensive strategy (TIS) group (group 1) or the conventional strategy (CS) group (group 2). Three patients refused to participate. In group 1 (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ21), a remote monitoring system of disease activity, in combination with protocolised treatment adjustments aiming for remission was applied. In group 2 (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ20), patients were treated according to daily clinical practice, with regular evaluation of disease activity, but without protocolised treatment adjustments. A telemedical care called ""remote telemonitoring for managing rheumatologic condition and healtcare programmes"" (RETE-MARCHE), was developed to perform the remote monitoring. RESULTS: a higher percentage of patients in the TIS group achieved CDAI remission vs patients in the CS group (38.1¬†% vs 25¬†% at year 1, p <0.01). Time to achieve remission was significantly shorter in the group 1 than in the group 2, with a median of 20¬†weeks vs a median over 36-weeks (p <0.001). Concordantly, the patients in group 1 showed a greater improvement (p <0.001), compared with group 2 in terms of functional impairment (71.4¬†% vs 35¬†%) and radiological damage progression (23.8¬†% vs 10¬†%), resulting in a greater rate of CDC (19.4¬†% vs 5¬†%). CONCLUSIONS: according to our results, an intensive treatment strategy by telemonitoring leads to more effective disease remission and more rapid CDC than treatment according to conventional management strategy in ERA.

We examined the effect of milnacipran on self-reported pain intensity and experimental pain sensitivity among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with widespread pain and stable RA disease activity. METHODS: in this double-blind, crossover study, patients with RA with widespread pain, receiving a stable treatment regimen, were randomized (by a random number generator) to receive milnacipran 50 mg twice daily or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a 3-week washout and crossed over to the other arm for the remaining 6 weeks. The primary outcome was change in average pain intensity, assessed by the brief pain inventory short form. The sample size was calculated to detect a 30% improvement in pain with power = 0.80 and Œ± = 0.05. RESULTS: of the 43 randomized subjects, 41 received the study drug, and 32 completed the 15-week study per protocol. On a 0-10 scale, average pain intensity decreased by 0.39 (95% CI -1.27 to 0.49, p = 0.37) more points during 6 weeks of milnacipran treatment compared with placebo.

Acupuncture seems to be an alternative to treat pSS and conduces to good symptomatic results. However further research is necessary. This trial is to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture on improving the key symptoms of pSS, which are dryness, pain and fatigue (DPF).
METHODS & DESIGN: the study is designed as a randomized controlled trial of two arms with a single centre. We compare acupuncture with sham acupuncture on symptomatic improvements of pSS. A total of 120 pSS patients, aged at least 18, with DPF, will be randomly assigned to acupuncture or sham acupuncture groups, where they will have needle intervention for 8 weeks with 16 weeks of follow-up. Subjects will be assessed each time before interventions during the 8-week intervention, in week 8 after all interventions and in week 12, 16, 20 and 24 for follow-up with different measurements. The primary outcome are the proportions of subjects that have 30% or greater reduction in at least 2 out of 3 items of DPF in Numeric Analog Scale (NAS) scores (0‚Äâ=‚Äâthe best, 10‚Äâ=‚Äâthe severest), calculated between the baseline and the average scores of week 2 to 8. The secondary outcome are related to individual items of NAS scores, EULAR Sj√∂gren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), EULAR Sj√∂gren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), Schirmer test score and unstimulated salivary flow, serum Immunoglobulin G, A and M levels, Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Salivary glands ultrasounds, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale score. The secondary outcome scores are to be collected at baseline, in week 8, 16, and 24. Besides, individual items of NAS will also be collected in week 12 and 20. Moreover, subjects' satisfaction and the proportion of the subjects who identified their allocation will also be measured and analyzed.
DISCUSSION: this study will be the first randomized and controlled pilot trial of acupuncture on alleviating the symptoms of pSS with relatively long-term follow-up. The result of the study might offer a new option to treat pSS and might be a clinical proof that acupuncture has beneficial effects on pSS.

A total of 210 adult patients with active RA were randomized to receive either 200 mg SBI-087 or placebo (Pbo), according to one of these patterns: SBI/Pbo/Pbo (SBI on Day 1), SBI/SBI/Pbo (SBI days 1 and 15), SBI/Pbo/SBI (SBI days 1 and 84), SBI/SBI/SBI (SBI days 1, 15, and 84), or Pbo/Pbo/Pbo (Pbo all 3 days). All patients were seropositive and taking background methotrexate. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients achieving 20% improvement from baseline at Week 16 by American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20). Other outcomes included 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-C-reactive protein (CRP), physician's and patient's global assessments of disease activity (PGA and PtGA, respectively) and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Peripheral CD19+ B cells were measured by high-sensitivity flow cytometer. Statistical significance was set at 2-sided a 0.10 level. Results. The SBI/SBI/SBI group demonstrated significant improvement in ACR20 and DAS28-CRP from Week 8 onward, sustained improvement in CRP levels from Week 12 onward, and significant improvements in PGA and PtGA in weeks 16 through 24, and in HAQ-DI at Week 24. The SBI/Pbo/Pbo and SBI/SBI/Pbo groups did not meet the primary endpoint but demonstrated improvements in several secondary endpoints. All treatment groups exhibited depletion of peripheral CD19+ B cells throughout the study. Overall, 61.5% of patients receiving SBI-087 and 55.0% of patients receiving Pbo reported adverse events. Conclusion. SBI-087 effectively depleted peripheral CD20 B cells and was well tolerated.

Reduction of Sedentary Behaviour (SB) has been suggested as a mean for improvement of health in patients with chronic diseases and mobility problems. Short-term intervention studies have demonstrated that SB can be reduced by behavioural interventions in healthy populations. However, it remains unexplored whether it is valid for patients with RA also. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy of an individually tailored, theory-based motivational counseling intervention on reducing daily sitting time in sedentary patients with RA. Additionally, to explore whether a reduction in daily sitting time is associated with reduced pain and fatigue, self-reported physical function, self-efficacy, improved health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and cardiovascular biomarker levels, and finally to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
METHODS/DESIGN: for this parallel group randomized trial, 150 patients with RA and at least 5 hours of sitting time per day, will be recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic, and block-randomized to the intervention group or the control group receiving usual care. The intervention includes: 1) individual motivational counseling (in total 3 sessions) on reduction of daily sitting time in combination with 2) individual Short Text Message Service (SMS) reminders over a 16-week intervention period. Primary outcome is change in daily sitting time (minutes) from baseline to 16 weeks measured objectively using an ActivPAL¬Æ Activity Monitor. Secondary outcomes include fatigue, pain, physical function, HR-QoL, self-efficacy, costs and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, anthropometric measures will be included as well as measurement of blood pressure and serum lipids. All outcomes are assessed at baseline and repeated after 16 weeks. Follow-up assessments are made at 6 and 18 months post-intervention.
DISCUSSION: the intervention is simple, non-invasive and may be implemented at low costs. If the study confirms the positive results expected, the intervention might be implemented in clinical practice and potentially transferred to other clinical populations.

Correlations and agreement between MBDA and DAS28-CRP or CDAI scores were lower at week 24 versus baseline. The proportionately smaller magnitude of response observed for MBDA score versus DAS28-CRP may be due to the influence of the increase in IL-6 concentrations on MBDA score. Thus, MBDA scores obtained during TCZ treatment should be interpreted cautiously and in the context of available clinical information"

Patients suffer daily discomforts such as pain, fatigue, stiffness, and mood disturbances. Their exercise capacity is decreased to a variable degree and physical activity levels may be impaired. To prevent long-term cardiovascular risks associated with JIA and medication, it is important to encourage physical activity. To achieve this we developed Rheumates@Work (R@W), a combined internet-based and in person instruction model, an interactive, educational, and cognitive behavioral program. The aim of this study is twofold: to describe the theoretical background and design of R@W based on Pender's Health Promotion Model, and to assess its acceptance.
METHODS: we enrolled 8 to 13-year-old JIA patients, from 3 outpatients clinics in The Netherlands, in R@W. Inclusion criteria were a low disease activity (VAS physician <20¬†mm), comprehension of the Dutch language and absence of relevant co-morbidity. We assessed acceptance by measuring the participants' commitment to the program, the level of interaction on patient's initiative (f.e. mails send by the patient), technical aspects and satisfaction. Commitment was defined as the percentage of participants that completed the assignments and how much encouragement the participants needed for this. Satisfaction was measured with an anonymous questionnaire concerning f.e. time investment and perceived benefits. Costs were monitored.
RESULTS: of the 64 patients we enrolled, 23 boys and 41 girls, 93.8¬†% completed the program. Participant-initiated interaction was seen in 10.7¬†%, 24.7¬†% send a mail because of technical problems. Eighty-two percent of the participants and 99¬†% of the parents liked the program, and 85¬†% of the participants indicated that they had learnt something, or quite a lot. Development costs of the program were low.
CONCLUSION: the HPM is suitable for a behavioral intervention program such as R@W. Acceptance and satisfaction of R@W were high and the costs of the program were low.

Various surgical treatment options are available, however no statistically significant differences have been found between the different surgical treatments. This supports the suggestion that the improvement might be a result of the post-operative rehabilitation rather than the surgery itself. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has become a recognized treatment option for larger cartilage lesions in the knee. Although ACI has been compared to other surgical treatment such as microfracture and mosaicplasty, it has never been directly compared to simple arthroscopic debridement and rehabilitation alone. In this study we want to increase clinical and economic knowledge about autologous chondrocyte implantation compared to arthroscopic debridement and physical rehabilitation in the short and long run.
METHODS/DESIGN: we will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare ACI with simple arthroscopic debridement (AD) and physiotherapy for the treatment of cartilage lesions in the knee. The study will include a total of 82 patients, both men and non-pregnant women, with a full thickness cartilage defect in the weight bearing area of the femoral condyles or trochlea larger than 2¬†cm2. The lesion must be symptomatic, with a Lysholm score less than 75. The two treatment groups will receive identical rehabilitation protocol according to a modification of Wondrasch et al., which is an active rehabilitation and education program divided into 3 phases: accommodation, rehabilitation and return to activity. The patients will be followed for 24¬†months, with additional late follow-ups at 5 and 10¬†years to monitor the potential onset of osteoarthtitis. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in the KOOS knee-related quality of life (QoL) subscore in the ACI group compared to the AD group at 2¬†years. A combination of self-explanatory questionnaires, clinical parameters, clinical hop tests and radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used as secondary endpoints.
DISCUSSION: this is the first study with a high level of evidence to compare ACI with simple debridement and physiotherapy for the treatment of isolated symptomatic full thickness lesions of the knee.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), fatigue is rated as one of the most common and disabling symptoms. In the present trial, we investigated the effect of A. paniculata on relapse rate and fatigue in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients receiving interferon beta.
METHODS: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessed the effects of 170¬†mg of A. paniculata dried extract tablet b.i.d. p.o. on relapse rate and fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scores (FSS) over 12¬†months in RRMS patients receiving interferon. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, inflammatory parameters and radiological findings were also investigated. Twenty-five patients were enrolled, and twenty-two patients were ultimately analysed and randomised to the active or placebo group.
RESULTS: patients treated with A. paniculata showed a significant reduction in their FSS score as compared to the placebo, equivalent to a 44¬†% reduction at 12¬†months. No statistically significant differences were observed for relapse rate, EDSS or inflammatory parameters, with a trend in reducing new lesions among the A. paniculata group. One patient in the A. paniculata group presented with a mild and transient skin rash, which was alleviated with anti-histamine treatment for three weeks.
CONCLUSION: a. paniculata was well tolerated in patients and no changes in clinical parameters were observed. A. paniculata significantly reduces fatigue in patients with RRMS receiving interferon beta in comparison to placebo and only interferon beta treatment.

Variation in sampling error between treatment alternatives (e.g., treatments have similar average risks, but one treatment has a larger confidence interval) can result in patients failing to choose the option that is best for them. The aim of this study is to use a discrete choice experiment to describe how 2 methods for conveying imprecision in risk influence people's treatment decisions.
METHODS: we randomized a representative sample of the Canadian general population to 1 of 3 surveys that sought choices between hypothetical treatments for rheumatoid arthritis based on different levels of 7 attributes: route and frequency of administration, chance of benefit, serious and minor side effects and life expectancy, and imprecision in benefit and side-effect estimates. The surveys differed in the way imprecision was described: 1) no imprecision, 2) quantitative description based on a range with a visual graphic, and 3) qualitative description simply describing the confidence in the evidence.
RESULTS: the analyzed data were from 2663 respondents. Results suggested that more people understood imprecision when it was described qualitatively (88%) versus quantitatively (68%). Respondents who appeared to understand imprecision descriptions placed high value on increased precision regarding the actual benefits and harms of treatment, equivalent to the value placed on the information about the probability of serious side effects. Both qualitative and quantitative methods led to small but significant increases in decision uncertainty for choosing any treatment. Limitations included some issues in defining understanding of imprecision and the use of an internet survey of panel members.
CONCLUSIONS: these findings provide insight into how conveying imprecision information influences patient treatment choices."

To assess the use of electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROM) in standard clinical practice for early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management, the ePROM ability to enhance clinical care, and how computing technology can improve the patients' adherence to therapy. Methods. In a double-blinded randomized-controlled study, 211 patients with early RA diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria completed a PROM in paper format at their first clinic visit. Patients were then randomized to Group 1, which completed an ePROM questionnaire monthly, or Group 2, which continued the standard paper PROM format. Over a 12-month period, Group 1 patients were assessed every 3 months in the clinic, whereas Group 2 patients were assessed in the clinic initially monthly for 6 months, then every 3 months. The primary endpoint was the equivalence of outcomes  in both groups. The secondary endpoint was the patients' adherence to their medications. Results. There was no significant difference between disease activity measures as well as DAS28 and RAPID-3 scores at 3, 6, and 12 months of management, although there was a trend toward lower patient-reported tender joint count and functional disability score in the active group versus the control group. The patients' adherence to antirheumatic therapy was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the ePROM group, whereas stopping disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for intolerability was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the control group at 12 months of treatment. Conclusion. We found ePROM equivalent to standard paper PROM format. Further, it enabled the patients to personally monitor how they are doing regarding their disease activity and helped to optimize their adherence to their treatment.

This work characterized the pharmacokinetics of ABT-494 across completed phase I trials in healthy subjects and phase IIb trials in subjects with RA. METHODS: data from three ABT-494 phase I studies  and two 12-week phase II studies (3 to 18 mg BID in both studies and 24 mg once daily in one study) in subjects with RA were included in the analysis. ABT-494 was administered in these studies as an immediate-release formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS: in healthy volunteers using reference covariate values, the estimates [95% confidence interval] for ABT-494 apparent clearance, apparent steady-state volume of distribution, absorption lag time, and mean absorption time were 39.7 [37.8-41.5] L/hr, 210 [196-231] L, 0.48 [0.47-0.49] hr, 0.08 [0.04-0.12] hr, respectively.

9262146,,10.4162/nrp.2015.9.2.186,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an excess mortality from cardiovascular disease which is likely attributed to an atherogenic lipid profile. Among nutritional factors vitamin K has been recently focused as a pivotal nutrient in improvement of lipid related markers. Thus, this study was designed to determine the effects of vitamin K on lipid profile in this disease. SUBJECTS/METHODS: fifty eight patients with definitive RA were participated in the present double blind placebo controlled study. They were randomly allocated into two groups to receive vitamin K1 as phylloquinone  (n = 30) or placebo pills (n = 28), for eight weeks. In order to control the effects of probable confounders dietary intakes, anthropometric measurements including weight and height, clinical status using disease activity score-28 (DAS-28), physical activity and anxiety status were evaluated at baseline. Moreover, serum levels of lipid related markers including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) were measured at baseline and at the end of intervention. RESULTS: there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding any of the baseline characteristics. After adjusting for some relevant confounders, in comparison between two groups, we observed no significant changes in lipid related markers at the end of intervention. Also, there was no significant difference between before and after intervention values within groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: function of vitamin K1 in lipid profile modification remains still controversial. This study showed that vitamin K1 has no effect on lipid profile in women with rheumatoid arthritis.

RA therapy is still a challenge for rheumatologists; however, new antirheumatic drugs may be a treatment option for disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-experienced patients with active RA.
OBJECTIVES: the present study is a prospective trial that aims to investigate the effects of therapy with iguratimod plus methotrexate (MTX) in comparison with iguratimod or MTX monotherapy in DMARD-experienced adult patients with active RA.
METHODS: a total of 131¬†patients (24 men, 107 women, mean age 46.63‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ10.61 years) with a history of being treated with traditional DMARDs were investigated. In all, 44¬†patients were treated with iguratimod (25¬†mg, twice daily, orally) plus MTX (a weekly dose of 10¬†mg, orally), 38¬†patients received iguratimod (25¬†mg, twice daily, orally), or 49¬†patients received MTX (weekly dose of 10¬†mg, orally) for 24¬†weeks.
RESULTS: a therapeutic effect with iguratimod was observed between 4 and 10 weeks after treatment initiation and was effective even in patients who had a poor response to previous treatment with DMARDs. The combination of iguratimod with MTX was superior to iguratimod or MTX monotherapy.
CONCLUSION: the data imply that iguratimod is a welcome addition to the small-molecule drug therapy for DMARD-experienced patients with active RA. Iguratimod (alone or in combination with MTX) is an emerging option for the treatment of DMARD-experienced adult patients with active RA who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of other DMARDs."

Recent studies have provided evidence for antioxidant properties of spa therapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether spa therapy with saline balneotherapy has any influence on the oxidant/antioxidant status in patients with RA and to assess clinical effects of spa therapy. In this investigator-blind randomized controlled trial, we randomly assigned 50 patients in a 1: 1 ratio to spa therapy plus standard drug treatment (spa group) or standard drug treatment alone (control group). Spa group followed a 2-week course of spa therapy regimen consisting of a total of 12 balneotherapy sessions in a thermal mineral water pool at 36-37¬†¬∞C for 20¬†min every day except Sunday. All clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed at baseline and after spa therapy (2¬†weeks). The clinical parameters were pain intensity, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI), Disease Activity Score for 28-joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-4). Oxidative status parameters were malondialdehyde (MDA), nonenzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity (NSSA), antioxidant potential (AOP), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The NSSA levels were increased significantly in the spa group (p¬†=¬†0.003) but not in the control group (p¬†=¬†0.509); and there was a trend in favor of spa therapy for improvements in NSSA levels compared to control (p¬†=¬†0.091). Significant clinical improvement was found in the spa group compared to the control in terms of patient global assessment (p¬†=¬†0.011), physician global assessment (p¬†=¬†0.043), function (HAQ-DI) (p¬†=¬†0.037), disease activity (DAS28-4) (0.044) and swollen joint count (0.009), and a trend toward improvement in pain scores (0.057). Spa therapy with saline balneotherapy exerts antioxidant effect in patients with RA as reflected by the increase in NSSA levels after spa therapy; whether this antioxidant effect contributes to the clinical improvements observed remains to be verified."
9262188,,10.14789/jmj.62.s79,"Tofacitinib (3-pyrimidin-4-yl)amino]piperidin-1-yl]-3 -oxopropanenitrile) is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor that is approved in countries including Japan and the United States for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and is being developed across the globe for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. In the present study, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model was applied to compare the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib in Japanese and Caucasians to assess the potential impact of ethnicity on the dosing regimen in the two populations. Simulated plasma concentration profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters, i.e. maximum concentration and area under plasma concentration-time curve, in Japanese and Caucasian populations after single or multiple doses of 1 to 30 mg tofacitinib were in agreement with clinically observed data. The similarity in simulated exposure between Japanese and Caucasian populations supports the currently approved dosing regimen in Japan and the United States, where there is no recommendation for dose adjustment according to race. Simulated results for single (1 to 100 mg) or multiple doses (5 mg twice daily) of tofacitinib in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2C19, an enzyme which has been shown to contribute in part to tofacitinib elimination and is known to exhibit higher frequency in Japanese compared to Caucasians, were also in support of no recommendation for dose adjustment in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. This study demonstrated a successful application of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling in evaluating ethnic sensitivity in pharmacokinetics at early stages of development, presenting its potential value as an efficient and scientific method for optimal dose setting in the Japanese population.

The present study was designed to to evaluate the safety of boron supplements when used in pharmacological doses as adjuvant with etanercept in treatment of RA patients. A double blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with 60 days' treatment period was carried out during 8 months at Baghdad Teaching Hospital / (Medical City) Baghdad, Iraq. One hundred eleven patients maintained on Etanercept and other DMARDs with moderate-severe active RA were selected. Eighty RA patients were randomized into 3 groups to receive either 220 mg/day calcium fructoborate (CFB), 55 mg/day sodium tetraborate (NTB) in capsule dosage form (equivalent to 6 mg elemental Boron), or placebo (specially prepared for this purpose) once daily. Only 72 patients completed the study. Blood was obtained from each patient before and after 60 days, and utilized for the measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cells (WBC) count and platelets count, hepatic and renal functions. The results showed that boron supplements have no negative impact of the evaluated markers, and they demonstrated protective effects in certain occasions. In conclusion, both NTB and CFB showed relatively similar hematological, hepatic and renal safety profile when used as adjuvant in RA patients, with few predominance for CFB in this regard"

Refobacin Palacos R) bone cement is no longer commercially available and was superseded by Refobacin bone cement R and Palacos R + G in 2005. However, the performance of these newly introduced bone cements have not been tested in a phased evidence-based manner, including roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA). Patients and Methods: in this blinded, randomised, clinical RSA study, the migration of the Stanmore femoral component was compared between Refobacin bone cement R and Palacos R + G in 62 consecutive total hip arthroplasties. The primary outcome measure was femoral component migration measured using RSA and secondary outcomes were Harris hip score (HHS), Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Results: femoral component migration was comparable between Refobacin bone cement R and Palacos R + G during the two-year follow-up period with an estimated mean difference of 0.06 mm of subsidence (p = 0.56) and 0.08degree of retroversion (p = 0.82). Five hips (three Refobacin bone cement R and two Palacos R + G) showed non-stabilising, continuous migration; the femoral cement mantle in these hips, was mean 0.7 mm thicker (p = 0.02) and there were more radiolucencies at the bone-cement interface (p = 0.004) in comparison to hips showing stabilising migration. Post-operative HHS was comparable throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.62). HOOS, EQ5D, and SF-36 scores were also comparable (p-values > 0.05) at the two-year follow-up point. Conclusion: refobacin bone cement R and Palacos R + G show comparable component migration and clinical outcome during the first two post-operative years. Hips showing continuous migration are at risk for early failure. However, this seems to be unrelated to cement type, but rather to cementing technique.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: thirty patients were randomised into three groups: cPP-ACP, CPP-ACFP, and 0.05 % NaF to be used two times a day during a 28-day experimental period. Saliva was analysed for flow rate, pH, buffering capacity and mineral concentrations. Dental plaque was examined for pH. Following the formation of artificial carious lesion, participants wore enamel slabs for an in situ remineralisation study. Remineralisation potential was examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) technique. SE microphotographs were subsequently analysed for area, diameter, perimeter, roundness and the number of enamel defects and percentage of tooth surface affected by defects.
RESULTS: at the end of the experimental period, a slight increase of salivary pH could have been observed. No differences in mineral composition of saliva were noted. The use of CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP contributed to a significant rise of plaque pH. Image analysis revealed excessive reduction of defects' dimensions in the three experimental groups, and a decrease of the number of enamel defects in the CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP groups. The EDS analysis did not show differences in Ca/P, Ca/O and P/O ratios in any of the treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: cPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP hold promise as remineralising agents for patients with SS.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: pastes containing CPP-ACP/CPP-ACFP show enhanced remineralisation potential compared with NaF mouthrinse in patients with SS."

Patients and Methods Between March 2009 and March 2011, 274 patients (310 hips) underwent cementless THA using a delta ceramic femoral head and liner. At each follow-up, clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to estimate survival. Results Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up. Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were audible. Radiolucent lines involving Gruen zones one and/or seven were seen in 52 hips (18.2%). No hip had detectable wear, focal osteolysis or signs of loosening. One hip was revised because of fracture of the ceramic liner, which occurred due to an undetected malseating of the ceramic liner at the time of surgery. One hip was revised for a periprosthetic fracture of the femur, and one hip was treated for periprosthetic joint infection. The six-year survivorship with re-operation for any reason as the endpoint was 99.0% (95% confidence interval 97.8% to 100%). Discussion The rate of delta ceramic fracture was 0.3% (one of 286). While ceramic head fracture was dominant in previous ceramic-on-ceramic THA, fracture of the delta ceramic liner due to malseating is a concern.

We tested the effect of a brief individualized counseling intervention on physical activity levels and fitness, and dietary intake, compared to standard of care. Methods: thirty patients with inflammatory arthritis (< 1 year duration) were randomized to standard of care or the intervention which consisted of individualized visits with a dietetic intern and physiotherapist at two time points to review age-specific strategies on diet and exercise. Primary outcomes included anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip circumference), nutritional intake, physical activity (pedometer steps) and physical fitness. Disease activity measures and biochemical testing (blood pressure measurement, inflammatory markers, cholesterol profile and random glucose) were collected. Change from baseline to six months in these outcomes were assessed using paired t-tests between groups. Results: thirteen patients in the intervention group and 10 in the control group completed the study. At baseline the two groups were well matched in demographics including age (49 years), gender (71% female standard care, 93% female intervention), seropositive (86%), mean BMI (27.2 kg/m2 standard care, 25.4 kg/m2 intervention) and functional disability as measured by the HAQ (mean 1.0 (SD 0.9), intervention 0.6 (SD0.4)). However, the standard of care group did have higher DAS28 scores than the intervention group at baseline (mean DAS28 5.5 (SD 1.4) standard care, mean DAS28 3.5 intervention p < 0.001). There were numerical trends to larger improvements in the intervention group for pedometer steps per week (intervention + 9,583, standard care +6,696) and the six-minute walk test distance (mean increase 45.7 meters intervention, mean increase 6.8 meters standard care), but these differences were not statistically significant. Biochemical markers including the LDL also improved to a greater degree in the intervention group but without reaching statistical significance (-0.23 (SD 1.53) intervention, mean change -0.09 (SD 1.11) standard care p = 0.8). There was no difference between the two groups in change in BMI. Nutritional intake (vitamin C, iron, fibre, vitamin A and folate) improved in the intervention group but did not reach statistical significance.

There is little information, however, on CAM use among adults with clinic-confirmed diagnoses, particularly rheumatic diseases that are treated by rheumatologists. Objective: to assess the frequency and types of CAM therapy used by Filipinos with chronic arthritic conditions including osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthropathies (SpA). Methods: a total of 83 participants were randomly selected from the clinic population of rheumatologists at 2 tertiary care centers-University of Santo Tomas Hospital and St. Luke's Medical Center. The patients were classified within strata defined by age, sex, and diagnostic group, educational background, occupation and average annual salary income. Personal interviews were conducted by appointment in partic-ipants' homes or in a clinic and during lay forums. Respondents completed an interviewer-administered survey including quality of life and visual analog pain scale written in English and Filipino. The selected CAM items were based on a review of the literature and feedback from members of Special Interest Groups of the Philippine Rheumatology Association. CAM items were included in the survey if they were locally used for arthritis. Participants were further asked to describe other therapies they were using for their arthritis Results: among the 83 patients included in the study 32 were diagnosed with RA (38. 6%), 40 with OA (48. 2%) and 11 with SpA (13. 3%). Sixty seven (80. 7%) were women and nearly half of them were housewives or unemployed (43. 4%). Majority of the group finished until high school (39. 8%) with 43.4% belonging to the group with an annual income between 30,000-70,000 pesos. Among the CAMs, a total of 66 (79. 5%) used vitamins and minerals, 54 (65. 1%) used topical medications, 50 (60. 2%) employed massage therapists/""hilot"", 40 (48. 2%) used nutriceuticals, 28 (33. 7%) used movement therapies and 16 (19. 3%) used diet. Only 12 (14. 5%) used herbal medicines, 10 (12%) used items worn, 10 (12%) used mind body therapies and 5 (6%) used energy therapies. Most of the patients had their disease diagnosed for more than five years before they tried using CAMs (61. 4%) and 66 (79. 5%) claimed to have improved pain scores and quality of life during the period that they are using CAM's. Seventy three (88%) used conventional treatments together with CAMs and nearly half (47%) of the total population visit their doctors each quarter of the year. Further evaluation of the kind of arthritis (OA vs. RA vs. SpA) there was no significant difference among the study population using nutriceuticals (p=0. 604), vitamin and minerals (p=0. 488), mind body therapies (p=0. 163), energy therapies (p=0. 428), diet (p=0. 588) and movement therapies (p=257); however it showed that more rheumatoid arthritis patients use herbal medicines (p=0. 053), topical medications (0. 019) and items worn (0. 014). Conclusion: filipino arthritis patients used CAM to supplement conventional treatments. Health care providers should be aware of the high use of CAM and incorporate questions about its use into routine assessments and treatment strategies"

We have followed 67 RA patients and 64 PsA patients for 1 year to evaluate the effects of TNF-alpha inhibitors on disease activity and on inflammatory anemia. Patients were divided into three different treatment groups, according to a randomized assignment to receive therapy with etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab. Treatment with anti-TNF-alpha resulted in a significant reduction in disease activity score-28 (DAS28) values both in RA and PsA patients, already from the third month of treatment (P = 0.01). In both populations, there was an increase in hemoglobin (HB) levels already after 3 months of treatment (P = 0.001), and HB levels were inversely proportional to the disease activity, regardless of the type of medication used. The increased HB values and the reduction of DAS28 values during the observation period suggest the existence of a negative correlation between them both in RA and PsA, regardless of the type of anti-TNF-alpha used. Our data suggest a pleiotropic action of anti-TNF-alpha, such as the well-known action on the activity of the disease, and the improvement in inflammatory anemia.

Reduction of SB and increase in light intensity physical activity has been suggested as a means of improvement of health in patients with mobility problems. Short-term intervention studies have demonstrated that SB can be reduced by behavioural interventions in sedentary populations. To evaluate descriptively the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation, outcome assessments, retention and the acceptability of an individually tailored, theory-based behavioural intervention targeting reduction in daily sitting time in patients with RA.
METHODS: a randomised, controlled trial with two parallel groups. RA patients >18¬†years of age and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score‚Äâ‚Äâ4¬†h. The 16-week intervention included 1) three individual motivational counselling sessions and 2) individual text message reminders aimed at reducing daily sitting time. The control group was encouraged to maintain their usual lifestyles. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the 16¬†week intervention. Daily sitting time was measured using an ActivPAL3(TM) activity monitor. The study was not powered to show superiority; rather the objective was to focus on acceptability among patients and clinical health professionals.
RESULTS: in total, 107 patients were invited and screened before 20 met eligibility criteria and consented; reasons for declining study participation were mostly flares, lack of time and co-morbidities. One patient from the control group dropped out before end of intervention (due to a RA flare). Intervention participants completed all counselling sessions. All procedures regarding implementation of the trial protocol were feasible. The daily sitting time was reduced on average by 0.30¬†h in the intervention group unlike the control group that tended to increase it by 0.15¬†h after 16¬†weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: this study shows that an individually tailored behavioural intervention targeting reduction of SB was feasible and acceptable to patients with RA.

Material and Methods: Men (n=60, > 80 y) in a long-term care facility received a supplement of 2000 IU/d of vitamin D for 8 weeks followed by a trial using 0 IU/d (placebo), 500 IU/d or 1000 IU/d of vitamin D administered in foods (e. g., pudding) for 6 months (NCT01437696). Exclusion criteria: Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score <18, end-stage renal disease, and hyperparathyroidism. At baseline and 6 mo, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured using a chemiluminescent assay (Liaison, Diasorin Inc. USA). Age, body mass index (BMI), medications and MMSE values were obtained from chart review. Rheumatoid arthritis was assessed using a disease activity score based on 28 joints and erythro-cyte sedimentation rate (DAS28); hydroxychloroquine was prescribed to n=1 and acetaminophen to n=34. Grip strength of the non-dominant forearm was assessed using a dynamometer (Jamar, Patterson Medical, USA). Forearm soft tissue composition was assessed at the 66% site using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (XCT2000, Stratec, Germany). Differences among groups over time were tested using mixed model ANOVAwith least square means post-hoc testing. Relationships were tested using Pearson correlation analyses. Results: At baseline, average (+/-SE) age 89.9+/-0. 4 y, BMI 26.3 +/-0. 6 kg/m2, DAS28 3.3+/-0. 1, serum 25(OH)D 68.2+/-1. 6 nmol/L, and grip strength (18. 3+/-0. 7 kg) were not different among groups. Serum 25(OH)D declined in the placebo group and increased in the 500 and 1000 IU groups (difference+/-SE placebo:-13. 9+/-2. 6; 500 IU: 9.7+/-4. 5; 1000 IU: 9.7+/-2. 7 nmol/L, p<0. 05). Grip strength was maintained only in the 1000 IU group (placebo:-1. 3+/-0. 5; 500 IU:-1. 8+/-0. 5; 1000 IU: 0.3+/-0. 6 kg, p<0. 05). Forearm muscle area (3138. 6+/-70. 4 mm2), density (68. 3+/-0. 7 mg/cm3), fat area (1108. 9+/-66. 3 mm2) and the ratio of fat:muscle area (36. 0+/-2. 3) did not differ among groups. Only muscle area declined over time (-111. 3 +/-29. 1 mm2 p=0. 0002), and was associated with grip strength (endpoint r=0. 31, p=0. 026). Conclusion: A dosage of 1000 IU/d of vitamin D in advanced aging appears beneficial to muscle function based on grip strength. Whether this aids in prevention of falls needs further study."

Methods: one hundred fifty nine patients received one bolus of IV-TXA before skin incision and two boluses three and six hours later (group A), or another bolus nine hours later (group B), or another two boluses nine and 12 hours later (group C). The primary outcomes were total blood loss (TBL), hidden blood loss (HBL), and maximum haemoglobin (Hb) drop. Other outcome measurements such as fibrinolysis parameters [fibrin(-ogen) degradation products (FDP), D-dimer], inflammatory factors [interleukin-6 (IL-6)], transfusion rate, range of motion (ROM), length of hospital stay (LOH), and complications were also recorded and compared. Results: the mean TBL, HBL and maximum Hb drop in group C (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.025) and group B (p = 0.025, p = 0.025, p = 0.044) were lower than those in group A. FDP and D-Dimer in group C was lower than in group A and B on post-operative day one. IL-6 in group A, B and C showed a downward tendency on post-operative days one and three (POD1 and POD3). Moreover, the ROM and LOH were better in group C. No episodes of transfusion or deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were detected in all groups. Conclusions: the 5-dose TXA regimen can further reduce the blood loss, diminish the maximum Hb drop, minimize inflammation, enhance mobility, and shorten LOS following TKA, without increasing the risk of complications. An additional dose could be requisite when fibrinolysis maintains after 5-dose regimen has already been performed. Level of evidence: i. Copyright ¬© 2017, SICOT aisbl"

A clinical trial is needed in the future to ascertain the most effective routes and doses of CS in JIA. Objectives: to explore families' experiences of four CS delivery routes in JIA and to assess their views regarding feasibility of a future trial evaluating the most effective routes and doses of CS. Methods: semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of young people and their parents (N = 28; 9 young people and 19 par-ents), recruited from four UK Paediatric Rheumatology providers. Data were analysed using thematic analysis informed by the Framework Approach. Results: families had first-hand experience of oral prednisolone (n= 10), intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (n = 7), intra-articular (IA) injections (n = 14) and intra-muscular (IM) injections (n = 3). The majority of families (n = 13/15) had experience of at least two delivery routes. Par-ents and young people tended to view oral prednisolone as less suit-able for more advanced JIA and IA was viewed as less appropriate for patients with poly or systemic arthritis. Young people were more likely than their parents to report willingness to participate in a trial of CS. Overall, participants tended to be more willing to participate at time of diagnosis than at time of JIA flare; previous positive and negative experiences of delivery routes influenced perceptions of future treatment efficacy. Key barriers to participation identified by both parents and young people included: the perception that some delivery routes would be more or less appropriate due to factors such as age and JIA sub-type; being randomly allocated to receive a treatment, rather than the treatment being clinician-informed; concerns regarding the quality of care they would receive as a trial participant. Conclusion: recruitment of children and young people with flaring JIA to a future trial will likely be more challenging than recruitment at diag-nosis. The findings can be used to inform the design of a future trial of CS. In order to optimise the recruitment process for a future trial, clinicians will need to provide families with comprehensive information on treatment arms, the rationale for randomisation (including emphasising equipoise), and reassurance of quality of care whether they participate or not. Doing so would reduce families' anxieties, improve informed consent and potentially optimise recruitment. Researching families' perspectives about future paediatric rheumatology trials can help to assess the feasibility of these trials and optimise their design"

The new drug treatment requires intensive education and following. In healthcare there are many ways to promote adherence. Studies also suggest that frequent contacts between the patient and the clinic also enhance the adherence but resources are often limited. There is obvious need to improve communication between the patient and the clinic. Objectives: to study the validity and feasibility of the SandRA. A Finnish work group has recentely developed a treatment monitoring software called SandRA (Showing any need for Re-Assessment). It is based on automated cell phone text messages and has proved to be a valid and useful tool among the adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. Methods: patients visiting the rheumatologic outpatient clinic of Helsinki Children's Hospital were asked to participate the study at the time when new medication was introduced. 21 JIA patients volun-teered to this pilot study with 20 methotrexate and 1 etanercept in-ceptions. Patients fulfilled the criteria of the International League of Association for Rheumatology (ILAR) for JIA. 10 (48%) had oligoarthritis, 9 (43%) polyarthritis, one rheumatoid factor positive disease and one psoriarthritis. None had uveitis. The SandRA-system automatically sends text messages (questions) to the patient's/parent's cell phone every two weeks for six months. The questions concern medication, possible side-effects and laboratory results. The follow-up parameters we collected at routine visits (0, 3 and 6 months). The outcome was evalueted with clinical criteria of remission, JADAS-10 and CHAQ. Results: of the 21 patients 15 were female (76%). Mean age was 8,6 years (SD 4,2 years). One patient was ANAab positive and one rheumatoid factor and ACPA positive. HLAB27 positivity was found in 7 patient (37%). 95% of parents found SandRA-system easy to use. 3 parents (14%) wished more direct contacts with the clinic. 12 (57%) considered SandRAas a useful additional tool and 76% were interested to use it in the future. At 6 months after drug treatment initiation, 11 (52%) patients were in clinical remission. JADAS-10 was 8,2 and 3,1 in the baseline and in the 6 months visit, respectively (P < 0,001) (Table 21). Conclusion: sandRA was considered as a promising tool in enhancing the adherence to treatment and thus, achieving remission in JIA among families and health care workers. Next, we plan to introduce a 6-12 months randomized controlled study. Presumably some modi-fications will be made in the system, for example timing of the questions needs adjustment. Other digital methods than text messages might also improve participation of teenagers"
9262313,,10.3899/jrheum.151421,"OBJECTIVE: to assess the use of electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROM) in standard clinical practice for early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management, the ePROM ability to enhance clinical care, and how computing technology can improve the patients' adherence to therapy.
METHODS: in a double-blinded randomized-controlled study, 211 patients with early RA diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria completed a PROM in paper format at their first clinic visit. Patients were then randomized to Group 1, which completed an ePROM questionnaire monthly, or Group 2, which continued the standard paper PROM format. Over a 12-month period, Group 1 patients were assessed every 3 months in the clinic, whereas Group 2 patients were assessed in the clinic initially monthly for 6 months, then every 3 months. The primary endpoint was the equivalence of outcomes [Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID-3) and 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)] in both groups. The secondary endpoint was the patients' adherence to their medications.
RESULTS: there was no significant difference between disease activity measures as well as DAS28 and RAPID-3 scores at 3, 6, and 12 months of management, although there was a trend toward lower patient-reported tender joint count and functional disability score in the active group versus the control group. The patients' adherence to antirheumatic therapy was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the ePROM group, whereas stopping disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for intolerability was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the control group at 12 months of treatment.
CONCLUSION: we found ePROM equivalent to standard paper PROM format. Further, it enabled the patients to personally monitor how they are doing regarding their disease activity and helped to optimize their adherence to their treatment."

However, many RA patients complain about problems to receive prescriptions or have a lack of access to physiotherapy. Recent reports have shown positive effects of the Wii game console on physical and psychosocial conditions of patients with other underlying diseases. The primary objectives of this prospective controlled pilot study were to investigate feasibility and patients' assessment using an animated home-based exercise program.
METHOD: this pilot study was conducted as a single-center, cross-over trial with two treatment arms over 24¬†weeks. Eligibility criteria included patients with RA reaching low disease activity under therapy with a biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD). After detailed instruction, 15 patients started with a conventional home-based physical exercise program and 15 patients began with a predefined animated exercise program by using the Wii game console for 12¬†weeks. Afterwards, patients were crossed-over to the other treatment arm for another period of 12¬†weeks. Multi-methodical assessments were performed by qualitative analysis of the interview-data as well as statistical analysis of functional tests and patient reported outcomes (PRO's).
RESULTS: evaluation of the interviews indicated feasibility and usefulness of the chosen animated home-based exercise program. Forefoot disabilities were identified as a main limiting factor for performing some of the animated exercises. After 12¬†weeks, both treatment arms showed improvement of functional tests without significant differences between groups: overall muscle strength improved for a mean value of 10 Newton (+12¬†%) and the mean 6-min walk test (6-MWT) distance increased for 28 meters (+5¬†%).
CONCLUSION: this study showed that an animated home-based exercise program by using a Wii game console was feasible and beneficial for RA patients. Compared to standard physical home exercises, similar effects were observed indicating that such an animated program might be an alternative supportive option for RA patients.

Etoricoxib is a COX-2 selective NSAID that has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of RA at a dose of 90 mg. The current study further evaluated the efficacy of etoricoxib 60 mg and 90 mg in RA patients with active disease.
METHODS: this was a 2-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in RA (NCT01208181). Patients were required to have a diagnosis of RA (according to ARA 1987 revised classification criteria) and were to demonstrate symptom flare upon discontinuation of previous NSAID treatment prior to randomization. Part I was a 6-week, placebo-controlled period to assess the efficacy of etoricoxib 90 mg and etoricoxib 60 mg, each compared to placebo, as well as to each other. Part II was a 6-week period to evaluate the potential benefit of dose escalation from etoricoxib 60 mg to etoricoxib 90 mg after 6 weeks exposure to etoricoxib 60 mg in Part I compared to maintaining a steady dose of etoricoxib 60 mg throughout Parts I and II. Primary endpoints were Disease Activity Score evaluating 28 joints and C reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) index and Patient Global Assessment of Pain (Pain) score (0-100 mm VAS) after 6 weeks of treatment in Part I.

If we could elucidate the tendencies of the placebo response and find predictors, we could reduce the placebo response in clinical trials for dry eye. In this study, we investigated the predictive factors for the placebo effect in dry eye clinical trials. Methods A total of 205 patients with dry eye assigned to the placebo arms of three placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials were analysed by simple and multivariable regression analysis. The corneal fluorescein (FL) staining score and dry eye symptoms were studied at week 4. The variables of interest included gender, age, complications of Sjogren's syndrome, Schirmer's test I value, tear break-up time and conjunctival hyperaemia score. We also conducted a stratified analysis according to the patients' age. Results Among all the studied endpoints, the baseline scores were significantly related to the corresponding placebo response. In addition, for the FL score and the dryness score, age was a significant predictor of the placebo response (p=0.04 and p<0.0001, respectively). Stratified analysis by age showed that patients more than 40 years of age are more likely to have a stronger placebo response in the FL and dryness scores. Conclusion The baseline scores and age were predictive factors of the placebo response in frequently used endpoints, such as FL score or dryness symptoms. These patient characteristics can be controlled by study design, and our findings enable the design of more efficient placebo-controlled studies with good statistical power.

METHODS: sixty wind-cold-damp retention type RA patients were randomly allocated to HRN group (n=30) and control group (n=30). Guanyuan (CV 4), Qihai (CV 6), bilateral Zusanli (ST 36), and local acupoints near the knee-joint were selected for needling stimulation. Patients of the HRN group were treated by manipulating the acupuncture needle with HRN, and those of the control group treated by manipulating the needle with uniform reinforcing-reducing method. The treatments were performed once daily, 5 days a week, and two weeks altogether. The other 30 healthy volunteers were recruited as the normal control group. The TCM symptom scoring system (0-31 points, 11 items as the severities of pain, swelling and tenderness of the knee-joint) was used to evaluate the status of RA, and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of plasma Atp 5 O mRNA and Atp 6 V 1 B 2 mRNA following removal of red blood cells.
RESULTS: after the treatment, the TCM scores of both the HRN and control groups were significantly decreased (P<0.05), and that of the HRN group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). Before the treatment, the expression levels of plasma Atp 5 O mRNA and Atp 6 V 1 B 2 mRNA in RA patients were significantly lower than those of the normal group (P<0.05), and after the treatment, the expression levels of plasma Atp 5 O mRNA and Atp 6 V 1 B 2 mRNA were significantly increased in both HRN and control groups compared to pre-treatment in the same one group (P<0.05), and the up-regulated Atp 5 O mRNA and Atp 6 V 1 B 2 mRNA levels were remarkably higher in the control group than in the HRN group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: both heat-producing needling and uniform reinforcing-reducing needling can improve RA patients' clinical symptoms, which may be associated with their actions in up-regulating expressions of plasma Atp 5 O mRNA and Atp 6 V 1 B 2 mRNA."

METHODS: two multicenter, open-label sub-studies enrolled patients from the ACQUIRE (pneumococcal and influenza) and ATTUNE (pneumococcal) studies at any point during their SC abatacept treatment cycle following completion of ‚â•3¬†months' SC abatacept. All patients received fixed-dose abatacept 125¬†mg/week with background DMARDs. A pre-vaccination blood sample was taken, and after 28‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3¬†days a final post-vaccination sample was collected. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an immunologic response to the vaccine at Day 28 among patients without a protective antibody level to the vaccine antigens at baseline (pneumococcal: defined as ‚â•2-fold increase in post-vaccination titers to ‚â•3 of 5 antigens and protective antibody level of ‚â•1.6¬†Œºg/mL to ‚â•3 of 5 antigens; influenza: defined as ‚â•4-fold increase in post-vaccination titers to ‚â•2 of 3 antigens and protective antibody level of ‚â•1: 40 to ‚â•2 of 3 antigens).

RESULTS: pre- and post-vaccination titers were available for 113/125 and 186/191 enrolled patients receiving the PPSV23 and influenza vaccine, respectively. Among vaccinated patients, 47/113 pneumococcal and 121/186 influenza patients were without protective antibody levels at baseline. Among patients with available data, 73.9¬†% (34/46) and 61.3¬†% (73/119) met the primary endpoint and achieved an immunologic response to PPSV23 or influenza vaccine, respectively.

Repeat biopsies should be strongly considered when unconfirmed lymphoma remains in the differential diagnosis. Case information: a 19 year old previously healthy male presented in October 2012 with flu-like symptoms and joint pains in his hands. Evaluation revealed leukocytosis, a mediastinal mass, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy showed reactive changes. He was diagnosed with adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) in December 2012 and treated with high dose steroids and serial immunomodulators through July 2013. His symptoms waxed and waned but never fully resolved. Transthoracic mediastinal mass biopsy in September 2013 showed fibrous tissue with atypical lymphoid infiltrate, but definitive diagnosis of lymphoma was not possible given inadequate sampling/ crush artifact. He presented to our medical center in November 2013. Video assisted thorascopic surgical biopsy yielded adequate tissue with well preserved architecture. A diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) was made based on microscopic appearance and immunohistochemistry. He consented to participation in a randomized trial of doxorubicin/bleomycin/vinblastine/dacarbazine (ABVD; Arm A) versus doxorubicin/vinblastine/dacarbazine plus brentuximab vedotin (AVD plus BV; Arm B). He was randomized to Arm B, completed six cycles, and achieved rapid symptom resolution. Discussion: this case represents a delayed diagnosis of cHL from misdiagnosed AOSD. Malignancy can manifest with rheumatologic features such as arthropathy, skin rash, and elevated inflammatory markers. Lymphoma can overlap with rheumatologic disorders. In retrospect, the presence of a large mediastinal mass, along with the poor response to AOSD-directed therapies, suggested a different underlying process. Importantly, this case highlights the problem of inadequate tissue sampling. Non-definitive diagnoses with fine needle aspiration can occur. Open biopsy may also be nondiagnostic from inadequate sampling and/or crush artifact, which can distort cells. Given inadequate sampling, repeat open sampling may significantly increase diagnostic yield. Clinicians should consider frequent re-evaluation of underlying pathology in cases where response is suboptimal (Figure presented)"

The physical dysfunction symptomatic of RA means people living with this disease spend large periods of the day sedentary, which may further elevate their risk of CVD. The primary aim of this study was to investigate relationships between objectively assessed sedentary behaviour patterns and light physical activity (LPA) with 10-year risk of CVD. Secondary aims were to explore the role of sedentary behaviour patterns and LPA for individual CVD risk factors and functional disability in RA. The extent to which associations were independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) engagement was also examined.
METHODS: baseline data from a subsample of participants recruited to the Physical Activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis (PARA) study were used to answer current research questions. Sixty-one patients with RA (mean age (¬± SD) = 54.92‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ12.39 years) provided a fasted blood sample and underwent physical assessments to evaluate factors associated with their cardiovascular health. Sedentary behaviour patterns (sedentary time, sedentary¬†bouts, sedentary breaks), LPA and MVPA were measured via 7-days of accelerometry. Ten-year CVD risk was computed (Q-risk-score2), and functional disability determined via questionnaire.
RESULTS: regressions revealed significant positive associations between sedentary time and the number of sedentary bouts per day ‚â•20¬†min with 10-year CVD risk, with the reverse true for LPA participation. Associations were independent of MVPA engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: promoting LPA participation and restricting sedentary bouts to¬†<20¬†min may attenuate long-term CVD risk in RA, independent of MVPA engagement.

Topical fluoride is commonly prescribed for caries prevention. METHODS: in this 24-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, SS patients were randomly assigned to receive either fluoride varnish or placebo gel quarterly. Development and arrest of caries at the coronal and root surfaces were recorded at 12-month and 24-month and compared to that of the baseline. Effect of fluoride varnish on oral Candida and lactobacilli colonization was explored by comparing baseline oral microbiological assessments to data obtained at 12-month and 24-month. RESULTS: seventy-eight SS patients (mean age=50 years, 2 men) completed this trial. At 24-month, the mean new coronal enamel caries were 1.6 surfaces in both groups, and new dentin caries were 1.4 and 2.7 surfaces in the fluoride and placebo group respectively (p>0.05). Mean arrested caries were 0.6 and 0.7 surfaces for fluoride and placebo groups respectively and that of root caries were 0.3 and 0.1 surfaces (p>0.05). The mean oral Candida count was reduced by 30 % in the fluoride group but increased 61 % in the placebo group while no change in oral lactobacilli counts in both groups at 24 months (p>0.05). SS patients receiving fluoride varnish were significantly less likely to develop dentin caries (p<0.05). In contrast, those with high baseline DMFS scores (p=0.05), harbored mixed Candida species (p<0.05), or unstimulated whole saliva at low pH (p<0.01) were significantly more likely to develop dentin caries. CONCLUSIONS: results of this randomized clinical trial did not provide clear evidence to support or refute that quarterly applications of fluoride varnish can prevent development of dental caries in people with Sjogren's syndrome.

Hepcidin production is induced by regulatory cytokines, IL-6 and inflammation. In our study; we aimed to assess the effect of anti-TNF therapy on prohepcidin level in patients with RA. MATERIALS-METHODS: 59 patients, aged 18-75, diagnosed as RA according to 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria and 64 healthy volunteers who were appropriate in terms of age and gender were included in the study. Patients were divided into anti-TNF and DMARD groups according to the drugs they used. Prohepsidin, Hgb, Fe, Ferritin and Transferrin levels were measured in all groups. RESULTS: hgb (p =0.026) and iron (p = 0.001) levels in the control group were significantly higher than in the anti-TNF and DMARD groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in ferritin and transferrin levels. According to DMARD (594.2 pg/ml) and control group (534.4 pg/ml), prohepcidin level was lower in anti-TNF group (491.04 pg/ml) but there was no statistically significant difference (p> 0.05 ). There was no statistically significant difference in prohepcidin levels between patient [(anti-TNF + DMARD) (569,1 pg/ml)] and control groups (534.4 pg/ml) (p> 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: in our study, we found low prohepsidin levels in the anti-TNF group but the lack of cytokine data was a major limitation of our study. To contribute to the effectiveness of our work, it is required to have longer-term and comprehensive studies evaluating RA patients who are early period and have had no medical treatment"

Out of the 470 sera collected, 409 were from residents of an onchocerciasis hyper-endemic area, 55 non-endemic and 6 European normal sera served as control. The patients' age, sex, skin microfilaria densities, dermal and ocular clinical manifestations (colour of optic disc) have been well characterised. The study population had participated in a placebocontrolled (n=191) trial of ivermectin (Mectizan) treatment (n=218). The parasite antigens are phosphate buffered saline crude extract of adult worms of Onchocerca volvulus, a recombinant antigen (Ov1.9) and a monoclonal antibody purified antigen (Cam 1). The non-parasite antigens are deoxycholate citrate extract of optic nerve (nerve-DOC) and commercially available IgA, IgM and IgG were used to assay for rheumatoid factor (Rh-F) auto-antibodies. Generally, antibodies to parasite antigens in onchocerciasis patients were remarkably higher than control group (p<0.05) using exact F-test. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in antibodies to nerve-DOC and Rh-F in patients compared to control. Antibodies increased with increasing skin snip microfilaria load from 0.69+/-0.28 with 0mf/mg (n=54) as against 0.80+/-0.26 for those with 4-20mf/mg. Observed slight negative correlation in IgG antibody levels and severity of disc colour with mean OD values of 0.26+/-0.22 in those graded as having no optic nerve disease (OND) (disc 1, n=86) and 0.17+/-0.19 for those with severe changes (disc 3, n=49) was not statistically significant (P>0.05). An age dependent significant decrease (P<0.05) in antibodies were observed with 0.64+/-0.34 for 15-30yr old (n=48) compared to 0.48+/-0.35 for those 50yr (n=50) for PBS with a similar trend for IgG to Ov1.9 and Cam1. In conclusion, serum parasite-specific and non-parasite antibodies may not be responsible for the pathology of optic nerve disease. Onchocerciasis patients were apparently not at higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis than the control."

To investigate its effectiveness, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted. In addition, the content of the chat and participants' goals were studied to identify underlying processes.
METHODS: an RCT with a six-month follow up period was conducted among 72 young adults with JIA, aged between 16 and 25¬†years old, randomly assigned to the intervention or to the usual care control group. After 24¬†weeks, in both groups 24 participants completed all measurements. Intentions to treat analyses were carried out by means of linear mixed models for longitudinal measurements. With self-efficacy as primary outcome, self-management, disease activity, quality of life, absenteeism of school/work, health care medication use and adherence to the intervention were studied. The participants' goals, personal achievements, interactions on the chat, and their appreciation of the intervention were analyzed using thematic analyses.
RESULTS: no significant differences were found on self-efficacy, quality of life, and self-management between the participants of the control group and the intervention group. In the intervention group, modeling and sharing experiences were the most recognized themes. Fifty-five goals were formulated and divided into the following categories: improvement and maintaining balance, setting and recognizing boundaries, communicating and coping with incomprehension. Adherence, appreciation of the own learning experience, and personal achievements were rated positively.
CONCLUSION: the web-based intervention did not lead to an improvement of self-efficacy. However, additional qualitative analyses showed that the intervention was appreciated and valuable for the participants. More research is needed on how to measure the added value of this intervention compared to the usual care.

Data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis revealed that dose tapering combined with tight control of disease activity is successful. For psoriasis patients the lowest effective dose of biologics needs to be determined. The objective was to assess whether dose tapering of biologics guided by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) scores in psoriasis patients with controlled disease activity is non-inferior (NI) to usual care.
METHODS/DESIGN: this is a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized, non-inferiority trial with cost- effectiveness analysis. One hundred and twenty patients with stable low disease activity (PASI‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ5 and DLQI‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ5) for at least 6¬†months with a stable use of adalimumab, etanercept or ustekinumab will be randomized 1: 1 to the dose reduction group or usual care. In the dose reduction group, the treatment intervals will be prolonged stepwise, resulting in a 33% and 50% dose reduction, respectively. Disease activity is monitored every three months with PASI and DLQI. In case of flare the treatment is adjusted to the previous effective dose. The primary outcome (PASI) at 12¬†months will be analyzed with ANCOVA in which the baseline PASI will be included as covariate to gain efficiency. The secondary outcomes include number of and time to disease flares, health-related quality of life, serious adverse events, and costs.
DISCUSSION: with this study we want to assess whether disease activity guided dose reduction of biologics can be achieved for psoriasis patients with low stable disease activity, without losing disease control. By using the lowest effective dose of biologics, we expect to minimize side effects and save costs.

Method: the study was a 12-week randomized, controlled, phase I/II clinical trial with two treatment arms: m2000 and conventional treatment. Patients who had RA according to the modified American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, with active disease at baseline also inadequate response to conventional therapy, were enrolled in this study. M2000 was administrated at a dose of two capsules (500 mg) per day orally during a period of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients fulfilling the ACR 20% improvement criteria after 12 weeks of M2000 therapy. Moreover, the patients were also followed up for safety. Results: there were no statistically significant differences between treatment and conventional groups at baseline characteristics. The ACR20 response rate was significantly higher among M2000-treated patients than conventional-treated control, so that 74% of patients in treatment group showed an ACR20 response after 12 weeks of M2000 therapy (74 versus 16%; P = 0.011). 10% of M2000-treated patients and 57.1% of conventional-treated patient's adverse events occurred during this study. Conclusion: treatment with M2000 in combination with conventional therapy showed a significantly superior efficacy along with a high safety profile compared to conventional-treated patients. Thereby, M2000 might be suggested as a suitable option in the treatment of RA. Copyright ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature"

This paper describes a protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial of an aerobic exercise intervention compared with exercise advice designed to improve sleep in people with RA. Objectives are to obtain reliable estimates regarding recruitment rates, participant retention and protocol adherence and to generate potential effect size estimates for a main trial. Participants will be identified from an existing database held at a University Hospital and in person at weekly rheumatology clinics. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised into an intervention or control group. Those in the intervention group will participate in an 8-week walking-based exercise intervention consisting of 28 walking sessions, with 1 session per week being supervised by a trained physiotherapist, spread over a maximum of 8 weeks (2-5 times/week), while those in the control group will receive advice on the benefits of exercise for people with RA. Results will provide data for efficient recruitment and data collection, to determine if a larger, statistically powered main trial could be generalised to a multi-centre rheumatoid arthritis population. Given recent information that sleep is commonly reduced in people with RA and that physical activity and exercise profiles are lower, this study will contribute data to the field of exercise and sleep that is currently lacking and importantly will include people with RA in the study process prior to any fully powered trial.

Methods: in this network meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in patients with active RA were included. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to combine the direct and indirect evidence from the RCTs. Results: seven RCTs involving 3461 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were ten pairwise comparisons, including seven direct comparisons and five interventions. The ACR20 response rate was significantly higher in the baricitinib 4 mg in combination with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) group than in the placebo+DMARD group (odds ratio, OR 3.13; 95% credible interval, CrI 2.32-4.33). Compared with the placebo+DMARD group, the baricitinib 4 mg, baricitinib 2 mg + DMARD, and adalimumab 40 mg + methotrexate (MTX) groups showed a significantly higher ACR20 response rate. The ranking probability based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated that baricitinib 4 mg + DMARD was likely to elicit the best ACR20 response rate (SUCRA = 0.7930), followed by baricitinib 4 mg (SUCRA = 0.7034), baricitinib 2 mg + DMARD (SUCRA = 0.6304), adalimumab 40 mg + MTX (SUCRA = 0.3687), and placebo+DMARD (SUCRA = 0.0045). By contrast, the safety based on the number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) did not differ significantly among the five interventions.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent which demonstrated analgesic effects in some studies. This study is designed to assess the effects of oral NAC as an adjuvant therapy on the clinical outcomes of patients with active RA. Methods: in this randomized clinical trial, 51 RA patients with active RA were studied in 2 groups: NAC group (27 patients) received standard treatment of RA and 600 mg NAC twice a day for 12 weeks, and placebo group (24 patients) received the standard treatment of RA and placebo. Disease activity score (DAS28) was used to assess the activity of RA, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for the severity of pain, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) for the patients' physical performance, and Global Health (GH) parameter for the patients' assessment of their disease activity. The number of tender and swollen joints and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were also determined for each patient. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). Results: after 12 weeks of intervention, there were no significant differences between two groups in DAS28 score and ESR (P values were 0.4 and 0.6, respectively). However, GH, VAS, and HAQ scores were improved significantly in the NAC group compared to the placebo group. Conclusion: our findings indicate that oral administration of NAC may be associated with improving health status in RA patients and considered as an adjuvant therapy in these patients. Further studies with larger sample size, longer study duration and higher doses of NAC are needed to confirm the effects of oral NAC in RA patients. Copyright ¬© 2018 Bentham Science Publishers"

A 2-compartment model with a combination of linear clearance (0.419 L/day) and nonlinear clearance (relevant only at low doses; Vmax and Km of 0.155 mg/day and 0.0458 mg/L, respectively) described ABT-122 pharmacokinetics. Subcutaneous bioavailability was 35%-58% across formulations and populations. Body weight was a significant covariate for ABT-122 clearance, with subjects with body weight of 140 and 40 kg estimated to have 38% lower and 43% higher ABT-122 AUC, respectively, compared with a 70-kg reference subject. ABT-122 antidrug antibody (ADA) titer (ADA incidence, 47%; 0 to 519 000 titer range in the data set) was a continuous covariate on ABT-122 clearance. An ADA titer of 100 units resulted in a 5-fold increase in clearance. Sex, age, and baseline serum albumin or baseline C-reactive protein level did not impact ABT-122 exposure. Fixed-effects and random-effects parameters were estimated with a relative standard error of <=17% and <=28%, respectively, and the model was qualified using bootstrap analysis and visual predictive checks.

9262617,,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018540,"INTRODUCTION: patients with systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) above the baseline risk attributable to traditional CVD risk factors seen in the general population. Exercise in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is designed specifically for high-risk primary prevention and those with established CVD. Even though the European League Against Rheumatism guidelines state that exercise is safe for individuals with RA and exercise can reduce CVD risk, patients with RA rarely participate in CR. Thus, little is known about CR's impact on inflammatory and CVD risk in the RA population. The purpose of this trial is to determine the feasibility of a 12-week CR programme for patients with RA and whether it decreases CVD risk without exacerbating RA.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: this is a randomised controlled trial whereby 60 participants with RA will be recruited and randomly assigned to either standard of care (SOC) treatment or SOC plus a 12-week CR programme (60‚Äâmin of education plus two 60‚Äâmin aerobic exercise sessions/week). Exercise will be performed at 60%-80% of heart rate reserve. Outcome measures (Framingham Risk Score, resting heart rate, blood pressure, blood lipids, markers of systemic inflammation (ie, interleukin (IL) 6 and tumour necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), Clinical Disease Assessment Index, Disease Activity Score-28, physical activity levels and peak cardiorespiratory fitness) will be assessed preintervention (week-0), postintervention (week-13) and 6‚Äâmonths postintervention.

'Treating to target' has been shown to be effective in active established disease and also in early disease. However, there is a lack of nationally agreed treatment protocols for patients with established rheumatoid arthritis who have intermediate disease activity. This trial is designed to investigate whether intensive management of disease leads to a greater number of remissions at 12¬†months. Levels of disability and quality of life, and acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be examined.
METHODS: the trial is a 12-month, pragmatic, randomised, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre trial undertaken at specialist rheumatology centres across England. Three hundred and ninety-eight patients with established rheumatoid arthritis will be recruited. They will currently have intermediate disease activity (disease activity score for 28 joints assessed using an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 3.2 to 5.1 with at least three active joints) and will be taking at least one disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. Participants will be randomly selected to receive intensive management or standard care. Intensive management will involve monthly clinical reviews with a specialist health practitioner, where drug treatment will be optimised and an individualised treatment support programme delivered based on several principles of motivational interviewing to address identified problem areas, such as pain, fatigue and adherence. Standard care will follow standard local pathways and will be in line with current English guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Patients will be assessed initially and at 6 and 12¬†months through self-completed questionnaires and clinical evaluation.
DISCUSSION: the trial will establish whether the known benefits of intensive treatment strategies in active rheumatoid arthritis are also seen in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis who have moderately active disease. It will evaluate both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment.

The safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BI 655064, a novel humanised antagonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody, were investigated in this first-in-human trial.
METHODS: healthy male subjects (n¬†=¬†72) were randomised 3: 1, within each BI 655064 dose group, to single intravenous (IV; 0.2-120¬†mg) or subcutaneous (SC; 40-120¬†mg) doses of BI 655064 or placebo. Safety, plasma exposure, CD40 receptor occupancy and CD40L-induced CD54 upregulation were assessed over 12¬†weeks.
RESULTS: adverse events (AEs) were reported in 43% of subjects (n¬†=¬†31). Frequency and intensity of AEs were generally similar between BI 655064 and placebo and showed no dose relationship. The most frequent AEs were headache and nasopharyngitis. One mild rash and one local reaction occurred with SC BI 655064; two serious AEs were reported, both judged unrelated to BI 655064. Pharmacokinetic evaluation demonstrated a more than proportional increase in plasma exposure relative to BI 655064 dose, with a terminal half-life between 4¬†h and 4¬†days IV and approximately 5¬†days SC; doses ‚â•¬†20¬†mg IV and 120¬†mg SC showed >¬†90% CD40 receptor occupancy and inhibition of CD54 upregulation, which lasted 7¬†days in the 120¬†mg IV and SC groups.
CONCLUSIONS: single doses up to 120¬†mg BI 655064 IV and SC were well tolerated and showed a high potential to block the CD40-CD40L pathway, supporting further clinical development of BI 655064 in patients with autoimmune disease.

Results: A total of 425 participants were enrolled. There were 85 (20%) and 340 (80%) in the control and study group, respectively. The demographics and clinical characteristics revealed comparable between the groups. Compared to control group patients, patients on LDG had significant lower vertebral BMD (L 1-4) (g/cm2), (0.854(0.200) vs. 0.896 (0.201), p=0.046), higher rate of previous fracture (103 (30.3) vs. 13 (15.3), p=0.006), substantially higher 10-year probability of major (14 (15.5) vs. 8 (8.6), p<0.0001) and hip (4.4 (8.4) vs. 2 (3.9), p<0.0001) fracture, respectively. Conclusions: It seems RApatients on LDG had similar impact on disease activity (ESR, CRP, and DAS-28 (ESR), as non-LDG users. While, RA on chronic LDG had lower BMD at spine (L1-4), higher rate of previous fracture that predicts substantial higher 10-year probability of fracture than non-LDG users."

Methods: 56 patients (mean age 43.5 years) with rheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration 8.66 years) and osteoporosis (mean disease duration 5,15 years) were randomized to the two groups in accordance to the type of treatment: group 1 (43% of patients) - medication and physiotherapy (12 sessions of TENS, interferential current, ultrasound), and group 2 (57% of patients) medication and supervised aerobic home training (daily, 6 weeks - stretching, strengthening exercises for hip muscles and mild running for 20 min). Outcome measures were VAS pain, DAS 28, BMD (TScore), HAQ score and Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES). All assessments were performed pre-post intervention and at six month follow-up. Results: All the groups showed similar decrease in pain, DAS-28 values as well as HAQ on the third assessment and there was no significant difference between the groups. We obtained a significant improvement in ASES (p<0.05) and T-score at six month follow-up (p<0.01) after supervised home training. Conclusions: All of the two therapeutic approaches were found to be effective in diminishing pain and disability in osteoporosis rheumatoid arthritis females with chronic dorsal pain, but aerobic training was found to be more effective in improving BMD (TScore) and psychological status. Type and duration of physical training must be individualized to each patient, in accordance with functional status of rheumatoid arthritis. Our results confirm the literature data - physical activity is an interesting therapy for the prevention and treatment of bone loss and osteoporosis because it has no adverse side effects, it is low cost, and it confers additional benefits such as postural stability and fall prevention."
9262632,,10.1097/hcr.0000000000000309,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is attributable to traditional CVD risk factors as well as increased levels of systemic inflammation (symptom of the RA). As exercise is known to decrease CVD risk factors/inflammation guidelines recommend regular exercise, such as cardiac rehabilitation (CR), for primary/secondary CVD prevention. However, CR is rarely recommended for RA patients despite their elevated CVD risk. Thus, the purpose of this interventional trial is to determine whether a 12-week CR program is feasible for RA patients and if so, does it decrease CVD risk without exacerbating RA. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial whereby 60 participants with RA will be recruited and randomly assigned to either standard of care (SOC) treatment (CON) or SOC plus a 12-week CR program (CRH; education plus two 60 min aerobic exercise sessions/week). Exercise is performed at 60-80% of heart rate reserve. Outcome measures (Framingham Risk Score (FRS), resting heart rate, blood pressure (BP), blood lipids, systemic inflammation, Clinical Disease Assessment Index (CDAI) and the Disease Activity Score (DAS-28)) are assessed pre- (week-0) and post-intervention (week-13). Results: To date 65 individuals have been screened, 47 were eligible to participate in the trial and 16 consented (34%). Eight female participants (CON n = 5; CRH, n = 3; age 67.4 +/- 5.7 and 61.3 +/- 11.9 years, respectively) have completed the trial. In the CRH group, SOC plus CR resulted in reductions in systolic (-6.5%) and diastolic (-4.2%) BP as well as blood lipids (total cholesterol -4.9%, LDL -3.1%). An 8.2% decrease in the FRS was also observed in the CRH group. Interestingly, increases in both the DAS-28 (15.5%) and the CDAI (17.7%) were observed in the CRH. As this is an ongoing trial levels of inflammation have not yet been analyzed. Conclusion: Early results suggest the SOC plus CR does not reduce symptoms associated with RA, but does have a positive impact on CVD risk factors in RA patients with CVD risk. Thus, CR may represent a suitable intervention to decrease CVD risk in RA patients."

Potential differences were also recorded in nine patients with rheumatoid arthritis being treated with long-term aspirin and five patients on long-term prednisone. Unbuffered aspirin and ethanol ""broke"" the barrier as shown by a rapid fall in potential difference. The effects of aspirin were dose related, with 600 mg causing a greater reduction than 300 mg. The effects of aspirin and ethanol given together were additive and caused the greatest fall in potential difference. Sodium acetylsalicylate did not alter the normal potential difference. Indomethacin, phenylbutazone, and prednisone all failed to cause any change in potential difference. The patients on long-term aspirin and prednisone had readings within the normal range and responded the same as normal subjects to an acute challenge. These studies show that aspirin and ethanol will damage the gastric mucosal barrier but that indomethacin, phenylbutazone, and prednisone do not."

There was a statistically highly significant reduction in pain, duration of morning stiffness, analgesic requirements, and articular index, with increase in grip strength. There was no significant reduction in joint size or temperature. In a subsequent double-blind group-comparative study fenoprofen proved to be as effective as aspirin in relieving the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, with strikingly fewer side effects. Almost half of the patients taking aspirin were unable to tolerate the drug in adequate dosage for six months. The remainder were able to take on average only 4 g daily, and at this dose almost half still complained of tinnitus and deafness.Fenoprofen is likely to be useful for patients who cannot tolerate aspirin and other more toxic anti-inflammatory drugs or whose disease is not of sufficient severity to justify their use."

This method proved to be both valid and useful. Pain relief scores were a better measure of the effectiveness of analgesics than preference.Aspirin, Codis, and Distalgesic were the most effective analgesics tested, with paracetamol, pentazocine, and Ciba 44,328 intermediate between these agents and placebo. Placebo given after an active analgesic was more effective than when given before; this phenomenon was not abolished by telling the patients that apparently identical tablets were, in fact, different or by making them different in colour. The effectiveness of soluble placebo depended on its colour, red being the most effective."

Fenoprofen and naproxen were slightly more effective than the other two drugs but there were striking individual variations in response. Groups of patients could be identified who preferred each of the four drugs. The commonest side effects were those related to the upper gastrointestinal tract; these showed individual variation and seldom occurred with more than one or two of the drugs. Side effects were least common with ibuprofen and naproxen. Since naproxen combined greater effectiveness with a lower incidence of side effects it must be regarded as the first choice among these drugs. It may be necessary to try several drugs before finding the right one for a particular patient."

Fifteen patients, 10 on azathioprine and 5 on penicillamine, had to stop treatment because of side effects; 90 single side effects occurred, 48 in those on penicillamine and 42 in those on azathioprine. After one year both drugs were similar in efficacy and toxicity, but longer-term trials are needed. Both drugs were effective."

Finally a maintenance dose of gold was administered to 49 of these patients, to the other 52 patients placebo injections were administered. For the treatment of RA a high dosage of a gold compound offers no advantage over a low dosage. After a high dosage one can expect a significantly higher number of side effects. The development of toxicity does not influence the ultimate results. A second course of gold has hardly any benificial effect. Prolonged administration of gold is usually well-tolerated; whether it has substantial and sustained therapeutic value remains dubious. Progression of radiological abnormalities can be observed at the same moment that signs and other symptoms of the disease show improvement."

This involved wearing 'copper bracelets' and placebo bracelets (amodised aluminum resembling copper) alternately. These groups, as also a control group, answered questionnaires. The copper bracelets were weighed before and after use. Preliminary results show that, to a significant number of subjects, the wearing of the 'copper bracelet' appeared to have some therapeutic value. A study of the components of sweat and the solubility of copper in sweat was carried out. In five sweat samples, the copper concentration was of the order 2 x 10(-5) M and after equilibrating with copper turnings at room temperature for 24 hours the samples turned blue in colour and contained approximately 2 x 10(-3) M copper. The permeability of skin to copper containing solutions has also been discussed. It has also been shown that the wearing of a 'copper bracelet' results in a weight loss in excess of the body's total burden of copper (100-150 mg). A pair of copper bracelets lost 80 mg in 50 days when worn around the ankles and a copper bracelet worn around the wrist also lost about 90 mg in that time."

The method employs entirely subjective indices and incorporates a daily pain chart for measuring the pain response over the duration of the trial. In addition, the mean number of days withdrawn and patients' satisfaction rating are measured. The statistical method can correct for initial imbalances between groups and allows for the valid comparison of drugs from separate trials. Ten antirheumatic medications were evaluated using this technique in 684 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the results are in agreement with those of previous studies using standard clinical methods. The new method is simple, rapid in performance, economical in terms of cost and time, and has been shown to be sensitive and reproducible. The results indicate that there are no significant differences in efficacy between the currently available non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."

We have performed a crossover comparison of soluble aspirin, diclofenac and the two drugs in combination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to determine whether this had clinical relevance. 36 patients entered the study. There was a high dropout rate on aspirin alone but analysis of completors (22 patients) showed diclofenac either alone or in combination to be superior to aspirin alone on two of the five clinical parameters measured.

The authors demonstrate that BW 91Y in vitro at 600 pg/ml caused a decrease in chemotactic potential as measured by the leading front (LF) assay in neutrophils from both normal volunteers (p less than 0.025) and RA patients. They also demonstrate that BW 91Y caused a significant increase in production of [3H]LTB4 (LTB = leukotriene B) in ionophore-stimulated neutrophils from both normal (p less than 0.025) and RA patients (p less than 0.050) as compared to initial values. BW 91Y caused decreased incorporation and percent distribution of [3H]AA into phosphatidylcholine (PC), with a resultant increase in percent distribution into phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). There was also an increased release of [3H]AA from the PE fraction in BW 91Y-treated cells in response to ionophore stimulation. BW 91Y was found to exhibit a dose-dependent (10(-7) to 10(-4) g/ml) inhibition of the uptake and incorporation of L-[methyl-3H]methionine into the cellular lipids, while at low doses (10(-9) to 10(-5) g/ml) it stimulated the significant uptake and incorporation of [methyl-14C]choline chloride into PC.

After the clinical trial the patients were free to change diet or medication and after approximately one year they were asked to attend a new clinical examination. We compared the change from baseline (i.e. at the time of study entry) to the time of the follow-up examination for diet responders, diet nonresponders and controls who ate an omnivorous diet. The following variables favoured diet responders: pain score, duration of morning stiffness, Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire index, number of tender joints, Ritchie's articular index, number of swollen joints, ESR and platelet count [corrected]. The difference between the three groups were significant for all the clinical variables, except for grip strength. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to laboratory or anthropometric variables.

METHODS: Serial measurements of APF titers (2-fold dilutions) and disease activity variables in a 48-week double blind trial comparing MTX and AZA in 64 patients with RA. APF titers at baseline and during followup, and correlations between APF titers and disease activity variables and their changes from baseline were studied in the patient group as a whole and in the 2 treatment groups.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the APF at baseline in the MTX group and in the AZA group with undiluted serum was 15/31 (48%) and 19/33 (58%), respectively. With serum diluted 1:10 this was about 25% higher. The APF titer ranged from 1/10 to 1/640. No sustained changes in APF titers were observed during followup. Statistically significant correlations were found between APF titers and 2 of the 4 disease activity variables, as well as for their changes from baseline at some time points and were most pronounced in the AZA group. However, no consistent correlation between APF titers and disease activity variables could be established. APF changed from negative to positive during followup in 4 patients (6.3%) and from positive to negative in 4 (6.3%). Changes in APF titer between 2 consecutive measuring points did not exceed 2 dilution steps.
CONCLUSION: The APF titer showed no sustained change during the followup period. There was no consistent correlation between APF titer and disease activity variables. We conclude that serial measurements of the APF in longitudinal studies do not give additional information."

Results in the evaluable cohort of patients demonstrated that gastroduodenal ulcer incidences were lower with misoprostol than placebo for all study periods (0-12 weeks, 7% vs 23%; 0-24 weeks, 11% vs 26%; and 0-52 weeks, 15% vs 31%). Misoprostol did not interfere with the antiarthritic effects of diclofenac. In conclusion, misoprostol coadministered with diclofenac for 12 months to patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis significantly reduced the incidence of diclofenac-induced gastroduodenal ulcers (P < or = 0.018)."

An adequate response was defined as elevation of Hb > or = 120 g/l. Relevant clinical and laboratory assessments were made to evaluate efficacy and secure safety. A significant elevation in Hb from week 10 onwards was noted in twenty-six patients (five drop-outs) out of nine patients receiving placebo (one drop-out) (12 +/- 1.2 g/l vs 4 +/- 0.5 g/l; Hb elevation from 95 g/l to 107 g/l vs 93 g/l to 97 g/l, P < 0.05). Only 14.6%, however, were considered responders according to preset criteria. In the responders a lower initial CRP, a significant reduction in ESR but not in CRP was seen compared to the remaining r-HuEPO group. A significant elevation of energy level was noted in the r-HuEPO group; otherwise, no differences in clinical variables were seen. No serious adverse effects were noted. When analyzing patients receiving oral iron in combination with r-HuEPO and adding five additional, openly selected patients receiving both adequate iron supplementation and r-HuEPO, there was a significant weekly elevation of Hb from week 8 onwards in favor of combination therapy over the ones only receiving r-HuEPO (18 +/- 1.1 g/l vs 7 +/- 1.1 g/l, P < 0.05). The initial six responders had now reached ten of whom seven belonged to the combination therapy group. Response to r-HuEPO in RA patients appears to be dependent on availability of iron and on the degree of inflammation. If r-HuEPO treatment is considered, iron deficiency should always be corrected and strenuous efforts should have been made to control the disease itself."

In this prospective, randomized trial we compared three different treatment regimens for shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip and ankle joints: group 1, injection of rhenium-186; group 2, injection of rhenium-186 in combination with triamcinolone hexacetonide; group 3, injection of triamcinolone hexacetonide alone. Each treatment group included 50 joints. Patients included in the study had to fulfil the following criteria: (1) they had to have a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (ARA criteria 1988), (2) their disease-modifying drug had to be methotrexate, started at least 6 months prior to injection therapy and given for the entire study time, (3) their nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug had to be diclofenac given at a dose of 150 mg/day or less and (4) they were also given prednisolone at a dose of 7.5 mg/day or less. After 3 years of follow-up, 79 joints met these criteria, i.e. 71 joints were excluded from the study: 26 joints because the patients changed the disease-modifying drug (12 joints from group 1, 4 joints from group 2 and 10 joints from group 3); 45 joints because of recurrent synovitis and second-stage treatment (21 joints from group 1, 5 joints from group 2 and 19 joints from group 3). During the follow-up period, joints were assessed for pain, synovitis, joint motion and stage of radiological destruction. Best clinical results and slowest progression in radiological destruction were achieved with the combined injection of rhenium-186 and triamcinolone hexacetonide. Therefore, we recommend this treatment for articulosynovitis with the exception of severe forms, the latter because of the effective penetration range of rhenium-186."

Moreover, +/-4% of patients discontinue treatment because of severe diarrhoea. We investigated whether a water binding agent would diminish the incidence of loose stools and diarrhoea. Endpoints were the patient's general impression of the quality of stools and a daily assessment of stool's frequency/consistency and adverse events. Secondly, some disease activity parameters were used to evaluate whether the bulkforming agent influences the efficacy of auranofin. In this study 269 patients suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) were treated with auranofin 6 mgr daily for a period of six months. Simultaneously the patients were randomly treated with either a bulkforming agent (Volcolon: psyllium fibres) or placebo. Results show a 15% incidence of loose stools and diarrhoea during treatment with auranofin. During the treatment period the patients' general impression of defecation consistency showed a shift to softer types. The changes in defecation consistency was not significantly different between groups (Intention-to-treat analysis: c2=4.01; p=0.13). Also, the percentage of patients experiencing episodes of diarrhoea (reported as an adverse experience) was not different (14% of the patients treated with bulkformer versus 15% with placebo). During the first month 7% (n=5) of placebo treated patients reported short episodes of watery stools versus none in the bulkformer treated group. The percentage of days with loose or watery stools, reported on the diary cards, was consistently lower in bulkformer treated patients. Both groups improved equally with respect to disease activity parameters. Sixty-eight percent of patients continued auranofin treatment after the study period. In conclusion, these data do not support adjuvant therapy with a bulkforming agent on initiation of auranofin therapy. The overall low incidence of loose stools and diarrhoea suggests that a dose increase to 9 mgr daily is an option to enhance the efficacy of auranofin treatment."

METHODS: Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover trial of 13 weeks' duration. Nineteen children with the diagnosis of JRA, fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria, who had been receiving MTX for at least 6 months and whose disease status had remained stable for at least one month before entry were enrolled in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 1 mg/day of liquid folic acid or a liquid placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a one week washout period, and subsequent crossover to the alternate form for another 6 weeks. Disease activity indicators, including swollen joint count, duration of morning stiffness, physician and patient global assessment, and C-reactive protein, were assessed at study entry and at 6 and 13 weeks.
RESULTS: One patient flared during the first 2 weeks while taking placebo, requiring study withdrawal and exclusion from outcome analysis. For the remaining 18 patients, there was no statistical difference in disease activity indicators with folic acid treatment compared to placebo.
CONCLUSION: Supplementation with 1 mg/day of folic acid may not affect the clinical efficacy of oral weekly MTX in children with JRA."

Results of clinical study showed that the effective rate of RNC was 98.33%, clinical cure rate was 26.67%, quite effective rate was 64.16%, remission (effectiveness) was 7.5%, inefficacy was 1.67%, therefore, RNC is the most efficacious drug, which takes rapid effect. It has the better function of eliminating joint swelling and stopping gain, the rate of its impelling erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and RF to return to normal and to decrease is high, it proves to be powerful potent for withdrawing hormone, its efficacy is stable and the side effects of it are few. Its efficacy is obviously superior to that of indomethacin and the other antirheumatics used clinically at present.

Twenty-five children were measured from each of 3 diagnostic categories: juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), cerebral palsy (CP), and nondisabled (ND) (N = 75). Five pairs of raters each measured five children from each diagnostic category. Generalizability theory provided a framework to determine the standard error of measurement (SEM) associated with each goniometer under different situations. Results revealed that the amount of error associated with each goniometer was similar when both rater and time were random, and ranged from +6.50 for the CP group to +4.40 for the JRA group. Error was reduced by almost half in all diagnostic groups by fixing either occasion or rater, or by taking the average of one rater's two consecutive measurements. Clinically, the goniometers can be used interchangeably and averaging of measurements is recommended. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved."

After a two week washout period, patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: etodolac (239 patients) or aspirin (236 patients). Patients were titrated at weekly intervals (Week 1-4) to the individual effective dose within the following ranges: etodolac 100-600 mg/day; aspirin 3600-4800 mg/day. Patients generally remained at their final dose level throughout the maintenance period (Weeks 5-51). The mean duration of treatment was 238 and 236 days for patients on etodolac and aspirin, respectively. Etodolac proved effective in the relief of the signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis as documented by improvement of most efficacy variables at all timepoints following the titration period. The degree of improvement was clinically equivalent to that of the reference compound, aspirin. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were few with etodolac treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms and EENT-related complaints occurred less frequently in the etodolac-treated group. Thus, etodolac appears to be as effective as aspirin, but better tolerated in the long-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved."

There is no curative treatment for SS, however, in recent years the influence of nutrients on autoimmune processes has attracted increasing attention. LongoVital (LV) (DK. Reg. No. 5178/75) is an herbal-based tablet enriched with the recommended daily doses of vitamins. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether 4 months' daily intake of LV as compared to placebo would affect clinical and laboratory disease parameters in patients with SS. Methods: Forty patients with SS participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, clinical, 8 month cross-over study. Group A (n = 22) received LV during the first 4 months and Group B (n = 18) LV during the last 4 months. Results: The unstimulated salivary flow rate increased during the LV period in Group A (p < 0.001). The stimulated salivary flow rate increased in Group B during the LV period (p < 0.05), and in Group A during the subsequent 4 months on placebo (p < 0.05). The rose bengal score decreased in Group B during (p < 0.01) and in Group A after the LV intake (p < 0.05).

Patients and Methods: Ten men and 50 women (aged 21 to 73 years, mean 57 years) with RA were included. The two groups were comparable before treatment. Efficacy was assessed by the patient every evening by: (a) pain scores rated on a 100 mm visual analogue scale [VAS]; (b) discomfort scores defining the activity level reduction [none, mild, moderate, severe]: (c) duration of morning stiffness; and (d) number of awakenings caused by the pain during the previous night. At the end of the study overall efficacy was assessed by the patient on a 5-point verbal scale and by the desire to continue the treatment (yes, no). Pain scores on VAS and on a 5-point verbal scale and Ritchie Index were assessed before [day 0 (D0)] and after (D7) treatment. Any adverse effects were recorded continuously during the study and overall tolerability was assessed at the end of the study. Results: Analgesic efficacy was not significantly different between the two groups on all criteria: global efficacy (good or very good: PC = 47%, DI = 44%), desire to continue the treatment (PC = 57%, DI = 47%), evolution of daily VAS pain score, difference from D0 to D7 on VAS (PC = -31.5 mm, DI = -23.4 mm) and the Ritchie index (PC = -2.2, DI = -2.2), duration of morning stiffness, number of awakenings. The number of patients presenting adverse effects (PC = 8, DI = 9). the number of withdrawals as a result of adverse effects causing cessation of treatment (PC = 3, DI = 1), and the overall tolerability assessment were not significantly different (good or very good: PC = 82%, DI = 87%).

In addition, it contains questions on the state of physical, social and emotional function and overall health, and their relation to RA. We evaluated MACTAR's feasibility and validity (content validity, construct validity, and responsiveness).
METHODS: A randomized trial of combined treatment in 155 patients with early RA; patients' mean age at baseline was 50 years and median disease duration since diagnosis was 4 months.
RESULTS: Feasibility: MACTAR requires trained interviewers. In the trial, interviews took about 15 min. In longer term followup, activities selected at baseline may become less relevant as the pattern of disability changes. Followup from 153 patients (99%) was available. At least 5 impaired activities were identified and ranked by 147 patients (95%); interviewers could follow 99% of these. The scoring system proved complex and required amendments. Content validity: Although its main focus is physical function, the MACTAR also contains generic questions; 75% of the patients named at least one impaired activity from the category ""mobility."" Only 48% were covered by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) items. Construct validity: MACTAR scores correlate highly with other functional indices and with measures of disease activity. Responsiveness: At 16 weeks the standardized response mean for the total MACTAR score in the combined-treatment group was excellent, at 2.2. Items that directly address change were even more responsive.
CONCLUSION: The MACTAR interview is a valid and highly responsive instrument to assess change in functional ability of patients with early RA with active disease. It provides insight into problems--mainly of physical function--that really matter to patients. For standard clinical trials and clinical care, feasibility of the MACTAR is limited and the simpler HAQ remains the instrument of choice."

9263133,,10.2165/00003495-200363001-00006,"Joint pain is the main complaint in patients affected by osteoarthritis (OA), and NSAIDs are commonly used to treat pain associated with OA. Over the past few years, cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors have been proved to have certain advantages over non-selective NSAIDs and have been increasingly used for pain management in patients with OA.
OBJECTIVE: the main objective of this randomised, double-blind, within-patient study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of three COX-2 inhibitors in 30 patients affected by symptomatic OA of the knee. We evaluated the effects of oral nimesulide (100mg), celecoxib (200mg) and rofecoxib (25mg). Each drug was administered for 7 days.
METHODS: analgesic efficacy was determined using the patient's assessment of pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and by total pain relief over 3 hours (TOPAR3) on the first and last days of treatment. In addition, the overall analgesic efficacy and tolerability were determined by a global assessment by the patient at the end of each week of treatment, using 5-point categorical scales. At the end of the study, each patient was asked about which of the three forms of treatment they would choose as a continuation of the pain therapy.
RESULTS: taking all the results into consideration, nimesulide proved to be significantly more effective in providing symptomatic relief than did celecoxib and rofecoxib. Furthermore, nimesulide provided more rapid relief of pain associated with walking than did the other two drugs tested. Patients expressed similar preference for nimesulide and rofecoxib, but a lesser preference for celecoxib treatment. No patient withdrew from the study because of adverse events and the three different forms of treatment were generally safe and well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: the present data confirm our previous observations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, further suggesting that nimesulide represents an effective agent for the treatment of joint pain, with particular reference to the rapid onset of its analgesic effect."

METHODS: A total of 45 patients with longterm RA were randomized into 3 groups to receive 8 weeks of treatment with placebo (n = 15), simvastatin (20 mg/day, n = 15), or quinapril (10 mg/day, n = 15) as an adjunct to existing antirheumatic drug treatment. Factors with a role in the development of endothelial dysfunction, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, nitric oxide (NO), and serum cytokine concentrations including interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured at baseline and in the posttreatment period. Brachial artery vasodilator responses were assessed by high resolution ultrasound to evaluate endothelial functions.
RESULTS: Simvastatin treatment significantly decreased serum CRP and TNF-a [from 14 +/- 6 to 7 +/- 3 mg/l (p = 0.025) and 30 +/- 5 to 16 +/- 4 pg/ml (p = 0.012), respectively], while quinapril had no significant changes in these 2 measures. IL-1beta and IL-6 showed insignificant changes in patients in the 2 drug groups. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was improved significantly in the simvastatin group [from 5.3 +/- 1.1% to 8.9 +/- 1.4% (p = 0.025)], while there was no difference in endothelium-independent vasodilatation [9.0 +/- 1.8% to 11.2 +/- 2.5% (p = 0.17)]. The quinapril group showed no significant changes in both types of vasodilation although there was a tendency to an increase in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation [from 6.1 +/- 0.8% to 7.8 +/- 0.7% (p = 0.06)]. Treatment with the 2 drugs had no significant effects on resting arterial diameter.
CONCLUSION: We show that simvastatin 20 mg daily improves endothelial function in patients with RA. Its beneficial effect may be attributed to lowering CRP and TNF-alpha concentrations. ACE inhibition with daily 10 mg quinapril was found to have no significant effects on inflammatory markers and endothelial vasodilator response."

In Japan, histamine-2 receptor antagonists are frequently prescribed, but the literature regarding their efficacy is limited. In this study, we compare the effects of famotidine and rebamipide on NSAID-associated gastric mucosal lesions using upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
METHODS: this study examined 112 patients taking NSAIDs for either gastric hemorrhage or erosion. Before treatment, the patients were assessed by endoscopy. Using blind randomization, patients were divided into two groups: group F (famotidine, 20 mg/day) and group R (rebamipide, 300 mg/day). Efficacy was examined 4 weeks later using endoscopy.
RESULTS: after treatment, the Lanza score decreased significantly in group F (P < 0.001) but not in group R (P = 0.478). The change in the Lanza score in group F was significantly greater (P = 0.002) than that in group R.

In particular, data on quality of life is rarely reported. This is especially important because patients treated with hydrotherapy often report an enhanced sense of well-being. We report a randomised controlled trial in which we compared the effects of hydrotherapy with exercises on land on overall response to treatment, physical function and quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: One hundred and fifteen patients with RA were randomised to receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy or similar exercises on land for 6 weeks. Our primary outcome was a self-rated global impression of change--a measure of treatment effect on a 7-point scale ranging from 1(very much worse) to 7 (very much better) assessed immediately on completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes including EuroQol health related quality of life, EuroQol health status valuation, HAQ, 10 metre walk time and pain scores were collected at baseline, after treatment and 3 months later. Binary outcomes were analysed by Fisher's exact test and continuous variables by Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney tests.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. Significantly more patients treated with hydrotherapy (40/46, 87%) were much better or very much better than the patients treated with land exercise (19/40, 47.5%), p < 0.001 Fisher's exact test. Eleven patients allocated land exercise failed to complete treatment compared with 4 patients allocated hydrotherapy (p = 0.09). Sensitivity analyses confirmed an advantage for hydrotherapy if we assumed non-completers would all not have responded (response rates 70% versus 38%; p < 0.001) or if we assumed that non-completers would have had the same response as completers (response rates 82% versus 55% p = 0.002). Ten metre walk time improved after treatment in both cases (median pre-treatment time for both groups combined 10.9 seconds, post-treatment 9.1 s, and 3 months later 9.6 s). There was however no difference between treatment groups. Similarly there were no significant differences between groups in terms of changes to HAQ, EQ-5D utility score, EQ VAS and pain VAS.
CONCLUSION: Patients with RA treated with hydrotherapy are more likely to report feeling much better or very much better than those treated with land exercises immediately on completion of the treatment programme. This perceived benefit was not reflected by differences between groups in 10-metre walk times, functional scores, quality of life measures and pain scores."

Eighty-five subjects with RA in treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) drugs (infliximab) were enrolled into the study and randomized into either an experimental group (46, EG) or a control group (39, CG). We organized four EG meetings, which included information on pathophysiology and evolution of RA, joint protection during normal activities of daily living, suggestions on how to adapt the surrounding environment, and self-learning exercises to perform at home. Sociodemographic characteristics and degree of knowledge of the disease, measured by the Health Service Interview (HSI), were recorded at baseline. The outcome measures included the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 (AIMS2), and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which were administered at the beginning and end of the trial. Thirty-six patients from the EG (7 men and 29 women; mean age 54.2 years) and 34 from the CG (6 men and 28 women; mean age 52.2 years) completed the trial. No statistical differences in baseline evaluations were found between the two groups. According to the answers given on the HSI, the majority of our patients had poor knowledge of RA and its consequences. After a mean time of 8 months, the patients receiving educational training displayed a significant decrease, compared to the CG, in the VAS (p = 0.001), HAQ (p = 0.000), and physical (p =0.000), symptoms (p = 0.049), and social interaction (p = 0.045) scores on the AIMS2, but not in other items.

METHODS: At start of the first disease modifying antirheumatic drug, 67 patients with early, active RA were randomized to either 7.5 mg prednisolone daily (n = 34) or no prednisolone (n = 33). In the prednisolone group, 21 were treated for 2 years and 13 continuously. After a mean of 5 years intima-media thickness (IMT) and calculated intima-media area (cIMa) of the carotid arteries were determined by B-mode ultrasound. Endothelial function was determined by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery.
RESULTS: IMT [median (interquartile range) 0.675 mm (0.58-0.82) vs 0.673 mm (0.0.62-0.80)], cIMa [13.7 mm2 (11.45-20.37) vs 14.1 mm2 (12.34-17.38)], prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques (82.3% vs 81.9%), and endothelial function [FMD% (mean +/- SD) 3.88% +/- 2.8 vs 3.74% +/- 2.9] did not differ between patients treated with and those not treated with prednisolone. There were no differences in lumen diameter of carotid arteries, or levels of lipoproteins, glucose, and blood pressure.

METHODS: The study employs a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA), traditional Chinese acupuncture (TCA) and sham acupuncture (Sham) in patients with RA. All patients received 20 sessions over a period of 10 weeks. Six acupuncture points were chosen. Primary outcome is the changes in the pain score. Secondary outcomes included the changes in the ACR core disease measures, DAS 28 score and the number of patients who achieved ACR 20 at week 10.
RESULTS: From 80 eligible patients, 36 patients with mean age of 58 +/- 10 years and disease duration of 9.3 +/- 6.4 years were recruited. Twelve patients were randomized to each group. Twelve, 10 and 7 patients from the EA, TCA and Sham group respectively completed the study at 20 weeks (p < 0.03); all except one of the premature dropouts were due to lack of efficacy. At week 10, the pain score remained unchanged in all 3 groups. The number of tender joints was significantly reduced for the EA and TCA groups. Physician's global score was significantly reduced for the EA group and patient's global score was significantly reduced for the TCA group. All the outcomes except patient's global score remained unchanged in the Sham group.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study has allowed a number of recommendations to be made to facilitate the design of a large-scale trial, which in turn will help to clarify the existing evidence base on acupuncture for RA.

Hanshibi granule was composed of fuzhi (Radix Aconiti Praeparata), huangqi (Radix Astragali), weilingxian (Radix Clematidis), more than 10 herbs, 10 g each bag. Zhengqing fengtongning tablet is 20 mg each tablet. Methods: Based on the randomization and sequence of visiting, the cases were divided into observing group and the control at the ratio of 3:1. In the observing group, hanshibi granule was administrated, 1 bag/time, 3 times/day, infused with water. In the control, zhengqing fengtongning tablet was administered orally, 2 tablets/time, 3 times/day; 1 week later, if there was no harmful reaction, it was administered 3 tablets/ time, 3 times/day. For rheumatic arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the drugs were taken for 2 months as 1 course, and for knee osteoarthritis, the drugs were taken for 1 month as 1 course. The changes of ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP) and rheumatic factor (RF) and uric acid (UA) were determined and recorded. Criteria on evaluation: 1 Evaluation on therapeutic effects on syndromes: Remarkable effect: the symptoms were improved remarkably after treatment and symptom integral was 0-1 score or decreased by > 2/3. Effect: the symptoms were improved after treatment and the symptom integral was decreased by > 1/3. 2 Evaluation on therapeutic effects on symptoms: Remarkable effect: The symptom integral was reduced to 0 score or reduced by 2 scores after treatment, such as joint pain, swelling, tender pain, morning stiffness and functional impairment. Effect: the integral was reduced by 1 score after treatment. 3 Evaluation on total therapeutic effects on diseases: Remarkable effect: the symptoms and physical signs disappeared basically, the main laboratory indexes were improved remarkably and reduced by > 50%. Effect: The symptoms and physical signs were alleviated and the main laboratory indexes were improved. Main outcome measures: 1 Total clinical therapeutic effect, therapeutic effect on different symptoms and diseases between two groups. 2 Safety of hanshibi granule. Results: Totally 400 cases were employed, of which, 300 cases were in observing group and 100 cases in the control. In observing group, 19 cases were dropped out and 281 cases were in the statistics. In the control, 6 cases were dropped out and 94 cases were in the statistics. 1 Comparison of total clinical therapeutic effects between two groups: The total effective rate in the observing group was higher significantly than that in the control (94.31%, 84.04%, P < 0.01). 2 Comparison of therapeutic effects on different symptoms between two groups: There was no significant difference in the therapeutic effects on joint pain, swelling, tender pain, functional disturbance and morning stiffness between two groups (P > 0.05). 3 Comparison of therapeutic effects on different diseases between two groups: There was no significant difference in the therapeutic effects on RA, AS and knee osteoarthritis (P > 0.05). 4 Safety of hanshibi granule: abnormal urine routine for a part of cases before treatment was improved after treatment. ST-T wave alternation in ECG for a part of cases before treatment was not aggravated obviously after medication. Conclusion: Both hanshibi granule and zhengqing fengtong tablet, the control drug improves significantly joint pain, swelling, tender pain, functional impairment and morning stiffness in rheumatism due to blockage of cold and damp, in which, the effect of intervention of hanshibi granule is superior to that of the control drug, without obvious harmful reactions; therefore, such drug can be taken as a safe and effective one for rheumatism due to blockage of cold and damp."

METHODS: ninety-seven patients with active RA assigned in the SXTI group were treated with high or low dose SXTI (6 ml/d or 8 ml/d) combined with conventional therapy and the 30 in the control group treated with conventional therapy alone. Thompson index, ritchie index, time of morning stiffness (TMS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plasma fibrinogen (fib) in patients were determined before treatment (T0), by the end of the 1st (T1), second (T2) and 4th (T3) week of treatment, respectively, AS well AS the SXTI associated adverse reaction monitored. RESULTS: marked improvement of all indexes, including thompson index, ritche index, TMS, ESR and fib, was shown in the SXTI groups at T1 (P < 0.01), but in the control group, it only appeared at T3 (P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, TMS, ESR and fib at T1, thompson index and ritche index at T2 in the SXTI groups were significantly improved (P < 0.01), especially significant in the high dose group (P < 0.01). However, hands edema appeared in 2 patients, foot edema in 1 and fullness sensation of head in 1 in the high dose SXTI group. The dose was forced to redue to 6 ml/d, and then all the symptoms were improved. CONCLUSION: SXTI shows good efficacy with less adverse reaction in treating patients with active RA, and better efficacy was obtained at the dose of 8 ml/d."

METHODS: eighty-four patients were randomly assigned to two groups. All were treated with the routine therapy with diclofenac sodium, leflunomide and prednisone, but for the 43 patients in the treatment group PNS was given additionally. The therapeutic course was 28 days for both groups. Clinical efficacy and change of indexes including platelet counts, immnuoglobulins (igg, iga, igm), complement (C)3, rheumatoid factor (RF), c-reactive protein (CRP), ceruloplasmin (CER), haptoglobin (HPT), and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) were observed. RESULTS: significant improvement of clinical symptoms, including the joint swelling index, joint tenderness index, joint pain index, time of morning stiffness and VAS revealed in both groups after treatment, and the effect in the treatment group was better (P<0.05 or P<0.01). PLT, CER, AAG, HPT, CRP, igg, iga, igm, C3 and RF were lowered in both groups (P<0.01), but the lowering in PLT, CER, AAG and CRP in the treatment group was more significant than that in the control group respectively (P < 0.05 or p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: PNS can significantly improve the condition of patients, enhance the therapeutic effect in treating RA, through regulating the disordered immunity and improving the effect of anti-inflammatory and analgesia."

METHODS: three hundred and ninety-seven patients, with confirmed diagnosis of active RA, were randomly assigned to the WM group (194 patients) and the CM group (203 patients). The WM applied covered non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents and slow acting medicine; and the CM given included basic remedy and syndrome differentiating medication. Related blood biochemical and immunological indexes were determined before and after treatment to screen out the cartilage erosion related factors and to compare the influence of CM and WM on them. RESULTS: patients' peripheral red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) count were changed closely along with their degree of cartilage erosion. RBC count increased in the CM group and PLT count lowered in the WM group after treatment, all showed statistical significance; comparison of the two indexes between the two groups showed that statistical difference presented in RBC but not in PLT count.

However, no studies are available on the functional and patient-relevant outcomes after computer-assisted knee replacement. In a prospective, randomized trial comparing 27 computer-assisted TKAs with 25 conventional implantations, the Knee Society Score was used to assess functional status, and the WOMAC questionnaire was used to record the disease-specific, patient-relevant outcome. At a twelve-month follow-up no significant difference was detected between the two patient groups in either the scores or the number of complications and range of postoperative knee flexion. The results are in agreement with those reported in other studies on the effect of conventional TKA. With the patient group of this size it can be concluded that computer-navigated TKA gives short-term resuits comparable with those achieved by conventional methods of implantation."

METHODS: From October 2000 to October 2007, 707 cases (816 knees) underwent TKA. All the TKA knees were divided equally into former and latter groups according to the operation time (408 knees for each group). In the former group (October 2000 to January 2005, n=350), there were 63 males (84 knees) and 287 females (324 knees), aging (63.5 +/- 7.8) years. A total of 198 left knees affected and 210 right knees affected; 292 single knees affected and 58 both knees affected. There were 304 knees of osteoarthritis, 84 knees of rheumatoid arthritis and 20 knees of other disease. The disease course was (9.3 +/- 5.6) years. The knee range of motion (ROM) was (97.2 +/- 8.7) degrees, the HSS score was 47.4 +/- 12.2. In the latter group (January 2005 to October 2007, n=357), there were 77 males (92 knees) and 280 females (316 knees), aging (62.7 +/- 6.3) years. A total of 221 left knees affected and 187 right knees affected; 306 single knees affected and 51 both knees affected. There were 278 knees of osteoarthritis, 109 knees of rheumatoid arthritis and 21 knees of other disease. The disease course was (8.6 +/- 5.1) years. The knee ROM was (101.1 +/- 10.3) degrees, the HSS score was 49.3 +/- 11.2. We modified the method of lateral patellar retinaculum release and used a new femoral rotational alignment technique in the latter group. The intraoperative and postoperative complications were divided into mild, moderate and severe. The HSS score, ROM and complications of the knee were compared and analyzed statistically during the follow-up.
RESULTS: The former group was followed up 5.3 years (1 to 7 years), complications occurred in 278 knees (68.1%), including mild in 136 knees (33.3%), moderate in 135 knees (33.1%) and severe in 7 knees (1.7%). The latter group was followed up 2.1 years (0.5 to 3.5 years), complications occurred in 159 knees (39.0%), including mild in 111 knees (27.2%), moderate in 47 knees (11.5%) and severe in 1 knee (0.2%), and there was significant difference between them (P < 0.001). There was significant difference in increased ROM between the former group (6.0 +/- 3.7) degrees and the latter group (14.4 +/- 4.2) degrees after operation (P < 0.05). There was significant difference in increased HSS score between the former group (36.9 +/- 3.7) and the latter group (44.0 +/- 4.2) after operation (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The TKA is a complex operation with innumerable potential complications. To accumulate operative experience and improve surgical skills are the key points to reduce the operation-correlated complications."

The effects of n-3 LC-PUFA-supplemented dairy products on inflammation and immunological parameters, biomarkers of oxidative stress, serum lipids, and on disease activity were determined in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Forty-five subjects (forty-three females and two males) were randomly divided into two groups in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Both groups received placebo or verum products consecutively for 3 months with a 2-month washout phase between the two periods. Blood samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of each period. The dairy products generally improved serum lipids by increasing HDL and lowering lipoprotein a. The n-3 LC-PUFA supplements act to lower TAG. Additionally, a decreased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cylo-oxygenase-2 expression was found in patients who had consumed the enriched dairy products. The majority of the CD analysed were not influenced, although n-3 LC-PUFA did suppress the immune response as lymphocytes and monocytes were found to be significantly decreased. The n-3 LC-PUFA did not increase the biomarkers of oxidative stress such as 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and 15-keto-dihydro PGF(2alpha), and DNA damage like 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine. The long-term consumption of dairy products (2 x 12 weeks) diminished the excretion of hydroxypyridinium crosslinks, and favoured the diastolic blood pressure. The consumption of moderate doses of n-3 LC-PUFA in combination with dairy products did not improve the disease activity. However, there is evidence of cardioprotective effects. Furthermore, the long-term consumption of dairy products acts against the cartilage and bone destruction in RA."

METHODS: Patients with early RA (n=158) not previously treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, participating in a treatment trial (CIMESTRA study) were examined at inclusion for MBL2 pooled structural genotypes (O/O, A/O, A/A), regulatory MBL2 promoter polymorphism in position -221 (XX, XY, YY), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 2 antibodies (anti-CCP2), disease activity by Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28 score), physical disability by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, and erosive changes in hands and feet (Sharp-van der Heijde score).
RESULTS: Eight patients were homozygous MBL2 defective (O/O), 101 belonged to an intermediate group, and 49 were MBL2 high producers (YA/YA). Anti-CCP was present in 93 patients (59%). High scores of disease activity, C-reactive protein-based DAS28 (p=0.02), and physical disability by HAQ (p=0.01) were associated with high MBL2 expression genotypes in a gene-dose dependent way, but only in anti-CCP-positive patients. At this early stage of the disease there was no association with erosion score from radiographs.

METHODS: Sixty-eight pSS patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the treatment group (35 cases) treated by Chinese herbal medicine for strengthening qi, nourishing yin, and removing stasis combined with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablet (HCQ) and the control group (33 cases) treated by HCQ only. Both were treated for 3 months. Before and after treatment, immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and OPN level were measured. The QOL in patients was evaluated using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) before and after treatment. Thirty healthy females were taken as the normal control.
RESULTS: Before treatment, levels of IgG, ESR, and OPN in patients were higher than those in the normal control. After 3 months of treatment, those in both treatment groups decreased but were lower in the treatment group than those in the control group (P<0.05). The scores of 8 dimensions of SF-36 were lower in the pSS patients than those in the normal control (P<0.05) and higher in the treatment group than in the control group after treatment (P<0.05). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the levels of OPN and the levels of IgG and ESR, and a negative correlation between OPN levels and the overall score of SF-36 (P<0.05).

The effects of these alone or combined were examined in patients with arthritis in a randomized controlled trial.
DESIGN: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis were randomized into four groups in a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel designed study. Patients received the respective capsules (1: 3.0 g n-3 LC-PUFA/d; 2: 3.2 g Œ≥-linolenic acid/d; 3: 1.6 g n-3 LC-PUFA + 1.8 g Œ≥-linolenic acid/d; 4: 3.0 g olive oil) for a twelve week period. Clinical status was evaluated and blood samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the period. Differences before and after intervention were tested with paired t-test or with Wilcoxon test for non-normal data distribution.
RESULTS: 60 patients (54 rheumatoid arthritis, 6 psoriatic arthritis) were randomised, 47 finished per protocol. In group 1, the ratio of arachidonic acid (AA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) decreased from 6.5 ¬± 3.7 to 2.7 ¬± 2.1 in plasma lipids and from 25.1 ¬± 10.1 to 7.2 ¬± 4.7 in erythrocyte membranes (p ‚â§ 0.001). There was no significant influence on AA/EPA ratio due to interventions in group 2-4. In group 2, the intake of Œ≥-linolenic acid resulted in a strong rise of Œ≥-linolenic acid and dihomo-Œ≥-linolenic acid concentrations in plasma lipids, cholesteryl esters, and erythrocyte membranes. The combination of n-3 LC-PUFA and Œ≥-linolenic acid (group 3) led to an increase of Œ≥-linolenic acid and dihomo-Œ≥-linolenic acid concentrations in plasma lipids, cholesteryl esters, and erythrocyte mem-branes. This increase was only half of that in group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of eicosanoid precursor FAs was influenced by an intake of n-3 LC-PUFA and Œ≥-linolenic acid suggesting a possible benefit for therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases.

This study was performed to assess the usefulness of color vision, photo stress recovery time (PSRT), and visual evoked potentials (VEP) in early detection of ocular toxicity of HCQ, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 86 patients were included in the study and divided into three groups: (1) with history of HCQ use: interventional 1 (Int.1) without fundoscopic changes and Int.2 with fundoscopic changes; and (2) without history of HCQ use, as control. Visual field, color vision, PSRT and VEP results were recorded for all patients and the effect of age, disease duration, treatment duration and cumulative dose of HCQ on each test was assessed in each group. There was a significant relationship among PSRT and age, treatment duration, cumulative dose of HCQ and disease duration (P<0.001 for all). Color vision was normal in all the cases. P100 amplitude was not different between the three groups (P=0.846), but P100 latency was significantly different (P=0.025) and for Int.2 it was greater than the others. The percentage of abnormal visual fields for Int.2 was more than Int.1 and control groups (P=0.002 and P=0.005 respectively), but Int.1 and control groups were not significantly different (P>0.50). In the early stages of maculopathy, P100 latencies of VEP and PSRT are useful predictors of HCQ ocular toxicity. In patients without ocular symptoms and fundoscopic changes, the P100 latency of VEP predicts more precisely than the others."

This multicenter, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-finding study investigated the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with active RA despite ongoing therapy at stable doses of methotrexate.
METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive one of four regimens, in addition to methotrexate, for 12 weeks: canakinumab 150 mg subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (q4wk), canakinumab 300 mg SC (2 injections of 150 mg SC) every 2 weeks, a 600 mg intravenous loading dose of canakinumab followed by 300 mg SC every 2 weeks', or placebo SC every 2 weeks.
RESULTS: Among 274 patients with evaluable efficacy data, the percentage of responders according to American College of Rheumatology 50 criteria (the primary endpoint, based on a 28-joint count) was significantly higher with canakinumab 150 mg SC q4wk than with placebo (26.5% vs. 11.4%, respectively; p = 0.028). Compared to placebo, this dosage of canakinumab was also associated with significantly more favorable responses at week 12 with respect to secondary endpoints including the Disease Activity Score 28, scores on the Health Assessment Questionnaire and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, swollen 28-joint count, and patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity. No safety concerns were raised with canakinumab therapy, particularly with regard to infections. Few injection-site reactions occurred.
CONCLUSION: The addition of canakinumab 150 mg SC q4wk improves therapeutic responses among patients who have active RA despite stable treatment with methotrexate.

9263363,,10.1186/ar916,"We evaluated whether or not the effect of adalimumab (ADA) in combination with the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards) other than methotrexate (MTX) is comparable to the ADA+MTX therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 216 patients with active RA at kohnan kakogawa hospital and kobe university hospital were enrolled. Clinical and functional outcomes were compared among 4 groups, ADA alone (A group), ADA + MTX (B group), ADA + MTX + other dmards (C group), and ADA + other dmards (D group), and the retention rates of ADA were evaluated with or without MTX. CRP was significantly decreased from initial measurement at 1 month in all 4 groups, but the continuous efficacy with the statistical significance at all measurement points were observed only in combination with MTX (P<0.05), which was reflected by significantly higher retention rates. Similarly, the disease activities were improved, and particularly the remission rates (DAS28-CRP < 2.3) of A, b and c groups (>42.9%) were higher than that of d group (29.4%) at 2 year. An index of patients' basic activities of daily living, M-HAQ score of A, b and c groups was also better than that of d group. While, looking at the mean changes of M-HAQ from the baseline at 2 years, potential effect of other dmards on M-HAQ was also suggested. The results show that ADA + MTX therapy is significantly superior than ADA + other dmards in ameliorating RA."

METHODS: this multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled study involving 99 sites in Japan was designed to compare the efficacy of lansoprazole (15 mg daily) with gefarnate (50 mg twice daily). Patients with a history of gastric or duodenal ulcers who required long-term NSAID therapy were randomized to receive lansoprazole 15 mg daily (n = 185) or gefarnate 50 mg twice daily (n = 181) and followed up for 12 months or longer prospectively.
RESULTS: the cumulative incidence of gastric or duodenal ulcer at days 91, 181, and 361 from the start of the study was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method as 3.3, 5.9, and 12.7%, respectively, in the lansoprazole group versus 18.7, 28.5, and 36.9%, respectively, in the gefarnate group. The risk for ulcer development was significantly (log-rank test, P < 0.0001) lower in the lansoprazole group than in the gefarnate group, with the hazard ratio being 0.2510 (95% CI 0.1400-0.4499). A long-term follow-up study showed an acceptable safety profile for low-dose lansoprazole therapy, with diarrhea as the most frequent adverse event.
CONCLUSION: lansoprazole was superior to gefarnate in reducing the risk of gastric or duodenal ulcer recurrence in patients with a definite history of gastric or duodenal ulcers who required long-term NSAID therapy."
9263373,,10.1371/journal.pone.0030123,"OBJECTIVES: Fatigue is a major cause of disability in primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS). Fatigue has similarities with sickness behaviour in animals; the latter mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular interleukin (IL)-1, acting on neuronal brain cells. We hypothesised that IL-1 inhibition might improve fatigue in pSS patients; thus, we examined the effects and safety of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) on fatigue.
METHODS: Twenty-six pSS patients participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study. Patients were randomised to receive either anakinra or a placebo for four weeks. Fatigue was evaluated by a fatigue visual analogue scale and the Fatigue Severity Scale. The primary outcome measure was a group-wise comparison of the fatigue scores at week 4, adjusted for baseline values. Secondary outcome measures included evaluation of laboratory results and safety. The proportion of patients in each group who experienced a 50% reduction in fatigue was regarded as a post-hoc outcome. All outcomes were measured at week 4.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in fatigue scores at week 4 compared to baseline after treatment with anakinra. However, six out of 12 patients on anakinra versus one out of 13 patients on the placebo reported a 50% reduction in fatigue VAS (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.03). There were two serious adverse events in each group.
CONCLUSIONS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of IL-1 blockade did not find a significant reduction in fatigue in pSS in its primary endpoint. A 50% reduction in fatigue was analysed post-hoc, and significantly more patients on the active drug than on placebo reached this endpoint. Although not supported by the primary endpoint, this may indicate that IL-1 inhibition influences fatigue in patients with pSS.

A population PK model was developed using NONMEM with 2,535 samples from 344 Japanese RA patients in two clinical trials. The exposure-response relationship was characterized using a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) logistic regression model, with time-varying actual trough concentrations and ACR20 responder rates over 6¬†months in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial for stable methotrexate. Abatacept exposure was well characterized using a linear, two-compartment model, in which body weight and the empirically calculated glomerular filtration rate were significant covariates for clearance. The ACR20 response model was developed by examining the quasi-likelihood information criterion, and the cumulative logit in the final model was specified by the log-transformed trough concentration. The predicted ACR20 responder rate was consistent with the actual values in the clinical trial and this model revealed trough concentrations higher than the recommended body weight-tiered dose are unlikely to result in substantial increases in clinical efficacy. Considering that ACR20 is a longitudinal binary variable and the response to RA treatment is delayed, the GEE model was useful for predicting the probability of an ACR20 response. In conclusion, the same dosing regimen as non-Japanese patients is recommended because a body weight-tiered dosing regimen achieves similar exposures across the wide range of body weight."
9263388,,10.3899/jrheum.111068,"Background/Purpose: Disability and impairments in role functioning are common obstacles for many patients with RA. A combination of diseaserelated and psychosocial factors may contribute to limitations in functioning. The purpose of this research was to examine a model describing the interrelations among disease burden, mood disturbance, and disability as determinants of role limitations in patients with RA. It was expected that disease burden would be negatively associated with role functioning directly and/or indirectly through the potential mediators of mood disturbance and disability. Methods: The data of 103 participants were drawn from baseline of a randomized comparative efficacy trial of psychosocial interventions for RA. In the hypothesized model, disease burden (total joint score and disease activity items from the Rapid Assessment of Disease Activity in Rheumatology) directly and indirectly predicted role functioning (physical role and social functioning from the Short Form-36) through negative mood (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) and disability (large-limb gross movement and small-limb fine movement from the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index). EQS 6.1 was used to evaluate the structural model. Data screening revealed a violation of multivariate normality, therefore, the ML robust test statistics, which correct for non-normal data, are reported. Results: The hypothesized model provided a good fit of the data, CFI =.975; S-B 2 29) = 38.12, p =.120; RMSEA =.056. However, the Wald test indicated removal of the path from mood disturbance to disability (beta = +.08, p =.421). As such, along with theoretical plausibility, this path was removed. The fit of this more parsimonious model was similar, CFI =.976; S-B 2 30)=38.60, p=.135; RMSEA=.053, and the final model is depicted in Figure 1. Greater disease burden predicted mood disturbance and higher levels of disability. In turn, mood disturbance and disability related to lower levels of role functioning. Partial support was found for the hypothesis that mood disturbance and disability mediate the relation between disease burden and role functioning. Specifically, as a sole predictor, the effect of disease burden on role functioning was significant (beta=-.68, p"

Methods: Adopting randomized controlled principle, the 63 RA patients enrolled were assigned to two groups, the 32 patients in the EA group were treated with EA, and the 31 patients in the simple needling (SN) group treated with simple needling. According to the integral-local combining method, the acupoints were selected mainly from yang-meridian and local Ashi points (pain-point). EA or SN was applied every other day, 10 times as a course, and each patient received a total of 3 courses of treatment. Results: Blood and synovial levels of TNF-alpha and VEGF were reduced significantly after treatment in both groups. The lowering (absolute value and difference value) of TNF-alpha as well as the absolute value of VEGF, either in blood or in synovia, were similar in the two groups (P>0.05); but the lowering of VEGF after treatment was more significant in the EA group than that in the SN group (P<0.05).

9263399,,10.5152/tjr.2011.020,"Objectives: We compared the inpatient rehabilitation model (IRM), provided by the physiatrist, physical therapist, rehabilitation nurse and clinical psychologist, with the home exercise model (HEM), provided by the physiatrist for the rehabilitation of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Patients and methods: One hundred and twenty eligible adult patients [60 RA (mean age 51.8+11.7) and 60 AS (mean age 39.7+10.4)] requiring rehabilitation treatment who had not received physical therapy (PT) in the past two years were included in this study. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups IRM or HEM. The primary outcome was one of the following measures from baseline to 15 months: Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28) and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores for patients with RA and scores of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) for patients with AS. Outcome assessors were blinded. General estimated marginal means of multivariate comparisons were performed for both ""within-subjects"" and ""between-subjects"" for statistical analyses. Results: Mean disease duration of patients with chronic RA and AS were 8.5+6.4 (median 7) and 8.7+7.8 (median 6) years, respectively. Changes of DAS28 and HAQ scores were better in the IRM group than the HEM group. While most of the patients with RA used combined disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, none of the patients used anti-tumor necrosis factor agents for disease control. BASFI and BASDAI score improvements were not different in both groups. Inpatient rheumatologic rehabilitation programs improved physical function and disease activity in patients with RA and AS. However, statistically significant changes were detected in the DAS28 and HAQ scores of RA patients. Conclusion: Since patients' functioning is a central aspect of the rheumatic diseases, and remission is rare for these diagnoses, rheumatologic rehabilitation programs should be applied to all of these patients. Inpatient care was useful for patients with RA in contrast to patients with AS. It might be related to more resting periods in inpatient care as opposed to the usual care or ineffective drug therapy for continuing disease process in patients with AS.  2011 Turkish League Against Rheumatism.

To assess the risk of total malignancy and nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving certolizumab and golimumab through a metaanalysis of data from randomized control trials (RCT). Methods. We systematically reviewed the literature up to May 2011 in Medline databases, as well as abstracts from the 2009 and 2010 annual meetings of the European League Against Rheumatism and the American College of Rheumatology. Mantel-Haenszel method was used to determine a common odds ratio (OR). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by chi-square Q test. We selected only RCT including more than 30 RA subjects randomly assigned to an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or a nonbiological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) control group. Results. The literature search identified 793 articles; 6 (2 with certolizumab and 4 with golimumab) were selected for metaanalysis. A total of 2710 patients received at least 1 dose of certolizumab or golimumab. For anti-TNF-treated patients, 18 cancers (excluding NMSC) and 9 NMSC were observed versus 4 cases of total malignancy and 3 NMSC in control groups. Metaanalysis revealed a pooled OR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.39-2.85) for risk of total malignancy and 0.69 (95% CI 0.23-2.11) for risk of NMSC with certolizumab and golimumab versus DMARD. Heterogeneity was not significant. Conclusion. Metaanalysis of RCT of golimumab and certolizumab did not find an increased risk of total malignancy and NMSC.

Methods:This was a 12 week, phase III, multicentric, open label, prospective, comparative study, conducted in the outpatient setup. Sixty eligible subjects, who gave written informed consent, were treated with either CMT 2000 mg/day for four weeks followed by 3000 mg/day for further eight weeks or NA 500 mg/day for four weeks followed by 1000 mg/day for further eight weeks, as per the allocation procedure. DAS 28 (Disease activity score in 28 joints), which was the primary efficacy parameter and the global evaluation of efficacy and tolerability, which were the secondary efficacy parameter were assessed [by the investigator (IGA) and patient (PGA)] during each visit. The global assessment of gastric tolerability was done using the Global Overall Symptom scale at each follow up visit. Results: Both drugs showed similar efficacy in terms of reduction in tender and swollen joint counts, severity of pain and improvement in general health. Reductions in DAS 28 score during the treatment period in both groups indicated a symptomatic improvement. Improvement in IGA and PGA scores from baseline were noted in both groups, but this was statistically insignificant. The safety profile in both drugs did not differ significantly throughout the study. Conclusion:We conclude that CMT has an efficacy and safety profile comparable to that of Naproxen and could be considered as an alternative choice in the symptomatic treatment of RA."

We recruited 100 patients awaiting THR and randomly allocated them to either the piriformis-sparing approach or the standard posterior approach. Pre- and post-operative care programmes and rehabilitation regimes were identical for both groups. Observers were blinded to the allocation throughout; patients were blinded until the two-week assessment. Follow-up was at six weeks, three months, one year and two years. In all 11 patients died or were lost to follow-up. There was no significant difference between groups for any of the functional outcomes. However, for patients in the piriformis-sparing group there was a trend towards a better six-minute walk test at two weeks and greater patient satisfaction at six weeks. The acetabular components were less anteverted (p = 0.005) and had a lower mean inclination angle (p = 0.02) in the piriformis-sparing group. However, in both groups the mean component positions were within Lewinnek's safe zone. Surgeons perceived the piriformis-sparing approach to be significantly more difficult than the standard approach (p = 0.03), particularly in obese patients. In conclusion, performing THR through a shorter incision involving sparing piriformis is more difficult and only provides short-term benefits compared with the standard posterior approach."

9263426,,10.2147/btt.s31145,"Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients maintaining clinical remission after adalimumab (ADA) dose reduction compared with patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Secondary purposes include evaluating the proportion of PsA patients who achieve remission, the duration of remission after ADA dose reduction, time to relapse, psoriasis course, and the frequency of adverse events at the end of follow-up. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective, follow-up, case-control study of 76 consecutive patients (35 females, 41 males; mean age 46 + 10.2 years) who met the classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis and required anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy according to Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis recommendations. The 76 patients were compared with 55 patients (40 females, 15 males; mean age 50 + 11.6 years) who satisfied the American College of Rheumatology criteria for rheumatoid arthritis and received the same treatment. Case patients and controls were recruited from January 2008 to December 2010. At baseline, PsA patients and controls received 40 mg of ADA every other week, usually with methotrexate (10 to 20 mg/weekly). In the presence of clinical remission, ADA dose was reduced to 40 mg every 4 weeks in both groups. Results: Fifty-three of the 76 (69.7%) PsA patients and 17 of the 55 (30.9%) rheumatoid arthritis (P < 0.019) controls achieved remission after a mean time of 5.1 + 1.2 and 6.3 + 1.6 months, respectively (P = nonsignificant). After halving the dose of ADA, 47 of the 53 (88.6%) PsA patients and three of the 17 (17.6%) controls maintained remission (P = 0.016) over a mean follow-up period of 28.9 + 8.4 and 24.2 + 6.4 months, respectively. No significant changes in Psoriatic Arthritis Severity Index scores were observed. The mean time to relapse was 8.3 + 3.4 months in six case patients and 7.2 + 4.2 in 14 controls (P = not significant). No serious adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusion: Clinical remission is possible in a high percentage of patients with early PsA receiving ADA. Such remission is maintained in a high proportion of subjects after ADA dose halving, with relevant advantages in terms of patient compliance, drug-exposure risk, and economic burden.  2012 Cantini et al."

Recent meta-analyses suggest that both active and native vitamin D can help maintain lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD), particularly in patients receiving lower-dose glucocorticoid therapy. Recent randomized, controlled clinical trials have shown that oral bisphosphonates are superior to vitamin D in maintaining BMD and should be continued for as long as a person receives glucocorticoid treatment. Similar to the oral bisphosphonates, intravenous ibandronate has been shown to preserve BMD and also to significantly reduce vertebral fracture risk. Increasing evidence supports a role for parathyroid hormone to prevent or treat GIOP as well. Despite effective therapies, many at-risk patients fail to receive treatment for GIOP, and even among those who initiate treatment, half discontinue within 1 to 2 years. New approaches to evidence implementation are being tested to improve the quality of osteoporosis care and decrease fracture risk among long-term glucocorticoid users.

9263434,,10.1007/s10067-012-1985-5,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise on cardiac autonomic function as measured by short-term heart rate variability (HRV) in females suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Females with confirmed RA were randomly assigned to an exercise group (RAE) and a sedentary group (RAC). RAE was required to train under supervision two to three times per week, for 3 months. Three techniques (time domain, frequency domain and Poincar√© plot analyses) were used to measure HRV at baseline and study completion. At baseline, RAC (n = 18) had a significantly higher variability compared to RAE (n = 19) for most HRV indicators. At study completion, the variables showing significant changes (p = 0.01 to 0.05) favoured RAE in all instances. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to assess changes within groups from start to end. RAE showed significant improvement for most of the standing variables, including measurements of combined autonomic influence, e.g. SDRR (p = 0.002) and variables indicating only vagal influence, e.g. pNN50 (p = 0.014). RAC mostly deteriorated with emphasis on variables measuring vagal influence (RMSSD, pNN50, SD1 and HF (ms(2)). Study results indicated that 12 weeks of exercise intervention had a positive effect on cardiac autonomic function as measured by short-term HRV, in females with RA. Several of the standing variables indicated improved vagal influence on the heart rate. Exercise can thus potentially be used as an instrument to improve cardiac health in a patient group known for increased cardiac morbidity."

After 20 sessions of physiotherapy, Group 1 had a significant gain in HS and PS (p < 0.05) in addition to the improvement of functionality as assessed by HAQ (p = 0.016). For Group 2, no difference was found between the variables analysed (p > 0.05). The strengthening exercises for individuals with RA hand deformity are beneficial to improve handgrip and pinch strengths as well as functionality."

METHODS: we have examined the effect of ibandronate on bone microarchitecture with peripheral high-resolution quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) in a randomized placebo-controlled trial among 148 women with osteopenia. Patients received either oral 150¬†mg monthly ibandronate or placebo over 24¬†months. Bone microarchitecture was assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 24¬†months, using HR-pQCT at the distal radius and tibia; areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was measured with DXA at the spine, hip, and radius.
RESULTS: at 12¬†months, there was no significant difference in trabecular bone volume at the radius (the primary end point) between women on ibandronate (10.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.5%) and placebo (10.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.9%), p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.25. There was no significant difference in other radius trabecular and cortical microarchitecture parameters at 12 and 24¬†months. In contrast, at the tibia, cortical vBMD in the ibandronate group was significantly greater than in the placebo group at 6, 12, and 24¬†months, with better cortical thickness at 6, 12, and 24¬†months. With ibandronate, aBMD was significantly increased at the hip and spine at 12 and 24¬†months but at the radius was significantly superior to placebo only at 24¬†months. Most of the adverse events related to ibandronate were expected with bisphosphonate use, and none of them were serious.
CONCLUSION: we conclude that 12¬†months of treatment with ibandronate in women with osteopenia did not affect trabecular bone microarchitecture, but improved cortical vBMD at the tibia at 12 and 24¬†months, and preserved cortical thickness at the tibia."

The work investigated whether the observed decline in peripheral neutrophil and platelet counts after tocilizumab administration can be directly explained by tocilizumab IL-6R blockade, thus demonstrating the mechanism of tocilizumab action. Tocilizumab and total sIL-6R concentrations, neutrophil and platelet counts from 4 phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis patients were available. Patients received 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab intravenous infusions every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses. A population approach was applied to describe the relationship between tocilizumab and sIL-6R concentrations and subsequent changes in neutrophil and platelet counts. Following tocilizumab administration, concentrations of total sIL-6R increased, while neutrophil and platelet counts declined. These changes were transient, with counts returning to their respective baseline levels soon after tocilizumab is eliminated from the body. Tocilizumab concentrations were described by a two compartment model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination. The quasi-steady-state target-mediated drug disposition model described tocilizumab relationships to total sIL-6R, which allowed computation of unobserved unbound sIL-6R concentrations. The neutrophil counts were described as a direct function of unbound sIL-6R concentrations. The platelet counts were described by the transit-compartment life-span model with inhibition of production that depended on the unbound sIL-6R concentrations. Thus, the observed changes in sIL-6R, neutrophil, and platelet data are consistent with the tocilizumab mechanism of action and can be fully explained by tocilizumab binding to sIL-6R and mIL-6R."

Visual feedback is a relatively new tool that enables the patient to visualize as well as monitor a real-time change of their disease activity parameters as well as the patient's reported outcome measures. Integrating electronic data recording in the standard rheumatology clinical practice made visual feedback possible. To evaluate the feasibility of using the visual feedback in patients with early inflammatory arthritis (EA) and how ubiquitous computing technology can improve the patients' compliance and adherence to therapy, this was a double-blind randomized controlled study, which included 111 patients diagnosed to have EA according to the new ACR/EULAR criteria. All patients received disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) therapy and monitored regularly over the period of 1 year. By the 6th month of treatment, the patients were randomly allocated to an active group (55 patients) to whom the visual feedback (visualization of charts showing the progression of disease activity parameters) was added to their management protocol, and a control group (56 patients) who continued their standard management protocols. The patients were monitored for another 6-months period. All the patient's disease activity parameters, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), medications, scores of falls, and cardiovascular risks were recorded electronically. Primary outcome was the change in the patients' adherence to their medications, disease activity score (DAS-28), and PROMs: pain score, patient global assessment, functional disability, and quality of life. Secondary outcome was the answers to a questionnaire completed by every patient in both the active group and control group (using Visual Analogue Scale) by the end of 1 year of management, to rate from the patient's perspective the impact of the management protocol, whether using the standard or visual feedback approach, on them and their disease. The visual feedback provided a significant greater reduction in disease activity parameters as well as improvement of the patients' adherence to antirheumatic therapy (P < 0.01). Also stopping the DMARDs therapy because of intolerance was significantly less in the active group. Concerns about the future was significantly less in the active group whereas inability to coup with daily life and disease stress were significantly more among the control group. The improvement of disease activity parameters was associated with improvement in functional disability and quality of life scores. Mean changes in disease parameters showed no significant differences at 3-6 months of therapy but differences were statistically significant at 12-months follow-up (P < 0.01). Medication compliance was significantly correlated with changes in all measured disease parameters. By recording and monitoring disease activity parameters electronically and incorporating the visual feedback approach into clinical practice, a new experience can be created. Visual feedback enabled the patients to see how they are doing regarding their disease activity and helps to optimize their adherence to their treatment. Visual feedback had a positive and significant impact on the disease activity control."

Tear turnover rate, evaporation and osmolarity along with meibomian gland dropout and lipid layer interferometric patterns were assessed in the right eyes of 12 patients with dry eye associated with cGVHD, 12 age-matched patients with SS and 12 age-sex matched subjects with MGD. In cGVHD, the decrease in tear turnover rate was similar (P=0.33), but the number of non-functioning meibomian glands was significantly higher (P<0.01) than in SS. Tear evaporation rate in cGVHD dry eye was found to be similar to that in MGD (P=0.36) and significantly higher than in SS (P<0.01). The lipid layer was most unstable in cGVHD compared with other groups. There was no variation in tear volume across all groups. Although statistical significance was not detected, the mean tear osmolarity (333.51¬±14.67mOsm/L) was highest in cGVHD.

Patients and methods: The study (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01793259) enrolled 120 patients requiring initiation or intensification of MTX therapy for RA. Patients were randomized to receive the test drug, a prefilled pen (Metex PEN/Metoject PEN), or the reference drug, a prefilled syringe (Metex/Metoject), at doses of 15, 17.5, or 20 mg MTX SC once a week for 3 weeks. This was followed by receipt of the reference drug (prefilled syringe) or the test drug (prefilled pen) in a crossover design, with each patient serving as his/her own control. Questionnaires regarding patient preference, the Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ), and diaries regarding local tolerability were used to document outcomes. Results: Overall patient preference for the MTX prefilled pen was 75% (P<0.0001). In a six-item questionnaire, 73% to 76% of the patients preferred the prefilled pen in relation to use, acceptability, and satisfaction, and 67% of the patients confirmed that it did not take much effort to overcome SC self-injection with the pen. The SIAQ showed no clinical differences, in any domain scores, between both devices. Overall patient attitude towards self-injection at baseline was positive, as was patient experience with both devices during the study. As well, 92% of physicians and study nurses indicated that they would recommend the MTX prefilled pen to patients for future MTX treatment. The formulations were generally well tolerated. Conclusion: SC self-injection of MTX with a prefilled pen was generally preferred, by patients with RA, over a prefilled syringe with regard to use, acceptability, and satisfaction. This is supported by the strong appreciation of their attending study nurses and physicians, for its convenience.  2014 Demary et al."

Most studies are in patients with polyarticular JIA and data in enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) is limited. We did a survey in routine clinical care about use of MTX in ERA. Methods: Clinical records of all patients with ERA seen first time between 2007 and 2010 and having a minimum follow up of 6 months were reviewed. The baseline characteristic and response at 6 and 12 months was assessed. Swollen joint count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC) and ESR was assessed. Non response was defined as <30% response in these parameters. Results: There were 113 patients (107 males). Among these all had arthritis, 70 patients had history of inflammatory back pain, 72 had enthesitis, 14 had uveitis, 4 had dactylitis and 7 had positive family history. Forty one received MTX in addition to NSAIDs and Intraarticular steroids. The patients who received MTX had higher disease activity. MTX was stopped at 3 month in one patient due to transaminitis and 2 in addition had received Sulphasalazine so thus of the 44 patients 41 are included analysis. Conclusion: Methotrexate is used more often in patients with high disease activity. It is safe. However its benefit over NSAID alone needs to be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

To follow children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who had completed at least 6 months of the TRial of Early Aggressive Therapy (TREAT) clinical study for an additional 2 years, describing safety of early aggressive treatment, disease activity, function, and duration of clinical inactive disease (CID) during followup. Methods. Children were treated as per provider's discretion. Physician, patient/parent, and laboratory measures of disease status as well as safety information were collected at clinic visits every 3 months for up to 2 years. Results. Forty-eight children were followed for a mean of 28 months (range 12-42) beyond the end of the TREAT study. Half of patients were in CID for > 50% of their followup time. Overall, 88% of patients achieved CID at > 1 study visit and 54% achieved clinical remission while taking medication. Six patients were in CID for the duration of the study, and, of those, 2 achieved a full year of clinical remission while not taking medication. Active disease was mild: mean physician's global assessment 2.4, active joint count 3.5, parent global evaluation 2.4, Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire 0.32, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 19 mm/h, and morning stiffness 23 min.

9263491,,10.1007/s40123-014-0025-8,"Aim: The main treatment for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), a major cause of dry eye, is eyelid warming. Lack of compliance is the main reason for treatment failure. This has led to the development of eyelid-warming devices that are safe, effective and convenient. To obtain robust evidence demonstrating their efficacy, the authors conducted a 3-arm randomized clinical study. Methods: The authors conducted a 3-month assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of patients from the Singapore National Eye Centre experiencing at least one of eight dry eye symptoms 'often' or 'all the time'. Patients who wore contact lenses, had an active infection or known diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction and rheumatoid arthritis were excluded from the study. MGD participants were randomly assigned to warm towel (n = 25), EyeGiene (Eyedetec Medical Inc., Danville, CA, USA) (n = 25) and Blephasteam (Spectrum Thea Pharmaceuticals LTD, Macclesfield, UK) (n = 25) treatments. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes included the proportions of participants with improved symptoms and changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), respectively. Other outcomes included tear break up time (TBUT), Schirmer test, corneal fluorescein dye staining and number of visibly occluded meibomian gland (MG) orifices. Results: The study population was 53.5 + 11.1 years old and predominantly Chinese. For severity of symptom after 3 months of treatment, 78.3% Blephasteam participants reported improvement compared to 45.5% warm towel participants (p = 0.023). The corresponding proportions for improvement in the frequency of symptoms were 82.6% and 50.0%, respectively (p = 0.020). The proportions of improvement of symptoms in EyeGiene patients were not significantly different from warm towel intervention. At 1 month of treatment, the crude odds ratio of improvement of severity of irritation for Blephasteam compared to control was 3.0 (95% CI 0.88-10.18). However, the odds ratio adjusted by age was 5.67 (1.30-24.66). The lid-warming treatments did not significantly change the TBUT, Schirmer test results or number of visibly occluded MGs in the study period. All treatment modalities did not worsen BCVA after 3 months. Conclusion: Blephasteam is more effective than warm towel for MGD treatment, with warm towel and EyeGiene being comparable effective. Older age might predict for treatment efficacy. All studied therapies were safe for visual acuity (VA) for 3 months of treatment."
9263509,,10.3899/jrheum.130664,"Objective. Patient assessments of disease activity (PtGA) and general health (GH) measured by visual analog scale (VAS) are widely used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) clinical practice and research. These require comprehension of the question's wording and translation of disease activity onto a written VAS, which is problematic for patients with limited health literacy (HL) or difficulty completing forms. This study's objective was to validate verbally administered versions of patient assessments and identify factors that might explain discrepancies between verbal and written measures. Methods.We enrolled patients with RA at the Denver Health rheumatology clinic (n = 300). Subjects were randomized to complete the traditional written PtGA and GH and one of the verbal assessments. Subjects provided a verbal numeric response after reading the question, having the question read to them in person, or hearing the question over the phone. Spearman and Lin correlations comparing written and verbal assessments were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explain any discrepancies. Results. The instruments administered verbally in-person showed good, but not excellent, correlation with traditional written VAS forms (Spearman coefficients 0.59 to 0.70; p < 0.001 for all correlations). Twenty-three percent of subjects were unable to complete 1 of the written VAS assessments without assistance. HL predicted missing written data and discrepancies between verbal and written assessments (p < 0.05 for all correlations). Conclusion. Providers should use verbal versions of PtGA and GH with caution while caring for patients unable to complete traditional written version. Limited HL is widely prevalent and a barrier to obtaining patient-oriented data. (First Release Dec 15 2013; J Rheumatol 2014;41:256-64; doi:10.3899/jrheum.130664).

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab, a fully human antiinterleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, administered with an intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) loading regimen versus placebo, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. In this phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, 52-week study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01359943), 221 patients with inadequate response to methotrexate were randomized (2: 2: 1) to secukinumab, IV loading 10 mg/kg at baseline, Weeks 2 and 4, then SC 150 mg every 4 weeks (n = 88); secukinumab SC loading 150 mg once weekly for 5 weeks, then every 4 weeks (n = 89); or a matching placebo (followed by secukinumab 150 mg every 4 weeks starting Week 16; n = 44). The primary endpoint was superior efficacy of pooled secukinumab versus placebo using American College of Rheumatology 20% response (ACR20) at Week 12. Results. The primary efficacy endpoint was not met: aCR20 response at Week 12 was 49.2% for pooled secukinumab versus 40.9% for placebo (p = 0.3559). These variables improved significantly with pooled secukinumab versus placebo at Week 12 (all p < 0.05): the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28), patient's and physician's global assessment of disease activity, patient's assessment of RA pain, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Results of continuous efficacy outcomes were similar between the IV and SC loading regimens. The most frequent adverse events were infections, with similar rates across secukinumab and placebo. Conclusion. Although the primary endpoint (ACR20) was not met, secukinumab demonstrated improved efficacy in reducing disease activity over placebo as measured by DAS28 and other secondary endpoints"

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of abaloparatide vs. baseline fracture risk, assessed using the FRAX tool. Material and Methods: baseline clinical risk factors (age, BMI, prior fracture, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, smoking and maternal history of hip fracture) were entered into country-specific FRAX models to calculate the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures with or without inclusion of femoral neck BMD. The interaction between probability of a major osteoporotic fracture and treatment efficacy was examined by a Poisson regression. Results: 821 women randomized to the placebo group and 824 women in abaloparatide were followed for up to 2 years. At baseline, the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures (with BMD) ranged from 2.3 to 57.5 %. Data suggest that treatment with abaloparatide was associated with a 69 % decrease in major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) compared to placebo treatment (95%CI: 38, 85 %). The risk of any clinical fracture (AF) decreased by 43 %; (95%CI: 9, 64 %). Hazard ratios for the effect of abaloparatide on the fracture outcome did not change significantly with increasing fracture probability (p>0.30 for MOF and p=0.11 for AF) (Figure). Similar results were noted for the interaction when FRAX probability was computed without inclusion of BMD. Conclusions: clinical data suggest that the investigational drug, Abaloparatide, may significantly decrease the risk of major osteoporotic fracture and any clinical fracture in postmenopausal women, irrespective of baseline fracture probability.

Among these, bisphosphonates (BPs), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) monoclonal (MAb) denosumab (DMAb) are the major osteoporosis agents. Several studies demonstrated that the effect of osteoporosis agents is evaluated by lumar or hip dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, private clinic commonly use the radial DXA. On the other hand, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is sometimes associated with osteoporosis but there is no established treatment approach. In addition, glucocorticoids (GCs) are often used in the treatment of RA and sometimes induce osteoporosis. The present study assessed the effect of DMAb on osteoporosis in patients divided into RA and RA + GC patients by radial DXA. Patients: the therapeutic effect of denosumab was assessed in female osteoporosis patients using radial dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (radial DXA) in three groups: those with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PO group), PO with rheumatoid arthritis (RA group), and PO with RA receiving glucocorticoids (RA + GC group). Methods: in total, 427 PO patients 60 years of age or older with a young adult mean value of <70 %, as determined by radial DXA, were treated with denosumab. The denosumab treatment group comprised a PO group (n = 205), RA group (n = 156), and RA + GC group (n = 66). The control group comprised a PO group (n = 44) and RA group (n = 33) who received oral bisphosphonate. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined by using radial DXA. The bone turnover marker type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (NTx) was also measured. Results and Conclusions: radial DXA revealed a significant increase in BMD in the denosumab treatment group but not in the bisphosphonate treatment group. The onset of an increase in BMD with denosumab was slower in the RA group than in those without RA. The effect of denosumab in preventing increased NTx levels was smaller in the RA and RA + GC groups than in the PO group. Adherence to denosumab treatment was statistically significantly greater than for bisphosphonate treatment. Copyright ¬© 2016, The Author(s)"

A random sample of patients >18 years old with a coded diagnosis of psoriasis and no diagnosis of PsA, rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis were identified from five GP surgeries in Yorkshire, UK. Patients were randomised 1: 1 to receive study information alone or with the educational leaflet, with an invitation to attend for a screening examination by a dermatologist and rheumatologist. Nine hundred thirty-two invitation packs were sent to recruit 191 (20.5%) participants. One hundred sixty-nine (88.5%) had current or previous psoriasis and 17 (10.1%) had previously undiagnosed PsA. The estimated prevalence of PsA was 18.1% (95% CI: 16.2, 20.1%). The response rate was lower than expected and was not significantly higher when patients received the educational leaflet (22.8 vs 18.3%, p = 0.08). Response rates varied by practice (14.7 to 30.6%). However, deprivation scores for each practice revealed a significant increase in response with the leaflet for deprivation decile of 3 (p < 0.001) but no significant differences in the other practices. An educational leaflet about PsA improves attendance for screening in primary care, but only in those practices with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Copyright ¬© 2016, The Author(s)"

9263574,,10.4314/tjpr.v16i2.29,"Purpose: to prepare and characterize transdermal films of diclofenac diethanolamine as a safer and more effective alternative than the sustained release (SR) tablet equivalent for prolonged relief from pain and inflammation in arthritis. Methods: transdermal films of diclofenac were prepared using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and polyvinyl pyrrolidone K30, with turpentine oil and sesame oil as penetration enhancers. The films were characterized for physicochemical properties and for ex vivo permeation in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) for analgesic activities in arthritic patients. Results: the transdermal films were uniform in weight and thickness, flat, with high drug content (94.40 +/- 1.04 to 98.62 +/- 1.08%) and with high folding endurance (149 +/- 9.09 to 192 +/- 10.12). Drug permeation through excised rat abdominal skin was prolonged. Films containing penetration enhancers showed higher ex vivo drug permeation than those without the enhancer; furthermore, drug permeation increased with increase in the concentration of enhancer. The films were non-irritating to the skin. In RCT, F3 (containing turpentine oil, 1%v/w) decreased the pain score from 9.87 +/- 1.14 to 4.94 +/- 0.78 units, compared with the SR tablet (once daily) which decreased pain from 9.59 +/- 0.42 to 6.49 +/- 1.20 units, 48 h post-administration. Turpentine oil showed better permeation enhancement than sesame oil in the transdermal films. Conclusion: transdermal films of diclofenac, formulated with permeation enhancers, may have greater therapeutic advantages over conventional oral tablets in terms of prolonged release and improvement of patient compliance in rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods: a systematic Medline search identified RA randomized trials of FDA approved drugs/biologics through to end of 2012 of at least 12 weeks duration, that reported baseline and on-trial CRP and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) data. Weighted by trial size and by within-trial comparison errors-in-variable regression modelled the reduction in CRP as a function of HAQ improvement. The lower 95% prediction line determined the minimum CRP difference, the surrogate threshold effect (STE), below which there would be no predicted HAQ benefit. Surrogacy metrics, the surrogate threshold effect proportion (STEP) and R-square-trial was used to evaluate CRP as a surrogate endpoint for physical function on the Biomarker-Surrogate Evaluation Schema (BSES). Results: in 46 qualifying trials of 57 comparisons of all approved pharmacologic classes model, the STE of CRP for a HAQ benefit was a difference of 14 mg/L, the STEP was 67% and R-square-trial 24%. In this model CRP was 'Excellent' on Study Design, 'Good' on Target Outcome, 'Fair' on Statistical Evaluation, and' Excellent' on Pharmacologic/Clinical Generalisability, and CRP was a grade C- biomarker. In the DMARD only class model the STE and R-square-trial were better at 13 mg/L 46%, and CRP was C+ biomarker. However, neither model qualified CRP as a valid surrogate endpoint in RA trials. Conclusions: we provide the first STE for CRP and the first biomarker-surrogate evaluation of a rheumatic disease biomarker using surrogate metrics in FDA approved drugs/biologics. Many published RCTs in RA do not report on-trial CRP or HAQ. CRP performs less well than established biomarkers (diastolic blood pressure is Grade B+ surrogate endpoint)"

Patients achieving LDA (DAS28-ESR <3.2) at week 24 were randomized to receive ETN50+MTX+/-other nbDMARDs or PBO+MTX+/-nbDMARDs for 28 weeks (Period 2 [P2]). Dose adjustments of nbDMARDs and corticosteroids were allowed throughweek 16 of P1 but not thereafter except in cases of adverse events (AEs). The primary endpoint: LDA at week 52 without flare (ie, DAS28- ESR >/=3.2 + DAS28-ESRworsening of >/=0.6); secondary endpoints: dAS28 and SDAI LDA and remission, ACR50 response, and HAQ-DI total score improvement >0.22 and total score =0.5 in P2.

9263592,,10.1017/s0007114515002718,"Aim: to examine the relationships between plasma levels of the omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and remission and algorithm-based DMARD use in recent onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: a randomised controlled trial of high dose versus low dose fish oil in recent onset RA (median disease duration 16 weeks) generated a range of plasma concentrations of EPA and DHA, the main omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil1. Plasma EPA and DHA values from both groups were treated as a single cohort and COX proportional hazards models were used to examine relationships between the fatty acids and various outcome measures. Results: plasma EPA was related to time to ACR remission (Hazard Ratio 1.12  p = 0.017). Thus, a one unit increase in EPA was associated with a 12% increase in the instantaneous risk of ACR remission. Adjustment for smoking, anti-CCP and shared epitope status did not change the HR. Plasma EPA, adjusted for the same baseline variables, was negatively related to time to DMARD failure (HR = 0.85 [95%CI 0.72- 0.99] p = 0.047). The Hazard Ratios for the relationships between DHA and time to ACR remission or DMARD failure were similar to those for EPA, but not statistically significant. There was no relationship between EPA or DHA and time to DAS28 remission. Conclusions: an RCT of fish oil in these patients with recent onset RA demonstrated increased ACR remission and decreased DMARD failure in the fish oil group1. This follow-up analysis is consistent with the results of the RCT in demonstrating a relationship between plasma levels of the biomarker, EPA, and the same outcome measures"

The objective of this study was to describe infliximab pharmacokinetics using routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data and to develop a model allowing the prediction of infliximab concentrations using only one concentration measurement, dose and time since last perfusion. Material and methods: this retrospective study included 218 patients treated with infliximab followed between 2005 and 2012 in Tours university hospital, as described previously . Infliximab concentrations associated with positive antibodies toward infliximab were removed from the analysis. Infliximab pharmacokinetics was described using a population one-compartment model. Patients were randomly assigned in learning (2/3) and validation (1/3) subgroups. Population analysis was used to estimate PK parameters and to predict infliximab concentrations using (i) continuous time for each patient (PK), (ii) time since last dose for each patient (TLD), and (iii) TLD for each concentration (TLD-C). Model parameters were estimated using only learning subset. Models were developed and fully validated according to standard requirements. Prediction performances of TLD and TLD-C strategies were assessed by comparing PK parameter estimates and concentration predictions to the ones obtained with PK for both learning and validation subsets. Results: a total of 870 infliximab concentration measurements were available among the 218 patients. Patients were treated for rheumatoid arthritis (n = 18), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 91), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 79), and psoriatic arthritis (n = 30). PK, TLD and TLD-C strategies described the data satisfactorily and provided accurate estimations of parameters. Covariate model was unchanged between strategies. Body weight, sex and underlying disease were found to significantly influence infliximab pharmacokinetics. Population volume of distribution (Vd), clearance (CL) and elimination half-life (T1/2) were 5.3 L, 0.236 L/day and 15.6 days, respectively. Parameter estimates and concentration predictions were comparable for TLD vs. PK and TLD-C vs. PK. Discussion/Conclusion: accurate individual pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and concentration predictions may be drawn from only one infliximab concentration measurement. The TLD-C approach is suitable to optimize dosing regimen of infliximab in routine therapeutic drug monitoring"

Objective: This open-label extension (OLE) study (NCT01873443) compared the efficacy and safety of CT-P10 in patients with RA who received CT-P10 from the outset (i.e., from the start of the RCT and also in the OLE; 'maintenance group') with those who received RTX during the RCT and switched to CT-P10 during the OLE ('switch group'). Methods: Patients who completed the RCT were recruited. Based on the Disease Activity Score using 28 joints (DAS28) and predefined safety criteria, patients could receive up to two courses of CT-P10 during the OLE. Efficacy [DAS28 and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response], safety and immunogenicity were assessed. Results: Eighty-seven patients were enrolled; 58 and 29 had previously received CT-P10 or RTX, respectively, in the RCT. Of these, 38 (65.5%) and 20 (69.0%) were treated with CT-P10 in the OLE and therefore comprised the maintenance and switch groups, respectively. The mean change in DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) from baseline (week 0 of RCT) at week 24 of the first OLE treatment course in the maintenance and switch groups was -2.7 and -2.4, respectively. The proportion of patients with good/moderate EULAR responses was also comparable between groups. Antidrug antibodies were detected in 13.2 and 15.0% of patients in the maintenance and switch groups, respectively, at week 24 of the first OLE course. CT-P10 treatment was well-tolerated when administered for up to 2 years or after switching from RTX. Conclusion: In this study population, comparable efficacy and safety profiles were observed in patients who switched from RTX to CT-P10 and those maintained on CT-P10 throughout treatment.

Eligible patients fulfilled the following criteria: 18 to 80 years of age; clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, low back pain, or joint/muscle pain; chronic non-malignant pain of moderate to severe intensity (Box-Scale-11 [BS-11] pain score >= 4), not adequately controlled with non-opioid analgesics and requiring an opioid for adequate analgesia; and no prior history of opioid treatment. Patients started with a 5 mug/h buprenorphine patch and were titrated as necessary to a maximum of 40 mug/h over a 6-week period to achieve optimal pain control. Patients continued treatment with the titrated dose for 11 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in BS-11 pain scores. Other endpoints included patients' sleep quality and quality of life as assessed by the 8-item Global Sleep Quality Assessment Scale (GSQA) questionnaire and the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire-3 Level version (EQ-5D-3 L), respectively. Tolerability was assessed by collecting adverse events. // RESULTS: A total of 114 eligible patients were included in the analysis. The mean BS-11 score at baseline was 6.2 (SD 1.6). Following initiation of TDB, there was a statistically significant improvement in BS-11 score from baseline to visit 3 (least squares [LS] mean change: -2.27 [95% CI -2.66 to -1.87]), which was maintained till the end of the study (visit 7) (LS mean change: -2.64 [95% -3.05 to -2.23]) (p < 0.0001 for both). The proportion of patients who rated sleep quality as 'good' increased from 14.0% at baseline to 26.9% at visit 6. By visit 6, the mean EQ VAS score increased by 7.7 units (SD 17.9). There were also significant improvements in patients' levels of functioning for all EQ-5D-3 L dimensions from baseline at visit 6 (p < 0.05 for all).

In the Danish PRO-system, AmbuFlex, PRO data is used as the basis for outpatient follow-up instead of conventional follow-up with prescheduled appointments in the clinic. The patients' self-reported PRO data are used by clinicians as decision aid to support whether a patient needs contact to the clinic or not. Based on experiences from AmbuFlex, the Danish government and regions, who run the public hospitals, have decided on a national strategy for implementation of PRO. The aim is to describe experiences with large scale implementation of PRO in outpatient follow-up. Method: The AmbuFlex concept includes three generic elements: PRO data collection, PRObased decision algorithm, and PRO-based graphical overview. Experiences will be described with respect to these elements. Furthermore, experiences with evaluating the value of PRO will be described. Results: By January 2017, AmbuFlex is used by approximately 19,000 patients within 18 different patient groups in Denmark. In outpatients with epilepsy and sleep apnoea, 48 and 57%, respectively, of the incoming PRO responses were handled without further contact to the patient than the PRO assessment. A randomised study among outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis has found that PRObased tele-health follow-up achieved similar disease control as conventional outpatient follow-up. Clinicians as well as patients reported high satisfaction with the system. Conclusion: The use of PRO in outpatient follow-up is feasible and may be recommended as the basis for outpatient follow-up in several patient groups with chronic and malignant diseases."

The neurogenic inflammatory mechanism plays an important role in the inflammatory process of RA, and patho-logical changes in neural tissues in RA have also been noted. We aim to investigate treatment of the nervous system to relieve joint pain and inflammation in RA. Nerve mobilization, a nervous system-specific therapeutic exercise, was applied on RA patients to determine the effect of nerve mobilization on joint inflammation. Twelve RA patients were recruited from the community and were randomised into an experimental and a control group. In the experimental group, the subjects were taught a set of nerve mobilization exercises while the subjects in the control group were taught a set of gentle joint mobilization exercises. Both groups were in-structed to practice the exercises daily. After a 4-week period, their RA pain scale (RAPS) and pain scores were examined, as well as the C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Subjects in the experimental group showed improvements in RAPS and pain scores after 4 weeks of nerve mobilization exercises, while CRP and ESR values remained unaffected.

RESULTS: aCR20 response rates at week 24 for the secukinumab 150¬†mg and 75¬†mg groups were not statistically superior to placebo. None of the secondary endpoints was met for either secukinumab dose. Although not statistically significant, compared with placebo, numerically greater differences in least squares mean changes from baseline in HAQ-DI score and numerically higher ACR50 response rates were observed at week 24 in both secukinumab treatment groups. No new or unexpected adverse events were observed in this study compared with the large secukinumab safety database across psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other RA studies.
CONCLUSIONS: given that other second-line therapies have demonstrated efficacy in RA patients who failed to respond to TNF-Œ± inhibitors, these findings may suggest that interleukin-17A inhibition with secukinumab does not provide additional benefit to these patients. This study further confirms the well-characterized safety profile of secukinumab."

People who have RA have reduced levels of physical activity due to these symptoms. Interventions targeting physical activity behaviour in this population have had limited efficacy. This paper describes a protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a theory-based intervention delivered in a community setting designed to promote physical activity in people who have RA. The aim of the pilot study is to assess the impact of the intervention on moderate-intensity physical activity in people with RA. The objectives are to obtain reliable estimates regarding recruitment rates; participant retention, protocol adherence and generate potential effect size estimates to inform sample size calculations for a main trial on physical activity participation. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a selected sample of participants to explore their experiences. Participants will be recruited from direct referrals from the rheumatology clinics in a public hospital. Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be randomised into a 6¬†week physical activity intervention (four sessions delivered over a 6-week period by a trained physiotherapist) or a control group (physical activity information leaflet). Results of the pilot study will provide data to determine if a larger RCT is feasible. Qualitative data will inform intervention design and delivery. The findings will be disseminated to health professionals, in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations."

Tocilizumab, anti-inflammatory drug, is a humanised monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-6 signalling and is licensed in the UK for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The main objectives of this study are to test whether IL-6 contributes to the pathogenesis of depression and to examine potential mechanisms by which IL-6 affects mood and cognition. A secondary objective is to compare depressed participants with and without evidence of low-grade systemic inflammation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: this is a proof-of-concept, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Approximately 50 participants with International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of depression who have evidence of low-grade inflammation, defined as serum high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) level >=3mg/L, will receive either a single intravenous infusion of tocilizumab or normal saline. Blood samples, behavioural and cognitive measures will be collected at baseline and after infusion around day 7, 14 and 28. The primary outcome is somatic symptoms score around day 14 postinfusion. In addition, approximately, 50 depressed participants without low-grade inflammation (serum hs-CRP level <3mg/L) will complete the same baseline assessments as the randomised cohort. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: the study has been approved by the South Central-Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (REC) (Reference: 18/SC/0118). Study findings will be published in peer-review journals. Findings will be also disseminated by conference/departmental presentations and by social and traditional media. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: iSRCTN16942542; Pre-results.

The primary endpoint of this study was the reduction of arterial stiffness in RA patients without traditional cardiovascular risk factors or previous comorbidities, measured by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) through the enalapril intervention. The secondary endpoints were the enalapril influence on carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), carotid artery distensibility (cDistensibility), Young's incremental elastic modulus (Einc)]. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-three patients were enrolled in a clinical, randomized, closed-label trial. The subjects were randomly assigned into two groups: One receiving 5 mg of enalapril (27) or placebo (26), both twice a day. The drug was acquired at Victory Enterprises. The placebo was kindly provided by the Universidad de Guadalajara (UdeG), as well as the blinding into two groups: A and B. Enalapril and placebo were packed into bottles without labeling. Clinical assessment included a structured questionnaire to gather demographic and clinical variables as well as determination of CAVI, cfPWV, cIMT, carotid artery distensibility and Einc. The whole set of evaluations were analyzed at the baseline and at the end of 12 weeks of intervention. Result(s): The CAVI measurement at baseline was 7.1 +/- 1.4 and increased up to 7.5 +/- 1.2 at the end of 12 weeks. Meanwhile, the enalapril group was as follows: 7.4 +/- 1.2 and at the of intervention, reduced to 7.1 +/- 0.9. A reduction in delta CAVI of 0.21 in the enalapril intervention group was found. In contrast, an increase of 0.39 was observed in the placebo group. The delta CAVI reduction was not influenced by age or peripheral systolic blood pressure (pSBP). Discussion(s): Enalapril seems to be effective in CAVI reduction in RA patients. The effect of enalapril intervention on arterial stiffness translated to the clinical context might be interpreted as a reduction of 6.4 years of arterial aging.

We investigated the magnitude of placebo responses at 3 months and the potential factors influencing these outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) clinical trials., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials of pharmacological agents for RA identified from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. The primary placebo outcome was American College of Rheumatology 20% response rate (ACR20). Data were pooled with a random-effects model. Factors influencing placebo response were assessed by meta-regression analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed for studies conducted in non-Western countries only versus in Western countries (North America and/or Europe) only or both., RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 88 studies comprising 8406 patients receiving a placebo. The pooled estimate of placebo ACR20 was 29.0% (range 10.0-46.2; 95% confidence interval 27.2-30.9). Placebo ACR20 was negatively associated with trials in non-Western (Asian) countries and patient populations showing an inadequate response to biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the multivariable analysis, whereas it was positively associated with the year of publication. No background DMARD treatment was also a negative predictor (albeit statistically non-significant). In subgroup analyses of Western and multiregional studies, study population and publication year were significant factors., CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that study location, patient population, and a background DMARD treatment influence placebo ACR20. These along with placebo response temporal profiles have important implications for designing and interpreting RA clinical trials."

Upadacitinib was evaluated in Phase 3 studies as an oral extended-release (ER) formulation administered once daily. The purpose of this study was to develop a level A in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for upadacitinib ER formulation. The pharmacokinetics of four upadacitinib extended-release formulations with different in vitro release characteristics and an immediate-release capsule formulation of upadacitinib were evaluated in 20 healthy subjects in a single-dose, randomized, crossover study. In vivo pharmacokinetic data and in vitro dissolution data (USP Dissolution Apparatus 1; pH 6.8; 100 rpm) were used to establish a level A IVIVC. Three formulations were used to establish the IVIVC, and the fourth formulation was used for external validation. A non-linear IVIVC best described the relationship between upadacitinib in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption profiles. The absolute percent prediction errors (%PE) for upadacitinib Cmax and AUC were less than 10% for all three formulations used to establish the IVIVC, as well as for the %PE for the external validation formulation and the overall mean internal validation. Model was cross-validated using the leave-one-out approach; all evaluated cross-validation runs met the regulatory acceptance criteria. A level A IVIVC was successfully developed and validated for upadacitinib ER formulation, which meets the FDA and EMA regulatory validation criteria and can be used as surrogate for in vivo bioequivalence."

Methods: One hundred and twenty RA patients were randomly divided into control group and treatment group by random number table, n=60 in each group. Patients in both groups were treated with non-drug therapy referring to Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment of RA. Patients in control group were also treated with methotrexate tablets (10 mg/time, 1 time/week) and leflunomide tablets (10 mg/time and 1 time/day). Based on the treatment of control group, patients in treatment group were also given with oral and fumigation-washing administration of Juanbi decoction, 1dose/d and tid for oral, plus fumigation-washing, 2 times/d and 30 min/ time. Both groups were treated for 12 weeks. Scores of Chinese medicine clinical symptoms and levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factors (RF) and C reactive protein (CRP) levels were compared between two groups. Levels of MMP3 and TIMP1 levels in serum and synovial fluid were detected. Results: The total rate was 96. 67% in treatment group, significantly higher than 83.33% in control group (P<0.05). After 12 weeks' treatment, scores of Chinese medicine clinical symptoms in treatment group were significantly lower than those in control group (P<0.01). After treatment, ESR, RF, and CRP levels as well as MMP3 level in serum and synovial fluid in treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group, while TIMP1 level was significantly higher than that in control group, with statistical difference (P<0.01). Conclusion: Based on routine western medicine treatment, oral and fumigation-washing administration of Juanbi decoction for active stage RA with cold dampness syndrome could obviously improve clinical symptoms, decrease ESR, RF, and CRP levels, and elevate clinical efficacy. Its action mechanism may be associated with downregulation of MMP3 and upregulation of TIMP1 in serum and synovial fluid."

This affects physical as well as mental wellbeing and leads to severely reduced quality of life and reduced work capacity, thus yielding high individual as well as societal costs. As a complement to modern pharmacological treatment, lifestyle intervention should be evaluated as a treatment option. Scientific evidence exists for anti-inflammatory effects by single foods on RA, but no study exists where these foods have been combined to obtain maximum effect and thus offer a substantial improvement in patient life quality. The main goal of the randomized cross-over trial ADIRA (Anti-inflammatory Diet In Rheumatoid Arthritis) is to test the hypothesis that an anti-inflammatory diet intervention, compared to a regular diet, will decrease disease activity and improve quality of life in patients with stable established RA., METHODS: In total, 50 RA patients with moderate disease activity are randomized to receive initially either a portfolio diet based on several food items with suggested anti-inflammatory effects or a control diet during 2 x 10 weeks with 3 months wash-out between diets. Food bags are delivered weekly by a home food delivery chain and referred to as the fiber bag and the protein bag, respectively, to partially blind participants. Both groups continue with regular pharmacological treatment. Known food biomarkers will be analyzed to measure intervention compliance. Impact on disease severity (measured by DAS28, a composite score which predicts disability and progression of RA), risk markers for cardiovascular disease and quality of life are evaluated after each diet regimen. Metabolomics will be used to evaluate the potential to predict responders to dietary treatment. A health economic evaluation is also included., DISCUSSION: The nutritional status of patients with RA often is poor and many ask their physician for diet advice. No evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with RA exist because of the paucity of well-conducted sufficiently large diet intervention trials. ADIRA is an efficacy study and will provide evidence as to whether dietary treatment of RA can reduce disease activity and improve quality of life as well as reduce individual and societal costs., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Registration Number: NCT02941055 ."

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate injection site-related pain, safety, and tolerability of a 40 mg/0.4 mL formulation of adalimumab that had fewer excipients, a smaller volume, and a delivery presentation with a smaller gauge needle, versus the current 40 mg/0.8 mL formulation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)., METHODS: Two identically designed, phase 2, randomized, single-blind, two-period crossover studies were conducted in Belgium and the Czech Republic (Study 1) and Australia, Canada, and Germany (Study 2). In both studies, adults with RA [biologic-naive or current users of 40 mg/0.8 mL adalimumab with an average injection site-related pain rating >=3 cm on a visual analog scale (VAS; 0-10 cm)] were randomized to receive 40 mg/0.8 mL or 40 mg/0.4 mL adalimumab at visit 1. After 1-2 weeks (depending on patient medication schedule), patients received the other formulation at visit 2. A pain VAS [McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ-SF)] and the Draize scale were evaluated immediately after injection and 15 min postinjection. The primary endpoint was immediate pain after injection., RESULTS: 64 and 61 patients were randomized in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. Both studies found a clinically relevant and statistically significant lower immediate pain after injection for the 40 mg/0.4 mL versus the 40 mg/0.8 mL formulation. The mean difference on the VAS for the pooled data (-2.48 cm) was also clinically relevant. Most other endpoints in both studies favored the 40 mg/0.4 mL formulation, and its tolerability and safety profile were consistent with 40 mg/0.8 mL adalimumab., CONCLUSION: A 40 mg/0.4 mL adalimumab formulation was well tolerated and associated with less injection site-related pain than the 40 mg/0.8 mL adalimumab formulation., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01561313 and NCT01502423., FUNDING: AbbVie."

Presently, RA is mainly treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biological agents; however, they offer limited efficacy in some patients. Therefore, additional therapeutic strategies need to be developed. Yishen Tongbi decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation widely used to treat RA in China. However, currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use for the treatment of RA. Therefore, we aim to verify the efficacy of Yishen Tongbi decoction to treat RA by a noninferiority trial, and to provide a basis for its use with a full-scale clinical trial. Methods/design: one hundred eligible patients with RA will be randomized into two groups of 50 patients. One group will receive Yishen Tongbi decoction and placebo replacing methotrexate (MTX), while the other group will receive MTX and placebo replacing Yishen Tongbi decoction. Patient's whose visual analogue scale score for pain is greater than 40 mm will be administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as enteric-coated diclofenac sodium, 25 mg three times a day); administration of all medications will be recorded. The clinical indicators of patients and their disease activity will be assessed at baseline and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment initiation. The primary outcome of efficacy will be the proportion of patients who demonstrate a favourable response based on their Clinical Disease Activity Index score at 24 weeks after treatment. All adverse events will be reported. Discussion: traditional Chinese medicine theory and modern western medicine research have identified the efficacy of Yishen Tongbi decoction to treat RA. Previous clinical observation and efficacy trials of Yishen Tongbi decoction in animal models for the treatment of RA has demonstrated significant effect. Because of the potential benefits of Yishen Tongbi decoction in the treatment of patients with RA, we designed this double-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial; the results and conclusions of the trail will be published after the completion of the study.

The clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease has been demonstrated in four pivotal, randomized, double-blind trials (CLASSIC-I, GAIN, CHARM, and CLASSIC-II) that included a total of >1400 patients.  In the CLASSIC-I trial, adalimumab was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of remission in patients who had not previously received anti-TNF therapy.  Adalimumab was also more effective than placebo for induction of remission in the GAIN study in patients who had either lost responsiveness or developed intolerance to infliximab.  The CHARM trial showed that, among patients who responded to open-label adalimumab induction, maintenance therapy with adalimumab 40mg weekly or every other week for up to 1 year was associated with significantly greater remission rates than placebo at weeks 26 and 56. In addition, significantly more adalimumab than placebo recipients achieved corticosteroid-free remission and had complete fistula closure.  In CLASSIC-II, an extension of the CLASSIC-I trial, patients who were in remission after a short course of adalimumab and were randomized to receive up to 1 year's treatment with adalimumab 40mg weekly or every other week were significantly more likely to remain in remission than those randomized to receive placebo.

9736579,,10.1097/brs.0000000000001994,"Background: Traditionally, it has been common to apply external fixation using a collar after cervical laminoplasty for the purpose of resting the wound. However, some reports have been made claiming that use of a collar for a long period may induce such problems as muscle atrophy and joint contracture, and increase risks of malalignment and axial pain, and that, therefore, postoperative fixation may be omitted. However, these reports were all based on retrospective studies, and controversy remains as to the benefit of postoperative use of a collar. We investigated the effect of collar-aided fixation on prognosis following laminoplasty for cervical myelopathy in this randomized controlled study. Method(s): This trial involved 90 patients (mean age, 72.7years; 62 males and 28 females) with cervical compressive myelopathy who had undergone double-door laminoplasty from June, 2009 to July, 2012. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, trauma or sever local kyphosis were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from each patient before research participation. Prior to their operations, we randomly assigned 45 patients to the collar-fixation (CF) group where each of them underwent external fixation using a Philadelphia collar for 2 weeks following their operations, and 45 to the no-collar (NC) group where they wore no collar (Figure). Finally, we successfully completed one-year follow-up for 74 patients (39 patients in the CF group and 35 patients in the NC group) and we assessed them using the JOA score, SF-36, a visual analog scale (VAS) of cervical pain, lordotic angle of C2 to 7, prior to the operations and one year after the operations, and perioperative complications (infection, epidural hematoma, C5 palsy). We used Student's t test and chi-squared test for statistical analysis and a P value of less than 0.05 considered to be significant. Result(s): JOA scores significantly improved in both groups (P = 0.002, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the recovery rate of JOA scores (P = 0.80). The loss of lordotic angle of the cervical spine after operation was 6.5degrees and 7.1degrees in the CF goup and the NC group, respectively (P = 0.82). VAS scores after operation were 2.9cm and 3.5cm, respectively (P = 0.68). SF-36 BP-domain was similar in both groups (P = 0.58). The Incidences of complication were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion(s): Previous retrospective studies showed better cervical range of motion for nocollar or shortened collar term after laminoplasty. However, there was no randomized controlled study before. Here we showed that patients exhibited good neurological symptoms and recovery of ADL with or without collar fixation. Furthermore, there might be potential disadvantages for collar fixation such as higher cost or skin discomfort.

Global burden of disease is extremely high due to HT. The Framingham study tells us that about 90% of people after the age of 65 years have a lifetime risk of developing HT. The aetiology of hypertension is various and complex, involving both genetic and behavioural factors. More and more people experience increased anger, anxiety and depression brought on by globalization, cultural changes, socioeconomic changes, and stress at the work place. Anger is a critical contributing factor in essential hypertension (EHT). In our research, we tried to correlate anger with EHT and to treat anger - and thus the level of hypertension - with homeopathic simillimum. Objective(s): To investigate the relationship between level of anger and level of hypertension. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of homeopathic treatment on anger - and thereby on blood pressure (BP) - in comparison with standard care treatment for hypertension. Method(s): 300 patients with EHT were screened, 172 of whom (108 men, 64 women) were enrolled after informed, voluntary consent. They were divided into two equal groups by simple randomisation. After thorough case-taking, all patients were advised regarding DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), life-style modification and antihypertensives, as per individual requirements. The STAXI-2 scale was applied to measure anger at the beginning and after six months'study period. One group was kept on placebo and the other on individualised homeopathic medicine. Regular follow-up was every two weeks. Data generated was analysed by SPSS v.21. Result(s): Except state anger and its components, all other variables of anger, as well as systolic and diastolic BP, were remarkably reduced (p < 0.001) by homeopathy. Also, 89% of patients in the homeopathy group experienced relief in the symptoms of co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, gastroesophageal reflux disorder and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Standard care with anti-hypertensives had little impact on anger or the general psychopathology of patients, and had no effect on co-morbidities. Conclusion(s): The patients treated with individualised homeopathic treatment showed statistically significant improvement in anger and hypertension, and also showed notable relief in the symptoms of co-morbidities."

The objective is to understand the efficacy, safety and mechanism of Biqi combined with methotrexate (MTX) in RA., Methods: We present a randomized, controlled pilot trial on Biqi combined with MTX against patients with active RA. Seventy patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Biqi + MTX or Leflunomide (LEF) + MTX for 24 weeks, and were assessed at baseline, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. Serum and urine samples were collected for metabolomics., Results: Overall, 81.2% patients in Biqi group achieved ACR20 at 24 weeks. No statistically significant differences were observed in primary or secondary outcomes between the two groups. A better safety profile was observed for Biqi with significantly fewer adverse effects reported (11.4%) compared to LEF group (40%, P < 0.05). Comparison between treatment responders and non-responders indicated a unique urine metabolic profile of enriched fatty acids and decreased acylcarnitines associated with Biqi responders, indicating a restored energy homeostasis in response to Biqi. The gene targets of these metabolites were significantly enriched in interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathways, implying that Biqi could ameliorate Th2-derived inflammatory response. Multivariate network analysis indicated that patient morning stiffness and SJC were key factors associated with metabolomics in Biqi-treated patients, whereas CRP was the main factor in LEF group. Therefore, Biqi and LEF likely work by influencing different patient clinical parameters., Conclusions: Our study suggests that Biqi capsule can be a promising alternative option in combination with MTX for RA treatment, and demonstrates the capability of using metabolomics to interrogate mechanism of action for traditional Chinese medicine.

There is considerable heterogeneity in management strategies and a lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. Consensus treatment plans (CTPs) are standardized treatment regimens that are derived based upon best available evidence and current treatment practices that are a way to enable comparative effectiveness studies to identify optimal therapy and are less costly to execute than randomized, double blind placebo controlled trials. The purpose of this project was to develop CTPs and response criteria for PFAPA., METHODS: The CARRA PFAPA Working Group is composed of pediatric rheumatologists, infectious disease specialists, allergists/immunologists and otolaryngologists. An extensive literature review was conducted followed by a survey to assess physician practice patterns. This was followed by virtual and in-person meetings between 2014 and 2018. Nominal group technique (NGT) was employed to develop CTPs, as well as inclusion criteria for entry into future treatment studies, and response criteria. Consensus required 80% agreement., RESULTS: The PFAPA working group developed CTPs resulting in 4 different treatment arms: 1. Antipyretic, 2. Abortive (corticosteroids), 3. Prophylaxis (colchicine or cimetidine) and 4. Surgical (tonsillectomy). Consensus was obtained among CARRA members for those defining patient characteristics who qualify for participation in the CTP PFAPA study., CONCLUSION: The goal is for the CTPs developed by our group to lead to future comparative effectiveness studies that will generate evidence-driven therapeutic guidelines for this periodic inflammatory disease."

The second purpose was to analyze the correlation between the domain values of NHP and the demographic and clinical parameters, functional efficiency, and mood., Patients and methods: The studies involved 212 patients with RA, divided into two groups: group I - 126 persons treated using csDMARDs, group II - 86 patients using csDMARDs in combination with bDMARDs. A diagnostic survey was used applying NHP for HRQoL, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). The 28-Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS-28) was calculated., Results: The patients with RA in both studied groups did not differ significantly in terms of all the NHP domains, values of HAQ and BDI. The DAS-28 value, the number of swollen joints, and the duration of morning stiffness were significantly smaller among patients from group II. However, in both groups, the majority of the analyzed components of NHP demonstrated significant correlations with values of HAQ and BDI and some of the domains of NHP - with DAS-28., Conclusion: The level of HRQoL, functional efficiency, and mood are comparable in patients treated conventionally and in combination with biological drugs. The HRQoL level shows correlation with the occurrence of depression symptoms, and the energy level, the sensation of pain, and physical abilities are covariates with daily activities. The intensity of the activity of RA as well as experiencing pain and the duration of morning stiffness is smaller among patients applying csDMARDs plus bDMARDs compared with patients treated only conventionally."

Early intervention with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate (MTX) and its combination regimen would provide obvious benefits to patients, healthcare systems and society. MTX and tripterygium glycosides tablets (TGTS) are most frequently prescribed medicines for RA, and the combination of them occurs frequently in anti-RA prescriptions. While the underlying combination mechanisms and the affected variation of drug blood level remain unclear. According to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for improvement, clinical evaluation following three treatment groups (i.e., MTX and TGTS mono- and combined groups) were carried out at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks in a randomized controlled clinical trial. To monitor the affected variation of drug blood level and perturbation of metabolites caused by MTX plus TGTS combined to treat active RA, the collected plasma samples were analyzed using RRLC-QqQ-MS and UHPLC-QE Orbitrap HRMS instruments. As a result, 39 metabolites including 7 MTX-related metabolites, 13 TGTS-related migratory ingredients and 19 characteristic endogenous metabolites, were quantitatively determined in plasma samples of RA patients after oral administration. The potential mechanism of MTX and TGTS combination were preliminarily elucidated on the aspect of clinical biochemical test indicators integrated with quantitative plasma pharmacochemistry and the pseudotargeted metabolomics."

The present study intends to evaluate whether a set of signs and symptoms of DED can distinguish: a) SS from other non-overlapping systemic diseases related to DED; b) primary and secondary SS., METHODS: 182 consecutive patients with DED were evaluated under five groups: SS, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Graves' orbitopathy (GO), diabetes mellitus (DM), glaucoma under treatment with benzalkonium chloride medications (BAK). Twenty-four healthy subjects were included as control group (CG). The evaluation consisted of Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Schirmer test (ST), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) and tear film break up time (TFBUT). Indeed, a subset of DED patients (n = 130), classified as SS1, SS2 and nonSS (NSS) by the American-European Criteria were compared. Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classified the individuals based on variables collected. The area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve evaluated the classification performance in both comparisons., RESULTS: Comparing SS with other diseases, QDA showed that the most important variable for classification was OSDI, followed by TFBUT and CFS. Combined, these variables were able to correctly classify 62.6% of subjects in their actual group. At the discretion of the area under the ROC curve, the group with better classification was the control (97.2%), followed by DM (95.5%) and SS (92.5%). DED tests were different among the NSS, SS1 and SS2 groups. The analysis revealed that the combined tests correctly classified 54.6% of the patients in their groups. The area under the ROC curve better classified NSS (79.5%), followed by SS2 (74.4%) and SS1 (69.4%)., CONCLUSIONS: Diseases that causes DED, and also SS1, SS2 and NSS are distinguishable conditions, however a single ocular tools was not able to detect the differences among the respective groups."

According to recent guidelines, tapering biological Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (bDMARDs) may be considered. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of long-term maintenance of tocilizumab (TCZ) treatment after the progressive tapering of infusions., Methods: We conducted an exploratory, prospective, single-center, open-label study, on RA patients with sustained remission of at least 3 months and treated with TCZ infusions every 4 weeks. The initial re-treatment interval was extended to 6 weeks for the first 3 months. Thereafter, the spacing between infusions was determined by the clinician. Successful long-term maintenance following the tapering of TCZ infusions was defined by patients still treated after two years by TCZ with a minimum dosing interval of 5 weeks., Results: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study. Eight out of thirteen were still treated by TCZ after two years. Successful long-term maintenance was possible in six patients, with four patients maintaining a re-treatment interval of 8-weeks or more. We observed 5 patients with TCZ withdrawal: one showing adverse drug reaction (neutropenia) and four with secondary failure. Patients achieving successful long-term maintenance with TCZ were significantly younger than those with secondary failure (p < 0.05). In addition, RA patients with positive rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies, experienced a significantly greater number of flares during our 2-year follow-up (p < 0.01)., Conclusions: A progressive tapering of TCZ infusions may be possible for many patients.

METHOD(S): OST measurements were performed in the metacarpophalangeal, proximal intraphalangeal and wrist joints of 168 RA patients and 114 controls. OST difference between the two groups was statistically examined and subsequently controlled for the effect of possible confounding factors. Diagnostic OST performance was tested by Receiver Operating Characteristics. Moreover, associations of OST with clinical and serological activity markers (patient group), joint ultrasound (US) (patient subgroup) and various anthropometric and epidemiologic parameters (patient and control group) were evaluated by Spearmann's test and a generalized linear statistical adjustment model. RESULT(S): OST was significantly higher in the RA group than in the control group, even after adjustment for confounding factors [1.89; 95%CI(0.709-3.070), padj=0.002)]. Taking US as a reference, Area Under the Curve (AUC) for all 1,251 joints simultaneously was 0.67 (95%CI=0.631- 0.709).

Methods: we used antigen and collagen-induced arthritis (ACIA) as a RA animal model. Sixteen male BALB/c models of ACIA mice were divided into two groups, the non-HBOT group as the control group and the HBOT group as the treatment group. Expression of HIF-1√é¬±, Th17 anti-cluster differentiation 196 (CD196), and Treg anti-interleukine 2 receptor √é¬≤-chain cells (IL-2R√é¬≤) in tissue from the left knee joint tissue were determined histologically. Oxidative stress and systemic inflammation were assessed by levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin 17a (IL-17a), C-reactive protein (CRP), and rheumatoid factor (RF) using the enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay. The degree of arthritis was assessed by clinical scoring of paw swelling and the diameter of paw swelling. Results: we found a significant decrease (p < 0.050) in the expression of HIF-1√é¬±, Th17 (CD196), IL-17a, RF levels, and the clinical scores and the diameter of paw swelling when comparing both groups. There was no significant decrease in the level of CRP in the treatment group compared to the control group. The expression of Treg (IL-2R√é¬≤) increased significantly (p < 0.050) and the level of SOD increased but not significantly (p > 0.050) in the treatment group compared to the control group. Conclusions: HBOT has effects on the polarization of Th17 to Treg through a decrease in expression of HIF-1√é¬± in mice with ACIA.

Multivariate regression models were adjusted with the propensity score, which was developed to mitigate differences in patients with and without platelet inhibition with acetylsalicylic acid. Propensity score-matching provides results close to the statistical quality of randomized controlled trials. Primary study-endpoint was of post-operative bleeding complication defined as acute bleeding leading to re-operation or hematoma leading to physician visit. Patient satisfaction, functional outcome measured with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, and onset of surgical site infection were also analyzed., RESULTS: Bleeding complications were observed in 56 procedures (8.8%). After propensity score-matching, there was no significant difference between the patients with and without acetylsalicylic acid treatment (p=0.997). History of thyroid disease (p=0.035) and of rheumatoid arthritis (p=0.026) were independent risk factors, whereas higher BMI might have a beneficial effect (p=0.006). Patients with post-operative bleeding had significantly impaired functional outcome as measured with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (p=0.026).

Despite usually well-tolerated, RTX may induce different types of adverse drug reactions, including exacerbation of vasculitis. Recently, RTX biosimilar CT-P10 has been approved in Europe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but no data are available about effectiveness and safety of CT-P10 in the treatment of MCV. In this multicenter open-label study, we analyzed the safety of CT-P10 in patients with MCV treated in first-line or after a shift by RTX originator. Fifty-one consecutive MCV patients (females/males 35/16, median age 68 years, median disease duration 42 months, 51% HCV positive) were included in the study between July and December 2018 and were treated with CT-P10 (group 1). Safety and effectiveness of CT-P10 were compared with a retrospective group (group 2) including 75 consecutive patients treated with RTX originator between July 2017 and July 2018. Thirty-six patients were treated with CT-P10 for the first time, while the other 15 switched from RTX originator. RTX was administrated with high or dosage schemes (375 mg/m2 four times a week apart/1000 mg twice one week apart or 250 mg/m2 twice one week apart). During a month period after the last infusion, 13/51 adverse events (AE) were observed in group 1 and 17/75 in group 2 (p not significant). Among them, 7/13 and 6/17 (in group 1 and 2, respectively) could be considered immune-mediated AE (p not significant). At univariate analysis patients with IM-AE were more frequently males (p = 0.04) and with a lower disease duration (p = 0.03), but both the parameters were not significant at logistic regression. About clinical response after 6 months by the end of the treatment, no differences were observed between patients treated with originator and CT-P10 regarding the response to the therapy. No differences were observed in safety and effectiveness between patients naive at RTX or switching from originator. Despite the higher prevalence of immune-mediated AE among patients treated with CT-P10 than originator, we have observed no significant differences between the 2 groups. The use of a low-dosage regimen is more common in group 1 than in group 2, representing a possible bias of the study, possibly influencing the appearance of AE. Considering the cost/efficacy ratio of biosimilars, their use could be helpful to treat a large number of MCV patients with an effectiveness and safety comparable to originator. Multicenter studies including a large number of patients and the new RTX biosimilars could be useful to fully elucidate the possible risk of immune-mediated adverse events with biosimilar drugs. Considering the cost/efficacy ratio of CT-P10, its use could help to treat a large number of MCV patients with an effectiveness and safety comparable to originator."

To check its comprehensibility, acceptability, and feasibility, alpha-testing was performed using the Decision Support Acceptability Scale (DSAS). Beta-testing was conducted to assess preliminary evidence of PDA efficacy using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) before and after PDA use. Readiness was evaluated using the Preparation for Decision Making Scale (PDMS)., RESULTS: The PDA included (1) a brief description of RA, (2) treatment information, and (3) a values clarification section. Alpha-testing revealed that most patients considered that the information was presented in a good or excellent way and it could help clarify their values and facilitate treatment decision making. Most rheumatologists agreed that the PDA was easy to understand, to use, and allowed them to reach a shared decision. Beta-testing showed that PDA significantly reduced overall patients' decisional conflict [33.2 (DE: 21.4) vs 24.6 (23.5); p < 0.001] and prepared the patient for decision making [PDMS: 67.5 (21.0)]., CONCLUSIONS: We developed a PDA for Spanish patients with moderate-to-severe RA that reduces patients' decisional conflict and increases their readiness for decision making. The use of this PDA in routine clinical practice may improve the quality of the decision-making process and the quality of the choices made."

Advances in the treatment of RA, such as biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), have provided better clinical outcomes, including the achievement of remission for patients with RA, but some patients cannot receive these treatments because of their side effects and high cost, and not all patients achieve remission. Although the efficacy of denosumab, which is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody with a high affinity for the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) ligand (RANKL), in the treatment of RA has been reported in clinical trials, the efficacy of denosumab in both preventing joint destruction and improving disease activity has not been evaluated in a real-world setting. Methods/design: this open-label, randomized, parallel-group study will compare the continued use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) alone with the combined use of csDMARDs and denosumab in patients whose RA is treated with csDMARDs. In total, 44 patients with RA will be randomly assigned to receive additional treatment with denosumab or to continue RA treatment without additional denosumab. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months. To analyze bone erosion and bone micro-architecture precisely, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) will be performed every 6 months. The primary endpoint is changes in the depth of bone erosion as measured by HR-pQCT from baseline to 6 months. Important secondary endpoints are the changes from baseline in the width and volume of bone erosion as measured by HR-pQCT and changes from baseline in the depth of bone erosion at 12 months. Changes in bone micro-architecture will also be analyzed as an exploratory endpoint. Discussion: the results of this study are expected to provide strong evidence regarding the usefulness of denosumab for the treatment of RA. Moreover, by using HR-pQCT, this study will also reveal the effect of denosumab not only on bone erosion but also on bone micro-architecture.

In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis [American College of Rheumatology (ACR) functional class I to III] who had failed to respond to previous treatment with >= 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), etanercept, alone or in combination with methotrexate, produced improvements in all components included in the ACR core set of disease activity measures. A dose-response effect was apparent with etanercept 0.25 to 16 mg/m2 twice weekly in a randomised, double-blind study in 180 patients. The mean number of swollen or tender joints at the end of the 12-week study decreased by > 50% in patients treated with etanercept 16 mg/m2 twice weekly and by < 25% in patients treated with placebo. In a 24-week multicentre, randomised double-blind study in 234 patients who were not allowed to use DMARDs, etanercept 10 or 25 mg twice weekly had a rapid onset of effect. Significantly more patients treated with etanercept 25 mg twice weekly than placebo experienced 20 (ACR 20), 50 (ACR 50) or 70% (ACR 70) improvement in ACR criteria after 3 and 6 months. Limited evidence suggests that the therapeutic effects of etanercept are maintained for up to 2 years. Etanercept 25 mg twice weekly produced significant improvement in patients receiving oral or subcutaneous methotrexate 10 to 25 mg/week in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with etanercept plus methotrexate (71%) than placebo plus methotrexate (27%) achieved the ACR 20 criteria after 6 months. Moreover, 39 and 15% of patients treated with etanercept plus methotrexate, but no placebo plus methotrexate recipients, had achieved the ACR 50 and ACR 70 criteria at this time. Etanercept 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly reduced disease activity in a preliminary, noncomparative study in 69 children aged >= 4 years with refractory juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Although the overall frequency of infections was similar in patients treated with etanercept or placebo, upper respiratory tract infections were more common in patients treated with etanercept (29%) than placebo (16%). Injection site reactions occurred more frequently in etanercept- than placebo-treated patients, but did not bias the results of any study. Conclusions: when etanercept is administered alone or in combination with methotrexate in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis, significant reductions in disease activity occur within 2 weeks and are sustained for at least 6 months. Thus, etanercept appears to be particularly well suited for use in patients who fail to respond to treatment with DMARDs"

This study compared the real-world effectiveness of TCZ monotherapy vs. TNFis plus MTX in US patients with RA., METHODS: TCZ-naive patients from the Corrona RA registry with prior exposure to >= 1 TNFi who initiated TCZ monotherapy or TNFi + MTX were included. Outcomes included mean change in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), achievement of low disease activity (LDA; CDAI <= 10), achievement of modified American College of Rheumatology (mACR) 20/50 responses, and mean change in modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ) at 6 months. Patients initiating TNFi + MTX were grouped by MTX dose (<= 10 mg; > 10 to <= 15 mg; > 15 to <= 20 mg; > 20 mg); outcomes in each group were compared with TCZ monotherapy using trimmed populations (excluding patients outside the propensity score distribution overlap)., RESULTS: Patients in all groups experienced improvement in CDAI at 6 months (mean change, - 6.9 to - 9.7), with no significant differences between the TCZ monotherapy and TNFi + MTX groups. Achievement of LDA and mACR responses at 6 months were comparable between the TCZ monotherapy and TNFi + MTX groups; overall, 26.8-38.0% of patients achieved LDA, 24.3-37.6% achieved mACR20 response and 13.2-20.8% achieved mACR50 response. The mean change in mHAQ at 6 months was - 0.1 in all groups., CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world population of US patients with RA who had prior TNFi exposure, there was no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of TCZ monotherapy compared with that of TNFi + MTX, regardless of MTX dose, at 6 months for improving RA disease activity., FUNDING: Corrona, LLC.

Pain and fatigue are key symptoms of RA and AS. Treatment presents a clinical challenge for several reasons, including the progressive nature of the diseases and the involvement of multiple pain mechanisms. Moreover, side effects of pain treatment pose an implicit risk. Currently, no well-controlled studies have investigated how medical cannabis affects pain and cognitive functions in RA and AS. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical cannabis in the treatment of persistent pain in patients with RA and AS with low disease activity. // METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled study of cannabidiol (CBD), followed by an open label add-on of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with collection of clinical data and biological materials in RA and AS patients treated in routine care. The oral treatment with CBD in the experimental group is compared with placebo in a control group for 12 weeks, followed by an observational 12-week period with an open label add-on of THC in the primary CBD non-responders. Disease characteristics, psychological parameters, demographics, comorbidities, lifestyle factors, blood samples and serious adverse events are collected at baseline, after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, and at a follow-up visit at 36 weeks. Data will be analysed in accordance with a predefined statistical analysis plan. // ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Danish Ethics Committee (S-20170217), the Danish Medicines Agency (S-2018010018) and the Danish Data Protection Agency approved the protocol.

All subjects received 740 mg (two tablets) talniflumate in a standard 2x2 cross-over model in a randomized order. For the genetic study, PK parameters of the reference drug were used. We used Illumina Human610Quad v1.0 DNA Analysis BeadChip for whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and whole genome genotyping data were processed by linear regression analysis for PK parameters. Whole genome analysis revealed 1498 significant SNPs (P < 0.0001) for Cmax, 65 significant SNPs (P < 0.0001) for T max, and 1491 significant SNPs (P < 0.0001) for AUC inf.

Methods: in a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, subjects with active PsA (joint involvement >=6 months; >=3 tender joints; >=3 swollen joints) were randomized to placebo (n=68), APR 20 mg BID (APR20; n=69), or APR 40 mg QD (APR40; n=67) and treated for 12 weeks. At week 12, placebo subjects were re-randomized to APR20 (P/APR20; n=20) or APR40 (P/APR40; n=20) until week 24. Stable doses of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and MTX (>=56 days before screening; dose range 1.5-30 mg/week) were allowed; randomization was stratified by baseline MTX use (MTX, n=115; no MTX, n=89). Last observation carried forward was used for missing data. The Breslow-Day statistic was used to test the null hypothesis of homogenous odds ratio (APR versus placebo) among subjects treated and not treated with MTX.

Thirty-two Sjogren's syndrome patients were randomly allocated in two groups receiving either Probiotics or placebo capsules twice a day for 5 weeks. The strains included in the probiotic capsule were Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacteriumbifidum.

Pain, erythema and angular cheilitis were also assessed at baseline and after 2, 4 and 5-week. In the probiotic group, there was a statistically significant reduction of the candidal load from baseline to the 5th week respectively.

Thirty-three of them were treated with conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), and 30 with biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). Patients underwent clinical and laboratory assessment and musculoskeletal ultrasound examination (MSUS) at baseline and at 6 months after initiation of therapy. We evaluated the rate of clinical and sonographic remission (defined as Power Doppler score (PD) = 0) and its correlation with BMI score., RESULTS: In the csDMARDs group, 60% of the normal weight patients reached DAS28 remission; 33.3% of the overweight; and 0% of the obese patients. In the bDMARDs group, the percentage of remission was as follows: 60% in the normal weight subgroup, 33.3% in the overweight; and 15.8% in the obese. Within the csDMARDs treatment group, two significant correlations were found: BMI score-DAS 28 at 6th month, rs = .372, p = .033; BMI score-DAS 28 categories, rs = .447, p = .014. Within the bDMARDs group, three significant correlations were identified: BMI score-PDUS at sixth month, rs = .506, p =.004; BMI score-DAS 28, rs = .511, p = .004; BMI score-DAS 28 categories, rs = .592, p = .001. Sonographic remission rates at 6 months were significantly higher in the normal BMI category in both treatment groups., CONCLUSION: BMI influences the treatment response, clinical disease activity indices and the rates of clinical and sonographic remission in patients with RA. Obesity and overweight are associated with lower remission rates regardless of the type of treatment.

However, knowledge about these components of physical fitness is limited in JIA patients diagnosed in the era of biologics. Objective(s): To compare muscle strength, total bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition in JIA patients diagnosed in the era of biologics with healthy controls; to compare muscle strength, total BMD and body composition between patient subsets; to examine associations between disease variables and muscle strength and total BMD in patients. Method(s): Sixty patients (50 girls) with persistent oligo JIA and polyarticular disease (extended oligoarthritis and polyarticular RF +/-), ages 10- 16 years, and 60 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Isokinetic quadriceps and hamstrings muscle strength (Cybex) and isometric hand grip strength (Baseline dynamometer) were measured bilaterally. Total BMD and body composition were measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry. Current pain, pain and fatigue during previous week, pubertal status, blood values and physical activity (PA) levels (accelerometry) were assessed in all participants. In patients, disease activity and functional disability were evaluated by validated tools. Result(s): Biologic drugs were used by 42 % of the patients. Patients had lower muscle strength bilaterally compared with controls in almost all variables tested. Results for the dominant side are shown in Table 1. Total body BMD and total body BMD z-scores were lower in patients compared to controls (Table 1). Total fat mass and fat mass percentage were comparable between patients and controls, while there was a tendency for patients to have lower lean mass compared to controls, p=0.06. Muscle strength, total BMD and body composition were comparable between patient subsets. In patients, higher muscle strength was associated with higher age, male sex, higher BMI and higher vigorous PA levels. Higher BMD was associated with higher total lean mass, higher age and female sex. No disease related variables were identified as determinants for muscle strength or BMD. Conclusion(s): Muscle strength and BMD are lower in JIA patients diagnosed in the biological era compared to controls. Body composition is more favorable in JIA patients than previously reported, with comparable fat mass and fat mass percentage between patients and controls."

We divided these patients into two subgroups: biologic-naive or TNF-IR. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with pertinent 95% confidence interval (95% CI)., RESULTS: Ten studies with a total of 2499 patients were included. For biologic-naive patients, ACR50 and ACR70 responses were significantly better with IL-17 inhibitors than placebo (RR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.23-2.38, P = 0.001 and RR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.10-6.25, P = 0.03, respectively), but ACR20 responses for IL-17 inhibitors were not statistically superior to placebo (RR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.94-1.91, P = 0.11). For TNF-IR, IL-17 inhibitors were effective in achieving ACR20 (RR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.40-2.00, P < 0.00001), ACR50 (RR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.43-2.63, P < 0.0001), and ACR70 (RR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.26-3.55, P = 0.005) compared to placebo. In the safety analysis, IL-17 inhibitors did not show increased risk of any AEs by comparing to placebo in both biologic-naive patients and TNF-IR., CONCLUSION: IL-17 inhibitors were effective in the treatment of RA without increased risk of AEs, whether for biologic-naive patients or TNF-IR. Key Points * In this meta-analysis comparing IL-17 inhibitors with placebo in 2499 rheumatoid arthritis patients, IL-17 inhibitors improved ACR50 and ACR70, but not ACR20, responses in biologic-naive patients. * IL-17 inhibitors improved ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses in tumor necrosis factor inhibitor inadequate responders."

We report a case of a MS patient with concurrent melanoma, treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor who remained clinically and radiologically stable. Case Report: A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS, after presenting with two spinal cord relapses. He was enrolled in a Phase III trial of ocrelizumab (OPERA II) and was randomized to the ocrelizumab treatment arm. He received a total of 5 doses of ocrelizumab over two and half years before he was found to have metastatic melanoma. He underwent melanoma resection with an eventual cholecystectomy and a partial liver resection over two years. He has been on experimental pembrolizumab (anti-programmed death 1 antibody) since the diagnosis of melanoma, without any concurrent MS disease-modifying treatment. Despite being off disease modifying therapy for four years, he has remained clinically and radiologically stable. Conclusion(s): We describe the case of a patient with known MS, who remains clinically and radiologically stable on pembrolizumab, which he is receiving for metastatic melanoma. It has known immune mediated adverse events and there have a been a few reports of flares in rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis and psoriasis. This is the first case report describing the effects of check point inhibitors in established MS. This case raises the possibility that check point modulation may have a therapeutic role in MS."
9736882,,10.1371/journal.pone.0223545,"In recent years, low dose naltrexone (LDN) has been used as an off-label therapy for several chronic diseases. Results from small laboratory and clinical studies indicate some beneficial effects of LDN in autoimmune diseases, but clinical research on LDN in rheumatic disease is limited. Using a pharmacoepidemiological approach, we wanted to test the hypothesis that starting LDN leads to reduced dispensing of medicines used in the treatment of rheumatic disease. We performed a controlled before-after study based on the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) to compare prescriptions to patients one year before and one year after starting LDN in 2013. The identified patients (n = 360) were stratified into three groups based on LDN exposure. Outcomes were differences in dispensing of medicines used in rheumatic disease. In persistent LDN users, there was a 13% relative reduction in cumulative defined daily doses (DDD) of all medicines examined corresponding to -73.3 DDD per patient (95% CI -120,2 to -26.4, p = 0.003), and 23% reduction of analgesics (-21.6 DDD (95% CI -35.5 to -7.6, p<0.009)). There was no significant DDD change in patients with lower LDN exposure. Persistent LDN users had significantly reduced DDDs of NSAID and opioids, and a lower proportion of users of DMARDs (-6.7 percentage points, 95% CI -12.3 to-1.0, p = 0.028), TNF-alpha antagonists and opioids. There was a decrease in the number of NSAID users among patients with the least LDN exposure. Important limitations are that prescription data are proxies for clinical effects and that a control group unexposed to LDN is lacking. The results support the hypothesis that persistent use of LDN reduces the need for medication used in the treatment of rheumatic and seropositive arthritis. Randomised clinical trials on LDN in rheumatic disease are warranted."

This study included 105 RA patients. For all patients, we recorded the presence of erosions on radiographs, the presence of subcutaneous nodules (SCN), the 28-tender joint count (TJC), 28-swollen joint count (SJC) scores, the visual analogue scale (VAS), physicians' global assessments (PhGA), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the rheumatoid factor (RF). The disease activity index (DAS28) and BMI were calculated and current treatment was recorded. Patients were divided into two groups: group I: BMI 25. Group I included 32 (30.5%) patients, whereas group II included 73 (69.5%) patients. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding each of the following: SJC (p=0.006), erosions (p=0.006), DAS28 (p=0.016) and PhGA (p=0.007).

However, little is known whether the diseases influence pneumococcal vaccine response. This study aimed to investigate antibody response and functionality of antibodies following immunization with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in RA patients or pSS patients without disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD), compared to patients with RA treated with DMARD or to healthy controls., Methods: Sixty RA patients (50 without DMARD and 10 with MTX), 15 patients with pSS and 49 controls received one dose of PCV13. Serotype-specific antibody concentrations for pneumococcal polysaccharides 6B and 23F and functionality of antibodies (23F) were determined in serum taken before and 4-6 weeks after vaccination using ELISA and opsonophagocytic activity assay (OPA), respectively. Proportions of individuals with positive antibody response (i.e. >= 2-fold increase from prevaccination concentrations; antibody response ratio; ARR >= 2), percentage of individuals reaching putative protective antibody level (i.e. >=1.3 mug/mL) for both serotypes, and difference in OPA were calculated., Results: After vaccination, antibody concentrations for both serotypes increased in RA without DMARD (p < 0.001), pSS (p <= 0.05 and < 0.01) and controls (p < 0.001). Antibody responses to 6B and 23F were comparable in RA without DMARD (64% and 74%), pSS (67% and 53%) and controls (65% and 67%), but lower in the small group RA with MTX (both 20%, p < 0.01). Similarly, significant increases of patients reaching protective antibody levels were seen in RA without DMARD (p <= 0.001) and controls (p < 0.001). After vaccination, OPA increased significantly in controls, RA and pSS without DMARD (p < 0.001 to 0.03), but not in RA with MTX., Conclusions: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is immunogenic in RA and pSS patients without DMARD and in line with previous studies we support the recommendation that vaccination of RA patients should be performed before the initiation of MTX., Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02240888.

Implantable bioelectronic devices targeting the inflammatory reflex reduce TNF production and inflammation in preclinical models of inflammatory disease, and in patients with RA and Crohn's disease. Here, we assessed the effect of applying a vibrotactile device to the cymba concha of the external ear on inflammatory responses in healthy subjects, as well as its effect on disease activity in RA patients., Methods: Six healthy subjects received vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha, and TNF production was analyzed at different time points post-stimulation. In a separate study, nineteen healthy subjects were enrolled in a randomized cross-over study, and effects of vibrotactile treatment at either the cymba concha or gastrocnemius on cytokine levels were assessed. In addition, the clinical efficacy of vibrotactile treatment on disease activity in RA was assessed in nine patients with RA in a prospective interventional study., Results: Vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha reduced TNF levels, and the suppressive effect persisted up to 24 h. In the cross-over study with 19 healthy subjects, vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha but not at the gastrocnemius significantly reduced TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 levels compared to pre-treatment baseline (TNF p < 0.05, IL-6 p < 0.01, IL-1beta p < 0.001). In healthy subjects, vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha inhibited TNF by 80%, IL-6 by 73%, and IL-1beta by 50% as compared to pre-treatment baseline levels. In RA patients, a significant decrease in DAS28-CRP scores was observed two days post-vibrotactile stimulation at the cymba concha (DAS28-CRP score pre-treatment = 4.19 +/- 0.33 vs post-treatment = 3.12 +/- 0.25, p < 0.05). Disease activity remained significantly reduced 7 days following vibrotactile treatment (DAS28-CRP score 7 days post-treatment = 2.79 +/- 0.21, p < 0.01). In addition, a persistent improvement in visual analogue scale scores, a patient derived measure of global health assessment, was observed in RA patients following vibrotactile treatment., Conclusion: Application of a vibrotactile device to the cymba concha inhibits peripheral blood production of TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in healthy subjects, and attenuates systemic inflammatory responses in RA patients., Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01569789 and NCT00859859.

If treatment fails, patients cycle to another TNFi (cycling) or switch to a targeted therapy with a different mode of action (MOA; switching). The study aimed to examine prescribing patterns and reasons for current RA treatment practice in Europe (EU5: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK) and Japan., METHODS: Data were collected from the Adelphi Disease Specific Programme TM (DSP; Q1-Q2 2017). Rheumatologists seeing >= 10 (EU5) and >= 5 (Japan) patients with RA a month completed Patient Record Forms. Patients >= 18 years old, with RA diagnosis and complete RA-targeted therapy history were included. Patients were grouped based on first-line targeted therapy class, and on whether first-line targeted therapy was monotherapy (targeted therapy alone) or combination therapy (targeted therapy and csDMARD). Those patients receiving TNFi at first-line and with >= 1 targeted therapy were classified as TNFi cyclers or MOA switchers. Univariate analysis compared factors across groups. Patient demographics and characteristics compared across groups; physician reasoning for targeted therapy change; and time to discontinuation of targeted therapy., RESULTS: In EU5 and Japan, respectively, 1741 and 147 patients were included; at first-line, 80.8% and 64.6% received TNFi and 76.0% and 77.6% received combination therapy. Overall in EU5, more combination therapy than monotherapy patients reached maximum csDMARD dose before first-line targeted therapy (P < 0.05); disease severity was higher in patients initiating TNFi versus non-TNFi (P < 0.05). In Japan, trends were similar but not significant. The most common reason physicians gave for changing therapy following first-line targeted therapy was 'secondary lack of efficacy' (EU5: 46.2%; Japan: 53.8%). In EU5 and Japan, respectively, of 365 and 22 patients who received second-line targeted therapy, 52.1% and 54.5% were MOA switchers. In EU5, TNFi cyclers had longer time from diagnosis to second-line targeted therapy initiation than MOA switchers (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: TNFis were the most commonly prescribed targeted therapy at first-line. Between 10 and 20% of patients prescribed a TNFi as first-line targeted therapy did so without concomitant csDMARD. Almost half of patients cycled to another TNFi at second-line."

The drug was approved for use as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this paper was to review the studies on pharmacology, mode of action, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of baricitinib in patients with RA. Baricitinib provides an innovative approach to modulating the immune and inflammatory response in patients with RA, which is especially important in individuals who do not respond to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or standard biologic drugs (tumor necrosis factor inhibitors) or who lose response over time. Baricitinib therapy reduces symptoms of RA and improves the quality of life. Moreover, it has shown high efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and become another JAK inhibitor approved for RA treatment, providing a useful alternative option. RCTs have revealed a significant benefit of baricitinib over placebo, MTX, and adalimumab in terms of standard efficacy outcomes, especially the American College of Rheumatology ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates. Additionally, a clinically meaningful improvement in patient-reported outcomes, including the quality of life, compared with placebo has been reported. The safety profile seems acceptable, although some rare but potentially severe adverse events have been observed, such as serious infections, opportunistic infections (eg, herpes zoster), malignancies, and cardiac or hepatic disorders.

The data were sourced from the registry for beneficiaries, inpatient and ambulatory care claims, and Registry for Catastrophic Illness from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan between 1997 and 2011. Patients, who were newly diagnosed with RA between 1997 and 2010, were classified as the CHP group or non-CHP group depending on the presence of absence the adjunctive use of CHP following a diagnosis of RA. A total of 4,148 RA patients were in both the CHP and non-CHP groups after 1:1 matching. Patients in the CHP group had a significantly lower risk of IS compared to patients in the non-CHP group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.86). In the CHP group, patients who used CHP for more than 30 days had a lower risk of IS than their counterparts (aHR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40-0.91). Gui-Zhi-Shao-Yao-Zhi-Mu-Tang, Shu-Jin-Huo-Xie-Tang, and Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang might be associated with a lower risk of IS. Finally, the use of CHP in combination with WM was associated with a decreased risk of IS in patients with RA, especially among those who had used CHP for more than 30 days. A further randomized control trial is required to clarify the casual relationship between these results. Copyright ¬© 2020 Shen, Chiang and Hsiung."
9736912,,10.4103/ayu.ayu_65_18,"Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease caused by type III hypersensitivity reaction due to antigen antibody complexes which deposit at the joints resulting in arthritis. As per the concept of Ayurveda, it can be co-related with Amavata, the disease arising from deranged metabolism and Vata vitiation. Despite of advancement in diagnostic approach of RA, management of it remains challenge. Vatari Guggulu and Seetarama Vati are the formulations having analgesics properties due to their Ushna (metabolism enhancing) and Tikshna Guna (micro channel cleaning) and simultaneously possess anti-inflammatory properties., Aims and Objectives: To evaluate and compare the efficacy of Vatari Guggulu and Seetarama Vati in the management of Amavata w.s.r. to rheumatoid arthritis., Material and Methods: For the present study, 58 patients were selected and divided into two groups. Patients of group A and group B were given Vatari Guggulu and Seetarama Vati respectively with warm water after meal for one month. Before administration of trial drugs in both of groups' patients were given 4-6 grams of Triphala powder depending upon the Koshtha of the patient, on empty stomach early morning for the purpose of Koshtha Shuddhi (purgation) for 3 days. In addition to assess effect on signs and symptoms of Amavata, haematological investigation, biochemical investigation including quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP) and rheumatoid factor (RA factor) and routine urinary examination were carried out before and after treatment in all the registered patients. The effect of therapy was assessed on the basis of changes in score in comparison to end point score., Discussion: All the cardinal and associate complaints were statistically significant improved after the course of the trial drug. Most of the functional parameters had statistically significant improvement after treatment except left side foot pressure and DAS 28 scale in B group. Biochemical and hematological parameters were within normal limit before and after treatment. The difference of effect of trial drug on chief complaints was statistically insignificant. The difference of effect of trial drug on associate complaints was statistically insignificant. Difference of effect of trial drugs on ESR of both the groups was statistically insignificant. The difference of effect of trial drug on RA factor and CRP between groups was statistically significant. The difference of effect of trial drug on functional parameters between groups were statistically significant., Conclusion: The study revealed that, though both the trial drugs; Vatari Guggulu and Seetarama Vati are effective in the management of Amavata, but clinically Seetarama Vati is comparatively more effective than Vatari Guggulu in the management of Amavata.

A total of 176 consecutive rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept were included. The propensity score based on multiple baseline characteristic variables was calculated, and 41 of 86 patients treated without MTX (MTX(-)) and 41 of 90 patients treated with concomitant MTX (MTX(+)) were statistically extracted and analysed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated and compared between the two groups over a 52-week period., RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were statistically comparable. No significant differences were observed in the following clinical outcomes from baseline throughout the 52-week period: drug retention rate (MTX(-)/MTX(+) 79.1%/80.5%), mean change in disease activity score based on 28 joints (DAS28-CRP) from baseline (- 1.35/- 1.54), low disease activity rate (48.8%/43.9%), clinical remission rate (31.7%/36.6%), moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response rate (68.3%/68.3%), and good EULAR response rate (36.6%/41.1%) at 52 weeks., CONCLUSION: In rheumatoid arthritis patients with similar background characteristics undergoing abatacept treatment, concomitant MTX does not seem to affect clinical outcomes. Abatacept would be a suitable treatment option in daily clinical practice in patients with contraindications to MTX., KEY POINTS: * This is the first study to directly compare the clinical efficacy and safety of abatacept between patients with and without concomitant methotrexate (MTX) treatment in 'real-world' settings using the propensity score matching method. * There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes of abatacept between patients with and without concomitant MTX treatment. * We used data from a large Japanese multicentre registry for biologics in rheumatoid arthritis, thereby decreasing selection bias based on the personal preferences of physicians."

Adenosine acts via G-protein coupled receptors; ADORA1, ADORA2a, ADORA2b and ADORA3. We studied if baseline expression of whole blood adenosine receptors can predict response to MTX. RA patients [American College of Rheumatology/European-League-Against-Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 criteria], Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) naive with active disease [Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) > 3.2] were enrolled. Blood samples were collected at baseline (n = 100) and at 4 months after therapy (n = 50). Patients were treated with MTX monotherapy. Based on EULAR response, patients were categorized into three groups i.e. good, moderate and non-responders. Adenosine receptors gene expression (ADORA1, ADORA2a, ADORA2b and ADORA3) in whole-blood RNA was measured using real-time PCR. HPRT1 was used as housekeeping gene. Receptor expression at baseline was correlated with response to MTX. All values are expressed as median (interquartile range). Hundred patients [87% females; age 40 (18) years]; duration of disease 24 (24.75) months; DAS28 4.7 (1.25) were enrolled. Fifty-one were classified as good, 28 moderate and 21 as non-responders. No expression of ADORA1 and ADORA2b was detected. Significant difference was observed in the expression levels of ADORA3 between good vs non-responder (P = 0.03) and moderate vs non-responder (P = 0.002). On ROC curve analysis, ADORA3 with cut-off value of less than - 0.60 (DELTACt) predicted non-response to MTX treatment (AUC: 0.7, P = 0.006). ADORA3 mRNA levels in whole blood may serve as a biomarker of response to MTX."

However, cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first-line treatment in international guidelines on sleep. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis suffer from debilitating symptoms, such as fatigue and pain, which can also be linked to sleep disturbance. It remains to be determined whether cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia can be effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of the Sleep-RA trial is to investigate the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia on sleep and disease-related symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The primary objective is to compare the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia relative to usual care on changes in sleep efficiency from baseline to week 7 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The key secondary objectives are to compare the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia relative to usual care on changes in sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, insomnia, sleep quality, fatigue, impact of rheumatoid arthritis and depressive symptoms from baseline to week 26 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis., METHODS: The Sleep-RA trial is a randomised controlled trial with a two-group parallel design. Sixty patients with rheumatoid arthritis, insomnia and low-to-moderate disease activity will be allocated 1:1 to treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia or usual care. Patients in the intervention group will receive nurse-led, group-based cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia once a week for 6 weeks. Outcome assessments will be carried out at baseline, after treatment (week 7) and at follow-up (week 26)., DISCUSSION: Data on treatment of insomnia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are sparse. The Sleep-RA trial is the first randomised controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Because symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and insomnia have many similarities, we also find it relevant to investigate the secondary effects of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia on fatigue, impact of rheumatoid arthritis, depressive symptoms, pain, functional status, health-related quality of life and disease activity. If we find cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia to be effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis this will add weight to the argument that evidence-based non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia in rheumatological outpatient clinics is eligible in accordance with the existing international guidelines on sleep., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03766100.

Therefore, this study aimed to compare HRQoL among healthy, obese and chronically ill children., METHODS: This cross sectional study was conducted among 802 children (8-12 years) who were recruited via convenience sampling method. Participants were 98 healthy, 102 obese and 602 chronically ill children with six groups of chronic conditions including different types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic gastrointestinal, kidney, neurologic and respiratory diseases. HRQoL was assessed using the Iranian version of the PedsQL questionnaire and both reports including child self-report and parent proxy-report were obtained. To compare subscales and total scores of HRQoL among healthy, obese and six groups of chronically ill children, the general linear model was used., RESULTS: Mean self-reported HRQoL total scores were 73.7 +/- 13.3 and 74.6 +/- 11.8 in girls and boys respectively; based on the parents' reports, mean HRQoL total scores were 71.6 +/- 15.4 and 71.4 +/- 13.0 in girls and boys respectively. From the prespectives of both children and parents, HRQoL total score was significantly lower in obese girls compared to both healthy girls and girls with chronic gastrointestinal, kidney, neurologic and respiratory diseases. Considering both children's and parents' reports, HRQoL total score was significantly lower in obese boys compared to both healthy boys and boys with chronic respiratory diseases. In terms of subscales of HRQoL, the impairment of HRQoL in obese children, compared to their counterparts with other chronic diseases, was more common in social functioning and physical functioning subscales, specifically in girls., CONCLUSION: Obese children reported poorer HRQoL compared to their healthy counterparts, as well as their counterparts with chronic diseases. Current findings emphasize the important impact of childhood obesity on the perceived health of these children, particularly in the social dimension, underscoring thereby the designing, planning and implementation of health promotion programs for prevention and treatment of childhood obesity."

However, medication adherence remains suboptimal, as treatment regimens can be complex and difficult to continue long term. Many trials have been conducted to improve adherence to medication. Core domains, which are the outcomes of most relevance to patients and clinicians, are a pivotal component of any trial. These core domains should be measured consistently, so that all relevant trials can be combined in systematic reviews and meta-analyses to reach conclusions that are more valid. Failure to do this severely limits the potential for trial-based evidence to inform decisions on how to support medication adherence. The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) - Interventions for Medication Adherence study by the OMERACT-Adherence Group aims to develop a core domain set for interventions that aim to support medication adherence in rheumatology., METHODS/DESIGN: This OMERACT-Adherence study has five phases: (1) a systematic review to identify outcome domains that have been reported in interventions focused on supporting medication adherence in rheumatology; (2) semi-structured stakeholder interviews with patients and caregivers to determine their views on the core domains; (3) focus groups using the nominal group technique with patients and caregivers to identify and rank domains that are relevant to them, including the reasons for their choices; (4) an international three-round modified Delphi survey involving patients with diverse rheumatic conditions, caregivers, health professionals, researchers and other stakeholders to develop a preliminary core domain set; and (5) a stakeholder workshop with OMERACT members to review, vote on and reach a consensus on the core domain set for interventions to support medication adherence in rheumatology., DISCUSSION: Establishing a core domain set to be reported in all intervention studies undertaken to support patients with medication adherence will enhance the relevance and the impact of these results and improve the lives of people with rheumatic conditions."

Drug survival and long-term safety were primary outcomes. The secondary outcome was long-term effectiveness, assessed by disease activity measures., RESULTS: Overall, 491 patients were treated with CT-P13 (154 patients with RA [135 infliximab-naive; 19 switched from reference infliximab]; 337 patients with AS [219 infliximab-naive; 118 switched from reference infliximab]). Drug survival was similar in naive and switched patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 31.8% and 29.4% of patients with RA and AS, respectively; incidence was similar in naive and switched groups. Upper respiratory tract infection, influenza-like illness, and urticaria were the most common TEAEs. Overall, nine (1.8%) patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) deemed potentially drug-related; SAEs led to permanent CT-P13 discontinuation in five (1.0%) patients, including three with tuberculosis. Disease activity decreased over time., CONCLUSION: Up to 5 years of CT-P13 treatment was safe and effective in patients with RA and AS, based on drug survival, incidence of TEAEs, and disease activity.

The contribution of patient-reported components to the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) was termed DAS28-P and investigated as a predictor of response to biologic agents, mostly tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. We aimed to evaluate DAS28-P as a predictor of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response to abatacept in patients with RA., METHODS: The study population was a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort of Korean patients with RA, who were followed up for a nationwide post-marketing surveillance study of abatacept. Correlation of DAS28-P with DAS28, change of DAS28, and EULAR response groups were evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was used to predict good-to-moderate EULAR response to abatacept in the study population., RESULTS: A total of 341 patients were involved in the analysis stratified on the EULAR response criteria. Presence of comorbidities, previous exposure to biologic agents, baseline DAS28, three of its components (tender joint counts, global health visual analog scale, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and baseline DAS28-P were significantly associated with EULAR response to abatacept at 6 months. Stratified upon EULAR response, a group with good-to-moderate response had a higher baseline value and lower interval change for DAS28-P. Logistic regression analysis showed that a DAS28-P cut-off of > 0.44 was more positively associated with good-to-moderate EULAR response with abatacept treatment than naivety to biologic agents., CONCLUSIONS: The DAS28-P could be predictive of response to abatacept.

The goal of the current study was to examine the structural validity of the HAQ-DI in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) and to compare its performance with that in patients with RA. Methods: The HAQ-DI structural validity was first assessed in a sample of 100 scleroderma patients using confirmatory factor analysis. Second, the similarity of factor structures between SSc patients (n = 291) and RA patients (n = 278) was tested using a multigroup structural validity model to assure that comparison of scores between these two diagnostic groups is appropriate. Results: Results yielded a single-factor HAQ-DI score which favored the current scoring system of the HAQ-DI (model fit was CFI = 0.99 and RMSEA = 0.04). Moreover, even the most stringent model of multigroup structural validity affirmed the similarity between SSc and RA patients on the HAQ-DI (model fit was CFI = 0.99 and RMSEA = 0.04) nor was it different from a model without any demands on group similarity: CFI difference = 0.007; chi2 = 4.29, df = 26, p=0.99. Conclusion: The current results indicate that a single-factor HAQ-DI is appropriate for future clinical trials in scleroderma and, in addition, HAQ-DI scores among patients with SSc and early RA can be compared legitimately with one another. ¬© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

We assessed the relative efficacy and safety of once-daily administration of peficitinib (a JAK3-selective inhibitor) 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg in patients with active RA., METHODS: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to combine direct and indirect evidence from eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The literature search was performed up to May 2019 using MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register., RESULTS: Three RCTs involving 948 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were ten pairwise comparisons, including five direct comparisons and five interventions. The American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response rate was significantly higher in the peficitinib 150-mg group than in the placebo group (odds ratio (OR): 3.61; 95% credible interval (CrI): 2.35-5.57). Similarly, the ACR20 response rate was significantly higher in the peficitinib 100-mg group than in the placebo group (OR: 2.33, 95% CrI: 1.51-3.56). The peficitinib 50-mg group had a significantly higher ACR20 response rate than the placebo group. However, the ACR20 response rate was not significantly higher in the peficitinib 25-mg group than in the placebo group. The ranking probability based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated that peficitinib 150 mg was likely to achieve the best ACR20 response rate (SUCRA = 0.995), followed by peficitinib 100 mg (SUCRA = 0.696), peficitinib 50 mg (SUCRA = 0.558), peficitinib 25 mg (SUCRA = 0.153), and placebo (SUCRA = 0.098). The ACR50 and ACR70 response rates showed a similar distribution pattern to the ACR20 response rate. The difference in the number of patients with adverse events (AEs) among the intervention groups was not statistically significant., CONCLUSIONS: Peficitinib 50, 100, and 150 mg once daily was effective in treating active RA, without causing a significant risk for AEs."

The neurogenic inflammatory mechanism plays an important role in the inflammatory process of RA, and pathological changes in neural tissues in RA have also been noted. We aim to investigate treatment of the nervous system to relieve joint pain and inflammation in RA. Nerve mobilization, a nervous system-specific therapeutic exercise, was applied on RA patients to determine the effect of nerve mobilization on joint inflammation. Twelve RA patients were recruited from the community and were randomised into an experimental and a control group. In the experimental group, the subjects were taught a set of nerve mobilization exercises while the subjects in the control group were taught a set of gentle joint mobilization exercises. Both groups were instructed to practice the exercises daily. After a 4-week period, their RA pain scale (RAPS) and pain scores were examined, as well as the C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Subjects in the experimental group showed improvements in RAPS and pain scores after 4 weeks of nerve mobilization exercises, while CRP and ESR values remained unaffected. These preliminary data showed that nerve mobilization exercises might be beneficial in controlling joint pain in RA patients."

Eligible practices will have at least 50 rheumatoid arthritis patients, at least 2 rheumatologists, and an electronic medical record or typed notes. Each practice will be randomized to receive the intervention in either phase 1 (first 9 months) or phase 2 (second 9 months).
 The collaborative will consist of a series of 9 Learning Sessions (1 conducted face-to-face, the remaining conducted via webinar) as well as regular coaching sessions and collaborative sessions. The structure of the collaborative will be such that each learning session will focus on resources, expertise, and best practices that address common barriers to Treat-to-Target (TTT) adoption. The follow-up coaching and collaborative sessions will give providers the opportunity to reflect on what they have learned from their own practices and from each other.
 The first Learning Session was a one-day face-to-face meeting that consisted of orienting the teams to the Model for Improvement, describing the Change Package and its content, conducting team building activities focused on developing ideas for plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, and cross-team learning activities. (The PDSA cycles refer to tests of change, using four stages, that are performed as part of a quality improvement process.) The day primarily consisted of discussion sessions, and several lectures on TTT, disease activity measures, and shared decision making helped orient teams to the Change Package contents. There was ample time for teams to get feedback from expert faculty on their proposed tests of change and results to date. Subsequent Learning Sessions were conducted via webinar.
 We developed a web-based collaborative tool for the Learning Collaborative. It helped manage contents being shared across teams (i.e., key resources, PDSAs), displayed monthly improvement metrics, and provided a discussion board with conversation ""threads."" The tool was used in all Learning Sessions.
 Specific patient data will never be identified in the sessions of the Collaborative, and no specific patient data will be shared between the participating providers. Providers will be able to interact with each other to share general practice patterns and behaviors, but sensitive patient information will not be shared.
 The intervention will be conducted in 2 phases. In phase 1, a group of 5practices [Cohort 1] will initiate the collaborative, which will last 9 months. After 9 months, phase 2 will begin with the remaining practices [Cohort 2] initiating the second collaborative of the same content as cohort 1, and the second collaborative will also take 9 months to complete. The cohort 1 and cohort 2 collaborative groups will not have any interaction with each other, but cohort 2 will serve as a concurrent control to cohort 1 in the first 9 months of the intervention.
 De-identified data will be collected from participating sites to compare TTT practices prior to and following the Learning Collaborative intervention using a chart review abstraction tool. The tool has four items: 1) documentation of a treatment target; 2) documentation of shared decision making; 3) documentation of a disease activity measure; and 4) evidence that this information guided treatment decisions. This tool will be used to grade the visit in the two months immediately prior to the start of Phase 1 and the visit in the two months immediately prior to the end of Phase 1; a change score between baseline to follow-up will be calculated. The range of change in implementation of TTT can vary from -4 (worsening from 4 at baseline to 0 at follow-up) to +4 (improvement from 0 at baseline to 4 at follow-up). Thus, the range of change scores will be from -4 to +4, a 9-point ordinal scale. The baseline visit will be considered the patient visit within two months before the start of Phase 1 (January 2015). If there are multiple visits in this time-frame, then the note for the visit most proximal to January 2015 (start of the study) will be assessed. The end of Phase 1 visit will be considered the visit within two months before November 1, 2015. Again, if there are multiple visits in this time-frame, then the note for the visit most proximal to October 1, 2015 will be assessed. When assessing the performance at each site, we will randomly sample the medical records of patients with RA who have visits documented within these two time-frames.
 Surveys will also be collected from patients and providers to assess satisfaction with the patient-provider interaction and shared decision-making. RA patients were randomly selected at each site to complete a questionnaire rating their satisfaction with the shared decision-making process using the three item collaboRATE scale. This was carried out at the start of Phase I and will be re-assessed at the end of Phase 1. Similarly, we asked providers involved in the Learning Collaborative from all sites in both groups to complete a modified version of this questionnaire; this will also be re-assessed at the end of Phase 1. During Phase 2, the only outcomes we plan to assess are the primary outcome of TTT implementation as well as the patient collaboRATE scale.
 The primary analysis will compare the primary outcome among the Learning Collaborative sites with the control sites. The mean change in implementation of TTT for the Learning Collaborative arm will be compared with implementation of TTT for the control arm after accounting for intra-cluster correlation using linear mixed models. Although the normality assumption may be violated when the outcome variable is ordinal, linear mixed models should still be valid for the proposed sample size. Treatment arm will be the exposure of interest. Covariates included in the model will include provider-level characteristics (such as age, gender, training), patient-level characteristics (age, gender, baseline disease activity, baseline RA drugs), and other covariates found to be unbalanced at baseline. While these characteristics should be balanced given the random assignment to treatment arm, the small number of centers in each arm opens the possibility of baseline differences and thus the rationale for adjustment. Similarly, for the secondary outcomes (dichotomous variables), we will use generalized linear mixed models for binary outcomes.
 The trial has been powered based on the primary outcome - the estimated difference in change in TTT implementation between the Learning Collaborative intervention and the control sites. Several other assumptions underpin the sample size estimation. First, the control group would have no or only small change (0-5%) change in implementation of TTT compared with a change in the intervention group of 20-40%, an improvement level observed in a similar prior trial using a Learning Collaborative. Second, we will include 5 sites in the intervention group, and 6 in the control group. We assume that average number of providers in each practice is 5, and expect there would be substantial intra-cluster correlation (ICC) among patients within a given provider. We conservatively assume a range of ICC is 0.1-0.3 based on prior work. Third, the significant level (alpha) would be two-sided 0.05, and the goal power would be 80%.
 Based on these assumptions, we estimated sample sizes for the proposed trial. The required number of patients per provider needed to detected meaningful differences was calculated for each set of assumptions. Based on these estimates, we will review a random 6 patients per provider with eligible visits to ensure an adequate sample size to achieve 80% power."

Pharmacological conditioning with placebo medication can result in comparable treatment effects and reduced side effects compared to regular treatment in various clinical populations, and may be applied to achieve enhanced drug effects. In the current study protocol, pharmacological conditioning is applied to achieve enhanced treatment effects in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The results from this study broaden the knowledge on the potential of pharmacological conditioning and provide a potential innovative treatment option to optimize long-term pharmacological treatment effectiveness for patients with inflammatory conditions, such as recent-onset RA., METHODS: A multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial is conducted in patients with recent-onset RA. Participants start on standardized pharmacological treatment for 16 weeks, which consists of methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg/week and a tapered schedule of prednisone 60 mg or 30 mg. After 4 months, participants in clinical remission (based on the rheumatologist's opinion and a targeted score below 1.6 on a 44-joint disease activity score (DAS44)) are randomized to 1 of 2 groups: (1) the control group (C), which continues with a standardized treatment schedule of MTX 15 mg/week or (2) the pharmacological conditioning group (PC), which receives an MTX treatment schedule in alternating high and low dosages. In the case of persistent clinical remission after 8 months, treatment is tapered and discontinued linearly in the C group and variably in the PC group. Both groups receive the same cumulative amount of MTX during each period. Logistic regression analysis is used to compare the proportion of participants with drug-free clinical remission after 12 months between the C group and the PC group. Secondary outcome measures include clinical functioning, laboratory assessments, and self-reported measures after each 4-month period up to 18 months after study start., DISCUSSION: The results from this study broaden the knowledge on the potential of pharmacological conditioning and provide a potential innovative treatment option to optimize long-term pharmacological treatment effectiveness in patients with inflammatory conditions, such as recent-onset RA., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register, NL5652.

Method(s): We investigated the profiles of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) count in treatment-naive patients with SRDs, osteoarthritis and pneumonia diagnosed at Seoul National University Hospital during 2004-2016. SRDs included rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD). Associations between inflammatory markers were evaluated using Pearson's correlation and regression analysis. ROC curve analysis was performed to examine the predictive value of inflammatory markers for SRD diagnosis. Result(s): We identified a total of 1191 patients. Leukocytosis was present in < 20% SRD patients. There was marked variability in ESR and CRP levels among different SRDs. The highest mean CRP levels (mean +/- SD, mg/dL) were observed in AOSD (11.3 +/- 7.9), followed by RA (2.0 +/- 3.3), IIM (1.8 +/- 3.5), SLE (1.5 +/- 3.1), SSc (0.6 +/- 1.3) and AS (0.08 +/- 0.1). Mean ESR (mm/h) was also highest in AOSD (71.2 +/- 31.0), followed by SLE (47.3 +/- 34.2), RA (45.5 +/- 30.6), IIM (40.8 +/- 24.8) and SSc (27.8 +/- 26.0). All SRDs showed significant positive correlations between ESR and CRP: greatest in RA (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) and weakest in SLE (r = 0.20, p = 0.03). WBC correlated weakly with CRP but not with ESR in most SRDs. While the AUC for WBC count was less than that of ESR or CRP, the AUC for ESR and CRP were similar in SRD. The optimal cuff-off values for inflammatory markers predicting SRD were within or slightly above the normal limit. Conclusion(s): ESR, CRP and WBC are not always elevated in treatment-naive patients with SRD. Individual SRDs have a unique profile of inflammatory markers. However, routine inflammatory markers should still be interpreted with caution when diagnosing and assessing disease activity in those with SRD.Key Points*Leukocytosis and elevation of ESR and CRP are not always present in all systemic rheumatic diseases.*Inflammatory markers are often dissociated and they are not specific for disease diagnosis.*Better biomarkers, which measure disease-specific local and systemic inflammation, are needed.Copyright ¬© 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR)."

Patients were divided into two groups. The intervention group received PRP (n=15) injections on days 0, 30, 60 and 90, as well as hyaluronic acid five times per day. The comparison group received hyaluronic acid (n=15) five times per day. Subjects were measured at baseline and at 30, 60 and 90 days. The primary outcome measures were changes in corneal staining according to the Oxford classification, results of the Schirmer test and tear break-up time (TBUT). The secondary outcome measures were changes in the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and treatment compliance., RESULTS: All subjects completed the study. The intervention group showed improvements in all primary outcome measures when compared with the control group, including a reduction in corneal staining (p<0.001), increase in the mean Schirmer value from 5.6+/-0.7to 9.0+/-1.1mm, and an increase in TBUT from 4.0+/-0.4to 6.4+/-0.4s at day 90. An improvement in subjective OSDI values was also found., CONCLUSION: PRP injection is safe and effective in improving tear parameters as well as subjective parameters, and was found to be superior to hyaluronic acid alone in the management of patients with severe dry eye.

To standardize medical behavior and reduce medical costs, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China (former Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China) has formatted and generalized clinical pathway work. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of clinical pathway in total knee arthroplasty. METHODS: One hundred and thirty patients who were candidates of total knee arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University between November 2013 and October 2014. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: study group (n=65, clinical pathway intervention) and control group (n=65, no clinical pathway intervention). The length of hospital stay, total and concrete medical fees, antibiotic usage, postoperative complications and postoperative knee function were compared between groups. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Length of hospital stay and preoperative hospitalization time were shortened in the study group, total cost of hospitalization, drug cost and inspection cost were significantly reduced compared with the control group (P < 0.01). A more reasonable use of antibiotics was found in the study group than in the control group, showing significant differences (P < 0.01). At 3 months after operation, KSS score of knee joint function was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.01). There was no difference between the two groups in the operation fee, postoperative complications and KSS score at postoperative 1 month (P > 0.05). The use of clinical pathway can reduce hospitalization time and medical costs, improve knee function and quality of life of patients following total knee arthroplasty."

9737093,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=50183,10.2147/jir.s198611,"Purpose: Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes citrullination, a post-translational modification that can alter structure, function and antigenicity of proteins. Citrullination in the lungs due to smoking is believed to initiate an anti-citrulline immune response in rheumatoid arthritis. Citrullination in other inflamed organs has also been demonstrated, but it is not known whether smoking or inflammatory processes in general result in release of relevant amounts of PAD into the circulation with potential to cause citrullination of proteins at various anatomical sites. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces an acute systemic inflammation response. In the present study, we investigate whether smoking or acute systemic inflammation causes release of PAD into the circulation. Patients and methods: This study included 36 patients with coronary heart disease (16 smokers and 20 non-smokers) undergoing CABG surgery with CPB. Circulating levels of PAD2 and PAD4, PAD activity, the neutrophil activation markers MPO, MMP-9 and lipocalin-2, the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10, and the chemokine CXCL8 were measured 2 hrs preoperatively and 2 hrs postoperatively. Results: At baseline, serum PAD2 and PAD4 concentration did not differ between smokers and non-smokers. However, serum from non-smokers contained higher PAD activity than serum from smokers. Circulating PAD2 levels and PAD activity increased markedly in both groups after surgery, as did all neutrophil activation markers, cytokines and chemokine. PAD2 levels correlated with neutrophil activation markers, but not with cytokine and chemokine levels. Conclusion:  Blood levels of PAD2 did not differ significantly between smokers and non-smokers, but smokers had decreased PAD activity in the circulation. PAD2 levels and PAD activity increased in blood during inflammation induced by CABG with CPB. This suggests that acute inflammation, ischemia or reperfusion, or a combination of these, leads to systemic spreading of enzymatically active PAD, which may affect protein function and induce generation of citrullinated self-antigens."

Aim: the purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of homoeopathic medicines in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methodology: one hundred and twenty subjects were enrolled in the study in a ratio of 1: 1, assuming 20% dropouts to obtain 96 evaluable subjects at day 84; that is, 60 subjects were randomly allocated to homoeopathic treatment arm, while another 60 were allocated placebo. Proportion of patients with an ACR20 response in both treatment groups on day 84 was compared with baseline. Another secondary variable was the change from baseline in disease activity score 28 C reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) on day 84. Results: out of 120 subjects, 16 subjects dropped out and 104 subjects completed the study. In the study out of 104 subjects, 54 subjects received homoeopathic medicines: there were 13 (23%) ACR20 responders in the treatment arm and 41 (77%) subjects were ACR20 non-responders. There were 50 subjects who received placebo, out of whom 3 (6%) subjects were ACR20 responders and the remaining 47 (94%) subjects were nonresponders. No remarkable change was seen with placebo in DAS28-CRP. There was a positive relation between baseline DAS28-CRP as compared with DAS28-CRP on the 84th day.

9737127,,10.1371/journal.pone.0312546,"Objectives: cardiovascular comorbidity is increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In both RA and SLE, retrospective studies have shown an association between treatment with chloroquine and a positive impact on cardiovascular risk factors. However, interventional studies are scarce. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (Plaquenil¬¨√Ü) treatment on the blood lipid profile and vascular function, after 4 and 8 weeks, in patients with RA and SLE. Methods: patients with RA (n = 25) or SLE (n = 7) (mean age 53 years) and low to medium disease activity [28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) < 4.6 and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) < 6, respectively] were included. Twelve patients with RA and four with SLE were randomized to start HCQ treatment after 4 weeks to exclude the impact of care on the results. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), highdensity lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoproteins, blood-glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure and vascular function, as measured with pulse-wave analysis (Arteriograph¬¨√Ü), were investigated before, and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment with HCQ. Results: thirty patients completed the study period of 8 weeks with HCQ medication. At the point of 4 weeks the TC levels decreased (mean 5.43 mmol/L to 5.1 mmol/L) and remained significantly decreased at 8 weeks (p = 0.005). This was also seen in LDL levels, which decreased from 3.03 mmol/L at inclusion to 2.68 mmol/L after 4 weeks and stayed significantly decreased after 8 weeks (p = 0.002), as well as apolipoprotein B, which decreased after 4 weeks from 0.95 g/L to 0.90 g/L and remained significantly lowered after 8 weeks (p = 0.033). HbA1c levels also decreased, however not with statistical significance. No significant changes were seen in vascular function. There was no significant difference in the results of the two treatment groups implicating a genuine impact of HCQ. Conclusions: HCQ treatment over 8 weeks improved the lipid profile in patients with low-to medium-active RA and SLE. A numerical improvement in HbA1c levels was seen. No influence on vascular function was noticed"

Advances in the treatment of RA, such as biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), have provided better clinical outcomes, including the achievement of remission for patients with RA, but some patients cannot receive these treatments because of their side effects and high cost, and not all patients achieve remission. Although the efficacy of denosumab, which is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody with a high affinity for the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) ligand (RANKL), in the treatment of RA has been reported in clinical trials, the efficacy of denosumab in both preventing joint destruction and improving disease activity has not been evaluated in a real-world setting., METHODS/DESIGN: This open-label, randomized, parallel-group study will compare the continued use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) alone with the combined use of csDMARDs and denosumab in patients whose RA is treated with csDMARDs. In total, 44 patients with RA will be randomly assigned to receive additional treatment with denosumab or to continue RA treatment without additional denosumab. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months. To analyze bone erosion and bone micro-architecture precisely, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) will be performed every 6 months. The primary endpoint is changes in the depth of bone erosion as measured by HR-pQCT from baseline to 6 months. Important secondary endpoints are the changes from baseline in the width and volume of bone erosion as measured by HR-pQCT and changes from baseline in the depth of bone erosion at 12 months. Changes in bone micro-architecture will also be analyzed as an exploratory endpoint., DISCUSSION: The results of this study are expected to provide strong evidence regarding the usefulness of denosumab for the treatment of RA. Moreover, by using HR-pQCT, this study will also reveal the effect of denosumab not only on bone erosion but also on bone micro-architecture., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry as UMIN000030575 on December 26, 2017."

Brief name: initial bony cuts (distal femur and proximal tibia) in routine total knee arthroplasty made according to the kinematic alignment outlined in the surgical plan
 Item 2. Why: there has been a recent surge in popularity of kinematic alignment in total knee arthroplasty with a lack of evidence to support the assumed benefits. At the same time, knee ligament balance appears to be a major surgical factor towards an optimized patient outcome. This intervention aims to restore patients to their native knee alignment and ligament balance.
 Item 3. What (materials): all instrumentation involved in the intervention arm are standard of care for routine total knee arthroplasty.
 Item 4. What (procedure): initial bony cuts to the distal femur and proximal tibia in the intervention group will be made according to the kinematic alignment in the surgical plan. This plan will include an aim for femoral and tibial component position relative to the mechanical axis of the bones. These cuts will be guided and validated by a full optical surgical navigation system to ensure maximum accuracy. The VERASENSE‚Ñ¢ (OrthoSensor, USA) pressure monitoring insert will be used after the proposed alignment has been achieved, but in the intervention group, surgeons will be blinded as to the initial pressure readings. After recording the initial pressure data, surgeons will be able to view the data to allow soft tissue balancing as per standard operating techniques. Any soft tissue or bony adjustments undertaken to achieve this will be recorded.
 Item 5. Who provided: two knee arthroplasty surgeons at one hospital will perform all the surgeries. Both surgeons have extensive experience in all aspects of total knee arthroplasty.
 Item 6. How: the intervention will be provided to patients undergoing routine total knee arthroplasty who have been allocated to the intervention arm preoperatively.
 Item 7. Where: all interventions will be provided at St George Private Hospital, Kogarah, NSW.
 Item 8. When and how much: the intervention is intra-operative.

However, their success at improving adherence is debatable. This study aimed to assess the influence of different modes of patient education on medication adherence in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)., Materials and methods: One hundred and twenty RA patients with non-adherence, defined as pill count >=80% or medication-taking behavior questionnaire for Thai patient >=23, were randomized by block randomization and assigned in a 1:1 allocation ratio to two study arms: multi-component intervention group or single intervention group. The multi-component intervention group received 30-minute directed counseling and a disease information pamphlet. The single intervention group received only a disease information pamphlet. The primary outcomes were an improvement in an adherence rate measured by pill count after 12 weeks. The Thai Clinical Trial Registry number is TCTR20171207003., Results: After 12 weeks, the pill count adherence rate increased significantly from baseline in both study groups. In the multi-component intervention group, adherence rate increased from 92.21+/-14.05 to 97.59+/-10.07 (P=0.002) and in the single intervention group, it increased from 88.60+/-19.66 to 92.42+/-14.27 (P=0.044). However, the mean difference between the multi-component intervention group and the single intervention group was not significant (5.38+/-12.90 vs 3.18+/-14.23, P=0.531). Clinical outcomes, including disease activity score 28, EuroQoL-5D, EuroQol visual analog scale, pain score, and physician global assessment were unchanged from baseline in both groups., Conclusion: Patient education significantly improved adherence. However, there were no differences between single education intervention and multi-component education intervention in improving medication adherence. Provision of a disease information pamphlet with or without directed counseling can equally enhance medication adherence of patients with RA."

The prevalence of RA among cases of TEA and TSA decreased by 50% (p < 0.0001) and 18% (p = 0.0016), respectively; a 38.0% decrease occurred in the prevalence of RA among TAA (p = 0.06); and nonsignificant increases were seen among THA and TKA. The average age difference between RA and non-RA patients undergoing TJA narrowed by 2 years (p < 0.0001). There was a greater reduction in the proportion of TSA, TEA, and TAA groups among women with RA than men with RA. In the TSA and TEA groups, there was a reduction in the proportion of whites with RA, but not blacks. The proportion of privately insured TSA and TAA patients with RA decreased, while patients with RA undergoing TSA, TEA, or TAA who were receiving Medicaid (government medical insurance) remained relatively stable over time., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of RA has decreased among TSA and TEA patients. A nonsignificant decline occurred among TAA patients. The average age of TJA patients with RA is beginning to mirror those without RA. Sex ratios for TSA, TEA, and TAA patients are following a similar pattern. These results may be evidence of the success of modern RA treatment strategies."

However, there is a paucity of modern medical evidence to support its effectiveness and safety. Thus, we propose to implement a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using, as the experimental intervention, topical application of a hospital-compounded gel preparation of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF). Methods: this study will be an 8-week double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at Guang'anmen Hospital in Beijing, China, and 168 patients with moderately active RA will be randomly assigned with a 1: 1 ratio to apply a topical gel preparation containing TwHF or placebo. The primary outcome variable will be the proportion of subjects, by study group, to achieve a 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) by week 8. Secondary outcome measures to be assessed at weeks 4 or 8 will include: measurement of ACR20 response rate at week 4, ACR50 response rate, the changes in DAS28 score, and joint synovitis classification assessment monitored by musculoskeletal ultrasound. Safety evaluations conducted at weeks 4, 8 and 12 will be based on spontaneous complaints by the study subjects, but special emphasis will be focused on cutaneous allergy and alterations of menstruation in premenopausal female participants. Statistical analyses will be performed using the intention to treat analysis data set. Discussion: this proposed clinical trail is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CET based on a single topically-applied agent in a relatively large patient population with RA. This study protocol gives a detailed description of the usage and dosage of the topical compound TwHF gel and the methodology of this study. In addition, it is hoped that the outcomes of this study will be viewed as supporting the generalizability of CET in the setting of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The results of this study are expected to have important public health implications for Asian RA patients that currently utilize CET as a complimentary treatment.

This study evaluated the 2-year retention rate and 12-month efficacy of adalimumab in RA and PsA patients, previously treated with etanercept. RA and PsA patients from 11 Italian Rheumatology Units received adalimumab after first-line etanercept failure. Two-year adalimumab retention rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models were developed to examine predictors of drug persistence. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were developed to examine potential predictors of 12-month DAS-28 remission. The study population included 117 RA (disease duration of 10.1 +/- 7.7 years and baseline DAS28-ESR of 4.97 +/- 1.3) and 102 PsA (disease duration of 7.1 +/- 5.1 years and baseline DAPSA of 24.6 +/- 11.8). The 2-year retention rate was 48.2% in RA and 56.5% in PsA patients. Concomitant methotrexate treatment was not associated with increased drug survival in both groups. Similarly, cause of etanercept discontinuation or treatment duration was not associated with retention rate. 12-month remission and low disease activity were achieved, respectively, in 27.3% and 23.9% of RA patients and 27.4% and 23.5% PsA of patients. In multivariate models, etanercept discontinuation due to inefficacy (OR 0.27, 95% CI 1.03-0.73; p = 0.009) and baseline DAS-28 (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.69; p < 0.001) remained significant negative predictors of remission in RA patients.

After dividing the patients into two groups based on the occurrence of LFT abnormality during follow-up, we compared demographic and clinical features between the two groups. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the impact of INH treatment on LFT abnormality. The impact of INH treatment on the persistence of TNF inhibitors was also evaluated with the log-rank test and the Cox-proportional hazards model., RESULTS: A total of 312 RA patients including 96 patients (30.9%) who took INH for LTBI were included in this analysis. Thirty-nine patients (12.5%) experienced LFT abnormalities while using TNF inhibitors. The use of INH was associated with LFT abnormalities (odds ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39 to 6.48) after adjusting for covariates, including methotrexate use. However, the persistence of TNF inhibitors over 5 years did not differ between patients receiving or not receiving INH treatment (49.4 vs. 54.6%, p = 0.79). INH treatment was not a risk factor for discontinuation of TNF inhibitors (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.57)., CONCLUSION: INH treatment for LTBI in RA patients who started TNF inhibitors is associated with the occurrence of LFT abnormality; however, it does not lead to discontinuation of TNF inhibitors."

9737240,,10.2196/15105,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine based on self-measurement of disease activity could be one of the key components to create the health care system of the future. Previous publications in various medical fields have shown that it is possible to safely telemonitor patients while reducing the number of outpatient clinic visits. For this purpose, we developed a mobile phone app for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which allows them to self-monitor their disease., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of self-initiated care assisted by a smartphone app in patients with RA., METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial that will be performed for 1 year. A total of 176 patients with RA will be randomized to either self-initiated care with only one scheduled follow-up consultation assisted by our app or usual care. The coprimary outcome measures are the number of outpatient clinic consultations with a rheumatologist taking place during the trial period and the mean disease activity score as measured by the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) at 12 months. The secondary outcomes are patient satisfaction, adherence, patient empowerment, and cost evaluation of health care assisted by the app., RESULTS: Recruitment started in May 2019, and up to 18 months will be required for completion of recruitment. Thus far, 78 patients have been randomized, and thus far, experiences with the app have been positive. The study results are expected to be published by the end of 2021., CONCLUSIONS: The completion of this study will provide important data regarding the following: (1) safety of self-initiated care supported by a smartphone app in terms of DAS28 and (2) efficacy of lowering health care usage with this new strategy of providing health care., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register NL7715; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7715., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/15105.

The TwHF cream group also had more improvement than the placebo group on DAS28-ESR (1.1 vs 0.5, P = 0.001), DAS28- CRP (1.4 vs 0.7, P = 0.001), tender joint count (5.5 vs 2.6, P = 0.018), swollen joint count (3.5 vs 1.6, P = 0.003) and Physician's global assessment (25.8 vs 13.0, P = 0.002), as well as C-reactive protein (11.2 vs 2.7, P = 0.048). Except 2 skin allergy events in TwHF cream group, no other substantive adverse events were observed., CONCLUSION: On the short term, TwHF cream is likely to be an effective and safety complimentary treatment in patients with active RA."

In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis [American College of Rheumatology (ACR) functional class I to III] who had failed to respond to previous treatment with >= 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), etanercept, alone or in combination with methotrexate, produced improvements in all components included in the ACR core set of disease activity measures. A dose-response effect was apparent with etanercept 0.25 to 16 mg/m2 twice weekly in a randomised, double-blind study in 180 patients. The mean number of swollen or tender joints at the end of the 12-week study decreased by > 50% in patients treated with etanercept 16 mg/m2 twice weekly and by < 25% in patients treated with placebo. In a 24-week multicentre, randomised double-blind study in 234 patients who were not allowed to use DMARDs, etanercept 10 or 25 mg twice weekly had a rapid onset of effect. Significantly more patients treated with etanercept 25 mg twice weekly than placebo experienced 20 (ACR 20), 50 (ACR 50) or 70% (ACR 70) improvement in ACR criteria after 3 and 6 months. Limited evidence suggests that the therapeutic effects of etanercept are maintained for up to 2 years. Etanercept 25 mg twice weekly produced significant improvement in patients receiving oral or subcutaneous methotrexate 10 to 25 mg/week in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with etanercept plus methotrexate (71%) than placebo plus methotrexate (27%) achieved the ACR 20 criteria after 6 months. Moreover, 39 and 15% of patients treated with etanercept plus methotrexate, but no placebo plus methotrexate recipients, had achieved the ACR 50 and ACR 70 criteria at this time. Etanercept 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly reduced disease activity in a preliminary, noncomparative study in 69 children aged >= 4 years with refractory juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Although the overall frequency of infections was similar in patients treated with etanercept or placebo, upper respiratory tract infections were more common in patients treated with etanercept (29%) than placebo (16%). Injection site reactions occurred more frequently in etanercept- than placebo-treated patients, but did not bias the results of any study. Conclusions: when etanercept is administered alone or in combination with methotrexate in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis, significant reductions in disease activity occur within 2 weeks and are sustained for at least 6 months. Thus, etanercept appears to be particularly well suited for use in patients who fail to respond to treatment with DMARDs"

9737253,,10.3390/medicina56040178,"Background and Objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a severe autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints accompanied by the progressive deformation and destruction of cartilage and joint bones. This study aims to gain insight into the outcomes related to adherence in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Predicting the medication adherence in RA patients is a key point to improve the treatment outcome. Materials and Methods: A number of 119 Romanian patients with RA were included and divided into two groups: first group included 79 patients treated with conventional therapy and second group included 40 patients treated with biologic therapy. A CQR-9 (compliance questionnaire rheumatology with nine items) and PDSQ (psychiatric diagnostic screening questionnaire) were performed to assess correlations between medication adherence, patient sociodemographic variables, 11 psychiatric scales (major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, psychosis, agoraphobia, social phobia, drug abuse/dependence, generalized anxiety disorder, somatization disorder, hypochondriasis) and lifestyle (bulimia, alcohol intake). Results: Whilst modelling factors associated with adherence, it was found that women and patients with higher education are more adherent. From the psychiatric indicators, only major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder were found to be positively correlated with therapeutic adherence. None of the assessed lifestyle factors influenced the adherence of RA patients. Conclusion: The knowledge of factors that impact on treatment adherence can be useful for clinicians to guide patient-centred care."

There are very few studies evaluating the problems encountered in the hands in patients with SLE. The aim of this study is to evaluate hand functions in patients with SLE and compare them with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy subjects., Materials and methods: A total 46 female patients meeting the SLE classification criteria were recruited. Similarly, 51 female RA patients and 46 healthy female subjects served as the control groups. To assess the upper extremity disability level, the Disability Arm Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH) was used. Some functional performances such as hand grip and pinch strength were evaluated using a dynamometer and the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), respectively., Results: Hand functions were found to be impaired in both SLE and RA patients when compared to healthy controls. In addition, patients with SLE showed better performance in the NHPT, hand grip, and pinch strength than RA patients (P < 0.05). However, the patient-reported disability level was similar in both patient groups (P > 0.05)., Conclusion: Similar to patients with RA, hand functions are significantly impaired in patients with SLE in daily activities."

Data from other regions are largely missing. We report data from South American countries with different backgrounds and health-care systems but similar registries., METHODS: We merged 2010-2016 data from two registries, BIOBADABRASIL (Brazil) and BIOBADASAR (Argentina), which share the same protocol, online platform and data monitoring process. Patients with active RA were included when they began the first bDMARD or a conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD, control group). The SI incidence rate (IR) per 1000 patient/years and adjusted IR ratio (aIRR) were estimated for bDMARDs and csDMARDs., RESULTS: Data were analysed for 3717 RA patients with an exposure of 13,380 patient/years. The 2591 patients treated with bDMARDs (64% tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFi)) had a follow-up of 9300 years, and the 1126 treated with csDMARDs had an exposure of 4081 patient/years. The SI IR was 30.54 (CI 27.18-34.30) for all bDMARDs and 5.15 (CI 3.36-7.89) for csDMARDs. The aIRR between the two groups was 2.03 ([1.05, 3.9] p = 0.034) for the first 6 months of treatment but subsequently increased to 8.26 ([4.32, 15.76] p < 0.001). The SI IR for bDMARDs decreased over time in both registries, dropping from 36.59 (28.41-47.12) in 2012 to 7.27 (4.79-11.05) in 2016., CONCLUSION: While SI remains a major concern in South American patients with RA treated with bDMARDs, a favourable trend toward a reduction was observed in the last years.Key Points* New comprehensive data on biologic drugs safety from international collaboration in South America.* First proposal for national registries data merging in South America.* Serious infections remain a major concern in RA patients treated with biologics.* A significant reduction of serious infections in RA patients exposed to biologics was observed over a 7 years period."

The evaluation of therapy effectiveness (DAS28-ESR or DAS28-CRP) and monitoring of ADRs was an element of routine patient management. Therapy effectiveness was scored as the achievement of remission or response (according to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR))., RESULTS: Among 761 (98.7%) patients that continued sMTX (after 25-31 weeks), clinical response was achieved by 69.5%, remission by 19.2% and low disease activity by 34.2%. Patients aged >60 years were less likely to achieve both remission (odds ratio (OR) = 0.61 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.39-0.93)) and clinical response (OR = 0.82 (95% CI = 0.71-0.95)), while overweight/obese patients (OR = 1.11 (95% CI = 1.00-1.24)) and those with early RA had greater chance to reach a clinical response (OR = 1.18 (95% CI = 1.03-1.34)). There were 16 ADRs (no serious or severe). In addition, at least 2-fold increase in alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was noted in 10 patients (1.3%)., CONCLUSIONS: After 6-month therapy with sMTX, about 70% of patients with RA achieve a clinical response, and remission was observed in 20%. Younger age, overweight/obesity and an early stage of the disease are factors increasing therapy effectiveness; sMTX is well tolerated."

Physiotherapy consisted of daily eccentric strengthening exercises under initial professional supervision. Inclusion criteria were a Placzek score greater than 4. Exclusion criteria were previous surgery, rheumatic arthritis, elbow instability, radicular symptoms, higher-grade extensor tendon rupture, or cervical osteoarthritis. The clinical evaluation was performed after 12 weeks and 12 months. The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) scale, Placzek Score, the pain rating (VAS), range of motion and the Subjective Elbow Score were evaluated. // RESULTS: Of the initially 61 patients, 31 were followed up after 12 weeks and 22 after 12 months. Twenty-nine patients (43%) were male, the mean age was 46, and 44 patients (66%) had the right elbow involved. At 12 weeks, there was a pain reduction on the VAS in both groups (PT + O: 6.5-3.7 [p = .001]; PT: 4.7-4.1 [p = .468]), albeit it was only significant for the PT + O group.

All study designs were eligible. Two authors independently conducted literature screening. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes were any other pain-related outcome and any other safety outcome that was reported. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). We conducted narrative evidence synthesis and assessed the conclusiveness of included studies regarding efficacy and safety., RESULTS: We included 17 studies with 599 participants, which analyzed various pain syndromes. Two studies were randomized controlled trials; both included participants with low back pain (LBP). Non-randomized studies included patients with the following indications: LBP, postsurgical pain, pain associated with herpes zoster, cervicogenic headache, complex regional pain syndrome type 1, intractable vertebral metastatic pain, chronic scrotal and inguinal pain, occipital radiating pain in rheumatoid arthritis and chronic migraine. In these studies, the PRF was usually initiated after other treatments have failed. Eleven studies had positive conclusive statements (11/17) about efficacy; the remaining had positive inconclusive statements. Only three studies provided conclusiveness of evidence statements regarding safety - two indicated that the evidence was positive conclusive, and one positive inconclusive. The risk of bias was predominantly unclear in randomized and serious in non-randomized studies., CONCLUSION: Poor quality and few participants characterize evidence about benefits and harms of DRG PRF in patients with non-neuropathic pain. Results from available studies should only be considered preliminary. Not all studies have reported data regarding the safety of the intervention, but those that did, indicate that the intervention is relatively safe. As the procedure is non-destructive and early results are promising, further comparative studies about PRF in non-neuropathic pain syndromes would be welcomed."

9737292,,10.3899/jrheum.190299,"Objective. The role of methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of spondyloarthritis (SpA) remains uncertain. Aims were to compare MTX and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) persistence in spondyloarthritis versus rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to determine whether concomitant conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD) use is associated with improved TNFi persistence in SpA. Methods. This retrospective cohort study using Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database 2000-2014 identified patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) without prior biologic use who were initiating MTX or a TNFi. Cox proportional hazards models compared time to medication discontinuation over the next 2 years between patients with RA, PsA, or AS, adjusting for potential confounders. In similar analyses stratified by disease, Cox models were used to assess whether concomitant use of csDMARD was associated with TNFi persistence. Results. We identified 31,527 MTX initiators (26,708 RA, 2939 PsA, 1880 AS) and 34,651 TNFi initiators (24,134 RA, 6705 PsA, 3812 AS). MTX was discontinued sooner in patients with PsA [adjusted HR (aHR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.16] and AS (aHR 1.23, 1.16-1.31) versus RA, while TNFi were discontinued at similar rates in RA and AS and discontinued later in PsA (aHR 0.93, 0.89-0.97). Concomitant use of MTX (compared to no csDMARD) was associated with lower rates of TNFi discontinuation in RA (aHR 0.85, 0.80-0.89), PsA (aHR 0.81, 0.74-0.89), and AS (aHR 0.79, 0.67-0.93). Conclusion. MTX discontinuation occurs sooner in patients with PsA and AS versus RA. Concomitant use of MTX with a TNFi, however, is associated with improved TNFi persistence in all 3 diseases.Copyright ¬© 2020. All rights reserved."

9737306,,10.1186/1477-7525-11-55,"Background: arthritis is the most common cause of disability, and is associated with activity limitation, work disability and significant health care costs. Approximately 50 million US adults have doctor-diagnosed arthritis. Non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics have worse arthritis impact despite having the same or lower prevalence of arthritis compared to non-Hispanic whites. People with arthritis who exercise regularly have less pain, more energy, improved sleep and better day-to-day function. Yet, arthritis is one of the most common reasons for limiting physical activity. Improving health quality for people with chronic disease requires patients to take responsibility for their own care. Self-efficacy enhancing interventions may enable individuals to undertake self-care activities that improve physical and mental well-being. Attention is now being focused on complementary and integrated non-pharmacologic self-care approaches. Yoga is among the top 10 complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities. Stretching, strength, posture, balance, and the ability to adjust pace and intensity are important safety components for patients with arthritis, all of which yoga encompasses. Mind-body interventions, such as yoga, that teach stress management with physical activity may be well suited for investigation in both osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Yoga users are predominately white, female, and college educated. In a descriptive study of patients enrolled in the Natural History of Rheumatic Disease in Minority Communities protocol only 4.6% were doing yoga. These disparities may be related to cost, access, and cultural beliefs. There are few studies that examine yoga in minority populations; none of these address arthritis.
 Study Objective: the primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of providing yoga to an urban, minority population with arthritis.
 Secondary Objective: to determine the appropriateness of specific physical and psychosocial measures for this population, and intervention with a focus on physical function and patient reported measures.

Primary outcome included (i) minimum time required for onset of pain relief (Tm) assessed through patients' visual analog scale (VAS); (ii) % change in VAS score from onset of pain relief to end of 8 weeks. Secondary outcome included change in disease activity score (DAS-28)., Results: At the end of 8-weeks, Group A reported 50% higher median pain relief scores (80% vs. 30%; P < 0.001) and DAS-28 scores (2.9 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.4; P = 0.012) compared to Group B; however, Tm remained comparable (19 +/- 2 vs. 20 +/- 2 days; P = 0.419). Occurrence of hypovitaminosis-D was lower (23.3%) compared to Indian prevalence rates and was a risk factor for developing active disease (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.52 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.67-21.16], P < 0.0001). Vitamin D deficiency was significantly (P < 0.001) more common in female gender, active disease, and shorter mean disease duration. Vitamin D levels were inversely correlated to disease activity as assessed by DAS-28 (r = -0.604; P < 0.001)., Conclusions: Vitamin-D deficiency is a risk factor for developing active disease in RA. Weekly supplementation of 60,000 IU of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 in early RA results in greater pain relief. The number needed to treat for this additional pain relief was 2., Identifier: CTRI/2018/01/011532 (www.ctri.nic.in)."

This study evaluated the real-world 1- and 5-year adherence to etanercept (ETN) among Iraqi patients with RA. Method(s): This observational, retrospective study assessed patient data entered in the National Center of Rheumatology in Iraq database during the period May 2012 - May 2017. Individuals aged >18 years, with a diagnosis of RA, and who required treatment with ETN, with or without MTX, were identified and included in the analysis. Those previously treated with a different biologic or who were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial were excluded. Adherence was assessed for 1- and 5-year periods, with 1-year adherence defined as 7 consecutive patient visits. Demographics, Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores, and adverse events (AEs) data were also collected. Editorial support was provided by Charlene Rivera, PhD, and Vojislav Pejovic, PhD, of Engage Scientific Solutions and was funded by Pfizer. Result(s): In total, data from 1293 individuals were collected. Approximately half (51.7%, n=668) were treated concomitantly with MTX and 40.4% were taking prednisolone. At baseline, the mean (+/- standard deviation) disease duration was 10.0 +/- 8.3 years, and mean CDAI and DAS28 scores were 27.6 +/- 13.0 and 5.7 +/- 2.0, respectively. The adherence to treatment at 1 year was 86.5% (n=1119) for all patients and 85.5% (n=571) for those also receiving MTX. Among patients who discontinued treatment at 1 year, 75.2% (n=112) did not specify a reason, 20.8% (n=31) reported lack of efficacy, and 4.0% (n=6) reported side effects as reasons for discontinuation. Patients who discontinued treatment at 1 year due to side effects or other unspecified reasons had significantly improved CDAI and DAS28 scores at the last follow-up visit compared with baseline scores (16.3 and 19.9 vs 26.3 and 26.3 for CDAI, respectively; 4.5 and 4.8 vs 5.4 and 5.5 for DAS28, respectively; p<=0.001). The adherence at 5 years was 61.3% (50.4% for patients treated concomitantly with MTX). Among patients who discontinued treatment at 5 years, 84.6% did not specify a reason, 12.2% reported lack of efficacy, and 3.2% reported side effects as reasons for discontinuation. Average CDAI and DAS28 scores significantly decreased at the last follow-up visit compared with baseline among patients still on treatment at 5 years (19.9 vs 26.6 and 4.7 vs 5.6, respectively; p=0.001). Conclusion(s): A majority of real-world Iraqi patients with RA were adherent to ETN treatment after 5 years. Furthermore, most patients tolerated treatment with ETN and had significant improvements in treatment scores at 5 years. Adherence was higher among patients in the total population compared with the subset receiving concomitant MTX."

A HB threshold of< 110 g/L (women) and < 120 g/L (men) was used to determine anemia. All the patients were divided into three groups: non-anemia group (HB >= 120 g/L (male) or 110 g/L (female)), mild anemia group ((90 g/L < HB < lower limit of normal), and medium to severe anemia group (HB <= 90 g/L). Serum HB level and anemia prevalence between RA patients and normal subjects were compared. Associations of HB level with disease activity, structural damage, and function of joint in different groups were also investigated., RESULTS: The average of HB level in RA was (109.08 +/- 17.96)g/l, which was lower than that in controls (136.75 +/- 14.57)g/l (P < 0.001). Anemia was observed in 47% of the RA patients, while prevalence of anemia in control group was only 4.4%. In RA group, percentages of non-anemia, mild anemia, and medium to severe anemia were 47%, 38%, and 15%. Compared with non-anemia RA patients, RA patients with anemia had higher disease activity, severer structural damage and worse function of joint (P < 0.001). With the increase of anemia, the disease activity, structural damage, and dysfunction of joints increased significantly (P < 0.05-0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that HB level was negatively correlated with disease activity parameters, degree of joint destruction, and function (P < 0.05-0.001). Logistic regression indicated that serum HB level was protective factors for disease activity and structural damage in RA (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: HB level was significantly related to disease activity and structural damage in RA patients.Key Points* Inflammatory anemia was popular (about a half) in patients with RA.* HB level was related to disease activity and structural damage in RA patients."

It is notable that this drug achieved the primary endpoint in four independent trials and demonstrated substantial reduction of organ damage accrual. The B cell depletion with antibodies against CD20 remains clinically relevant and of interest for future developments and the combination of both approaches (belimumab and anti-CD20) is an exciting idea. Blockade of the type I interferon receptor with anifrolumab was effective in a phase 3 trial and blocking interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 with ustekinumab is currently being tested in a phase 3 clinical trial. The old ideas of blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 have also not yet been forgotten. More novel approaches comprise Janus kinase (Jak) inhibition with positive phase 2 data for baricitinib and soon inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) as well as proteasome inhibitors.

However, there are still a few nonresponders. It is logical to suggest that employing combinations including LEF that produce synergistic effects in terms of pharmacological activity is a promising strategy to improve clinical outcomes., Methods: We propose a novel approach for predicting LEF combinations through investigating the potential effects of drug targets on the disease signaling network. We first constructed an RA signaling network with disease-associated driver genes. Thousands of available FDA-approved and investigational compounds were then selected based on a drug-RA network, which was generated using an algorithm model named synergistic score that combines chemical structure, functional prediction and target pathway. We then validated our predicted combination in a prospective clinical trial., Results: Ligustrazine (LIG), a key component of the Chinese herb Chuanxiong and an approved drug in China, ranked first according to synergistic score. In the clinical trial, after 48 weeks, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response rate was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the LEF group [58.8% (45.4%, 72.3%)] than in the LEF + LIG group [78.7% (68.5%, 89.0%)]. Consistently, the erosion score was lower in patients treated with LEF + LIG than in those treated with LEF (0.34 +/- 0.20 vs 1.12 +/- 0.30, P < 0.05)., Conclusions: Our algorithm combines structure and target pathways into one model that predicted that the combination of LEF and LIG can reduce joint inflammation and attenuate bone erosion in RA patients. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply this paradigm to evaluate drug combination hypotheses."

Generalized osteoporosis is common in RA, at axial and appendicular skeleton and in females and males. Denosumab is a fully humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that targets the receptor activator of nuclear factor Œ∫B ligand (RANKL). Denosumab prevents the binding and activation of the RANK receptors on the osteoclasts and hence inhibits osteoclasts formation, activation, function and survival. Denosumab results in more rapid and greater reductions in bone remodeling and correspondingly greater increases in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at all skeletal sites. Denosumab was approved by FDA in June 2010 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. Denosumab (Prolia¬Æ) is also licensed in Hong Kong.
 A high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) capable of achieving an isotropic voxel size of 80Œºm at tolerable radiation doses (3ŒºSv) is available for the assessment of trabecular and cortical microarchitecture at the distal radius and tibia. This technique bears excellent precision for both density and microstructure measures. Denosumab's greater potency in suppressing bone remodeling and greater effect on areal BMD than alendronate, particularly at predominantly cortical sites such as the distal third of the radius, may reflect the differing mechanism of action of these drugs, which, in turn, influence bone microarchitecture.
 The aim of this study is to compare the effects of denosumab and a current standard treatment on cortical and trabecular microarchitecture at the radius and second metacarpal in RA patients with low bone mineral density using HR-pQCT during a 6-month open-label randomized controlled study. One bisphosphonate, namely alendronate sodium (or alendronate) is chosen to generate a heterogeneous and comparable active control group. This is a 6-month open-label randomized controlled clinical trial. Forty ambulatory Chinese females, who consent to receive alendronate as standard treatment subjective to the randomization, will be enrolled from the rheumatology clinic of the Prince of Wales Hospital in this study. Subjects will be randomized to 2 groups receiving: 1) subcutaneous injection of denosumab 60mg (Prolia¬Æ) every 6 months (n=20), or 2) a standard treatment: oral alendronate weekly (Fosamax¬Æ once weekly 70 mg, n=20). In addition, all patients will be given a daily calcium supplement (1500mg caltrate /day) and 1 multivitamin tablet per day. Efficacy and safety assessment will be performed at baseline, month 3 and month 6. aBMD of lumbar spine, total hip and non-dominant distal radius will be measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and microarchitecture of bone is measured at the non-dominant distal radius and the second metacarpal bone of the non-dominant hand using HR-pQCT."

Although this treatment has been shown to be effective in many patients, up to 40% of patients do not achieve disease control. Drug concentration in plasma may be a factor affecting the observed variability in therapeutic response. In this study, we aimed to identify the plasma concentrations of the anti-TNF certolizumab pegol (CZP), associated with improvement in disease activity in patients with RA. Data were pooled from three randomized, controlled clinical trials with a combined total of 1,935 patients analyzed. Clinical outcomes of low disease activity (LDA) and remission were defined as Disease Activity Score in 28 joints with C-reactive protein (DAS28(CRP)) <= 2.7 and < 2.3, respectively. Quartile analysis results indicated that there may be an exposure-response relationship between CZP concentration and LDA/remission outcomes at weeks 12 and 24; the association was strongest for LDA (P < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that CZP concentrations >= 28.0 mug/ml at week 12, and >= 17.6 mug/ml at week 24, were associated with a greater likelihood of achieving LDA/remission outcomes. Although confirmatory studies are warranted to define the optimal CZP therapeutic range at weeks 12 and 24, these data indicate that CZP concentrations may be associated with improvement of disease activity.Copyright ¬¨¬© 2020 The Authors.

Preoperative, 1-month and 3-month postoperative data was collected retrospectively. In addition, included patients attended a prospective visit 12 months or later after surgery. The examination included: monocular uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), subjective refraction, slit-lamp examination, optical biometry, intraocular pressure (IOP), endothelial cell count and postoperative complications., RESULTS: 282 eyes, including 94 with pre-existing ocular pathologies, were analysed. Twelve months after the surgery, 95% of eyes achieved monocular CDVA equal or better than 0.3 logMAR, mean postoperative CDVA was 0.06 +/- 0.17 logMAR, and mean UDVA 0.31 +/- 0.29 logMAR. Visual acuity outcomes were better in eyes with no pre-existing ocular pathologies, but both groups showed a statistically significant improvement after surgery compared with preoperative values (p <= 0.002).

We determined the frequency of -238 G/A TNF-a gene polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. We measured the serum level of TNF-a using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Also, we determined the association of serum TNF-a level with the polymorphism in RA patients., Results: There was no significant difference in terms of sex and age in the two groups. In the RA group, the genotype frequency of -238 G/A polymorphism was GG (76.6%), GA (17.8%), and AA (5.6%). In the control group, the genotype frequency of -238 G/A polymorphism was GG (83.5%), GA (8.8%), and AA (7.7%). Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the genotype frequency of this polymorphism between two groups (p=0.07). The serum level of TNF-a were 5.21+/-1.69 Pg/mL (range 0 to 11.6) in the control group and 62.4+/-27.1 Pg/mL (range 0 to 117.22) in the RA group (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in terms of serum TNF-a level and different genotypes in the RA group (p=0.5)., Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the TNF-a -238 G/A gene polymorphism may not represent a significant risk factor for RA in Iranian population and there is no association between the polymorphism and serum TNF-a level in RA patients."

Overall reporting rates were calculated and patient case details were summarized. As of 17 November 2015, there were nine confirmed PML cases among patients who had received rituximab for RA and two for GPA.

Mean arrested caries were 0.6 and 0.7 surfaces for fluoride and placebo groups respectively and that of root caries were 0.3 and 0.1 surfaces (p > 0.05). The mean oral Candida count was reduced by 30 % in the fluoride group but increased 61 % in the placebo group while no change in oral lactobacilli counts in both groups at 24 months (p > 0.05). SS patients receiving fluoride varnish were significantly less likely to develop dentin caries (p < 0.05). In contrast, those with high baseline DMFS scores (p = 0.05), harbored mixed Candida species (p < 0.05), or unstimulated whole saliva at low pH (p< 0.01) were significantly more likely to develop dentin caries. Conclusions: results of this randomized clinical trial did not provide clear evidence to support or refute that quarterly applications of fluoride varnish can prevent development of dental caries in people with Sj√∂gren's syndrome"

Patients underwent a standardized neuropsychological battery (NEUROPSI). Sleep quality, fatigue, depression, and anxiety levels were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 60 patients with AAV were included, median age of 54 years, and disease duration of 5.6 years. Prevalence of cognitive dysfunction (CD) in AAV patients was similar to RA and CKD (35%, 40%, and 39.3%, respectively, p = .88). When AAV patients with (n = 21) and without (n = 39) CD were compared, significantly more patients with CD had high disease activity (67% vs. 31%, p = .009). Abnormal performance was more frequent in the executive functions in the three groups (45% AAV, 51.7% RA, and 50% CKD), followed by language (25%, 13.8%, and 25%, respectively). Verbal and visual attentional tests were more frequently impaired in patients from the CKD group (p = .021), and psychomotor functions were more frequently affected in AAV patients (p < .05). Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total score (especially anxiety) was higher in patients with memory impairment than in those with normal memory function (M = 6.79, SD = 4.53 vs. M = 4.5, SD = 3.6, p < .01). Neither Sleep Quality Index nor fatigue scale scores differed between those cognitively impaired and not impaired., CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of CD among the three clinical populations.

rheumatoid arthritis. This paper compares the effects of anakinra, a recombinant
human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, with those of etanercept and infliximab,
two drugs that target tumor necrosis factor-alpha. A Medline search identified
controlled clinical trials that included radiographic progression as an endpoint.
Anakinra 30 to 150 mg subcutaneously each day for 24 weeks was significantly more
effective than placebo in slowing progression of erosion, joint-space narrowing,
and total composite scores, as assessed by the Genant method, and erosive joint
count, as assessed by the Larsen method. Erosion scores were slowed even further
during a 24-week extension. Etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously twice weekly and
infliximab 3 to 10 mg/kg intravenously every 4 or 8 weeks also slowed progressive
joint damage, but these agents were studied under different study designs,
patient populations, and radiographic assessments than those used in the anakinra
study. Despite these differences, however, each biologic therapy appeared to slow
progressive joint damage. In some studies, control of clinical symptoms did not
correlate with slowing of radiographic progression. Agents that block
interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha appear similarly effective in
slowing radiographic progression in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.
Treatment strategies for this disease may need to consider clinical symptoms,
progressive joint damage, and long-term safety effects separately."

We aimed to investigate the effects of tocilizumab treatment on body weight and serum adipokine levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)., METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated weight changes in patients with RA who received methotrexate (Cohort I) or tocilizumab with methotrexate (Cohorts II and III) for 24 weeks. Adipokine concentrations at baseline and 24 weeks were analyzed in Cohorts I and III. Cohorts I and II received tocilizumab therapy for an additional 48 weeks, during which weight changes were monitored (24-72 weeks)., RESULTS: No significant weight change occurred after 24 weeks of methotrexate treatment (mean difference, -0.2 kg; P = 0.630), but was observed after 24 weeks of tocilizumab treatment (mean difference, +0.9 kg; P = 0.010). Weight changed regardless of the treatment response in both treatment groups. The leptin-adiponectin ratio (P = 0.015) and levels of adiponectin (P < 0.001), leptin (P < 0.001), and resistin (P = 0.003) increased significantly after 24 weeks of tocilizumab, but not methotrexate treatment. After 24, 48 and 72 weeks of tocilizumab treatment in Cohort II, mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) weight changes from baseline were +0.7 (0.0-1.4), +1.2 (0.4-2.0) and +1.1 (0.2-2.0) kg, respectively, and mean (95% CI) percent weight changes from baseline were +1.3% (0.1%-2.6%), +2.2% (0.7%-3.6%), and +2.0% (0.4%-3.7%) at 24, 48, and 72 weeks, respectively., CONCLUSION: Weight and the leptin-adiponectin ratio increased after tocilizumab treatment.

We aimed to study pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to BPs during pregnancy., METHODS: Data for cases and controls were from the French Reference Centre of Teratogenic Agents. Cases were women who received BPs in the 6 weeks before or during a pregnancy and had systemic or bone diseases. We included two respectively matched control groups: women with systemic diseases not exposed to BPs and healthy women not exposed to BPs or any teratogenic agent. Four controls were assigned to each case., RESULTS: Thirty-six women were exposed to BPs including 5 just before pregnancy and 30 during the first trimester; 23 had systemic diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, n = 5; rheumatoid arthritis, n = 5; other, n = 13) and 13 had bone diseases.

In this paper, we analysed whether a treat-to-target (T2T) strategy optimizing csDMARD, oral, and IA-GC treatment as an adjunct new therapy to a new certolizumab pegol (CZP) therapy improves the effectivity in RA patients. Methods: 43 patients with active RA (‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢6 tender, ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢6 swollen joints, ESR ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 20 mm/h or CRP ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 7mg/L) despite csDMARD treatment for ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 3 months and na‚àö√òve to bDMARDs were randomized to CZP (200 mg/2 weeks after loading with 400 mg at weeks 0‚Äö√Ñ√¨2‚Äö√Ñ√¨4) plus a treat-to-target strategy (T2T, n = 21), or to CZP added to the established csDMARD therapy (fixed regimen, n = 22). The T2T strategy consisted of changing the baseline csDMARD therapy (1) SC-methotrexate (dose: 15 ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 20 ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ 25 mg/week, depending on the initial dose) ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ leflunomide (20 mg/d) ‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢ sulphasalazine (2 ‚àö√≥ 1000 mg/d) plus (2) oral GCs (prednisolone 20‚Äö√Ñ√¨15‚Äö√Ñ√¨12.5‚Äö√Ñ√¨10‚Äö√Ñ√¨7.5‚Äö√Ñ√¨5‚Äö√Ñ√¨2.5‚Äö√Ñ√¨0 mg/d tapered every five days) and (3) injections of ‚Äö√¢¬ß5 affected joints with triamcinolone. DMARD modification and an addition of oral GCs were initiated, depending on the achievement of low disease activity (DAS 28 < 3.2). The primary objective was defined as the ACR 50 response at week 24. Results: ACR 50 was achieved in 76.2% of the T2T, as compared to 36.4% of the fixed regimen patients (p = 0.020). ACR 20 and 70 responses were achieved in 90.5% and 71.4% of the T2T patients and 59.1% and 27.3% of the fixed regimen patients, respectively (p = 0.045 and p = 0.010, respectively).

Introduction: To evaluate the effect of once-monthly oral MIN in patients with RA, a prospective, randomized, open-label, head-to-head comparison with once-monthly oral RIS was conducted. Methods: A total of 83 patients with RA were randomly assigned to either once-monthly oral MIN 50 mg (n = 42) or once-monthly oral RIS 75 mg (n = 41). Serial BMD and bone turnover markers were measured and compared between the treatment groups. Results: BMD (lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck) increased significantly after 12 months of treatment with MIN (3.8, 2.0, and 2.2%, respectively, P < 0.05) and RIS (3.6, 1.9, and 1.9%, respectively, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the treatment groups. Percent changes of bone turnover markers from baseline to 12 months in the MIN group were significantly greater than those in the RIS group (TRACP-5b: - 36.3 vs - 19.3%, P < 0.05; NTX: - 27.1 vs - 17.3%, P < 0.05; BAP: -30.2 vs -19.4%, P < 0.05).

9737486,,10.1620/tjem.251.9,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic articular and bone manifestations and its pathogenesis is driven by a complex network of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-6. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been standardized by the introduction of a treat-to-target approach. Subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ-SC) is a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, and is widely used for refractory RA patients in the clinical settings. However, it remains unknown whether TCZ-SC shows effectiveness for elderly onset RA. The study was aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of TCZ-SC in elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) patients in daily practice. Fifty-five RA patients were divided into two age groups upon TCZ-SC administration: young (Y) group (< 65 years old, n = 30) and elderly-onset (EO) group (> 65 years old, n = 25). Disease activity score-28 (DAS28) upon TCZ-SC administration (4.84 in EO group vs. 4.41 in Y group) was significantly decreased to 1.94 vs. 1.93 at 3 months and 1.61 vs. 1.75 at 12 months after administration. The clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) rate was 75% in EO group vs. 83% in Y group at 3 months and 90% vs. 85% at 12 months.

The authors of the study hypothesize that RA would increase the rate of medical- and implant-related complications, readmission rates, and costs. A retrospective level of evidence III study was conducted using the Medicare standard analytical files from the PearlDiver database. Patients were queried using the International Classification of Disease, ninth revision codes. Patients with RA were randomly matched 1:1 to controls according to age, gender, and Charlson's comorbidity index. Two mutually exclusive cohorts were formed. Medical- and implant-related complications, readmission rates, and costs were analyzed and compared between the cohorts. Statistical analysis using logistic regression was performed calculating odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and their respective p-values. The query returned 102,898 patients with (n = 51,449) and without (n = 51,449) RA undergoing primary TKA within the Medicare database from 2005 to 2014. Patients with RA had greater odds of medical complications (OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.98-2.20, p < 0.001), implant complications (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.24-1.36, p < 0.001), 1-year mortality (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 0.68-2.70, p = 0.39), total 90-day episode-of-care costs ($16,605 vs. 15,716.53; p < 0.001), and 90-day readmission rates were similar between cohorts (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.05-1.12, p < 0.001).

This DTI study aims to evaluate the potential microstructural changes of the brain in RA patients receiving anti-TNFa treatment. Methods Nineteen patients with newly diagnosed RA (10 female and 9 male; mean age +/- SD; 53 +/- 6.6 years) were included in this study. All patients had detailed physical examination and completed a short period of therapy with methotrexate and/or corticosteroids. A baseline brainMRI including FLAIR, T1, T2 and DTI was performed and a follow up after 12 months of treatment with anti-TNFa. MRI scans revealed no obvious changes in follow up examinations. During this period all patients were immunoneurologic free. Histogram metrics of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of gray matter and white matter compared before and after treatment. Result Mean, median, mode, and 75th percentile of the FA distribution for both grey (GM) and white matter (WM) decreased after treatment. Standard deviation of GMs FA distribution also decreased after treatment. Histogram metrics of the MD distribution ofWM and GM did not reveal significant changes. Discussion & Conclusion Histogram analysis reveals microstructural changes in patients with RA under antiTNFa treatment. Hypomyelination with relative axonal preservation might be the anatomical substrate of decreased FA in WM. Activation of TNFa in RA is considered an important factor for GM atrophy. AntiTNFa treatment waives TNFa activity and leads to increased cellularity expressed as decreased FA."

This study aims to determine whether an e-health intervention that incorporates symptom/disease activity monitoring and physical activity counselling can improve self-management ability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: the 'Empowering active self-management of arthritis: raising the bar with OPERAS (an On-demand Program to EmpoweR Active Self-management)' project is a randomized controlled trial that uses a delayed control design. One hundred thirty-four participants with RA will be randomly assigned to start the intervention either immediately (immediate group) or 6 months later (delayed group). The intervention involves (1) use of a Fitbit-compatible web app to record and monitor their RA disease activity, symptoms, and time spent on physical activity and a Fitbit; (2) group education and individual counselling by a physiotherapist (PT); and (3) six phone calls with a PT. The primary outcome measure is self-management ability measured by the Patient Activation Measure. Secondary outcome measures include disease status, fatigue, pain, depressive symptoms, and characteristics of habitual behavior and also time spent in physical activity and sedentary activity with a wearable multi-sensor device (SenseWear Mini). After the 6-month intervention, we will interview a sample of participants to examine their experiences with the intervention. Discussion: the results of this study will help to determine whether this technology-enhanced self-management intervention improves self-management ability and health outcomes for people living with RA. A limitation of this study is that participants will need to self-report their symptoms, disease status, and treatment use through questionnaires on the OPERAS web app. The user-friendly interface, reminder emails from the research staff, and tailored guidance from PTs will encourage participants to actively engage with the app. Trial registration: date of last update in ClinicalTrials.gov: january 2, 2019.

Patients were categorized in three levels of nursing support (intense, medium, or low). They filled in a non-validated and exploratory questionnaire about satisfaction, quality, and helpfulness of information., RESULTS: The nursing support was considered intense, medium, or low for 98 (82.4%), 10 (8.4%), and 11 (9.2%) patients, respectively. All disease activity scores improved versus baseline, and 90% of the patients qualified for treatment prolongation without major differences between nursing level groups.

Satisfaction was high in all three nursing support groups., CONCLUSIONS: This prospective open-label study has confirmed the short-term effectiveness of golimumab in three rheumatological diseases, with most of the patients qualifying for reimbursement renewal. The limited sample size and the fact that the vast majority of patients benefited from an intense nursing support did not allow drawing definite conclusions concerning the impact of the nursing level on the treatment effectiveness and changes in the disease activity. Nurses seem however to play a crucial role in this short-term study but this remains to be confirmed in a longer-term study."

An open-label, crossover, pharmacokinetic study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability and safety of YLB113 and the etanercept reference product (RP) Enbrel R., METHODS: Healthy male subjects aged 18-50 years were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of YLB113 in one period and the etanercept RP in another period. A washout period of 28 days separated the two treatment periods. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis predose and until 480 h postdose during both periods., RESULTS: Overall, 52 subjects were enrolled, including 51 subjects who completed the first period and 43 subjects who completed the second period. The 90% confidence intervals for the least squares means derived from an analysis of the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters maximum serum concentration (Cmax), area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC(0-t)) and AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-)) for etanercept were between the limits of 80 and 125%. Thus, YLB113 met the bioequivalence criterion. YLB113 and the etanercept RP were well tolerated, with 24 subjects reporting 53 adverse events, including 42 mild and 11 moderate events. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 14 and 16 subjects following the administration of YLB113 and the etanercept RP, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of YLB113 exhibited pharmacokinetic and safety profiles comparable with those of the etanercept RP in healthy adult male subjects. Therefore, YLB113 and the etanercept RP can be considered bioequivalent. These findings support the continued development of YLB113 for use in patients with RA., JORDAN FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION UNIQUE TRIAL NUMBER: 31/Clinical/2018."

We conducted a randomized comparative trial to assess the efficacy of TJ-28 for preventing hand-foot syndrome (HFS) as a complication of adjuvant chemotherapy using capecitabine. Methods: the present study was a multi-institutional randomized-controlled trial (UMIN000005899). Colorectal cancer patients scheduled to receive capecitabine chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy were randomly assigned to receive TJ-28 (7500√Ç¬†mg/day) or oral pyridoxine (60√Ç¬†mg/day). Patients were monitored for the development of grade √¢‚Ä∞¬• 2 HFS according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria until chemotherapy completion. Results: twenty-two patients were enrolled in this study. The relative dose intensity of capecitabine was 76.2% in the TJ-28 group and 68.2% in the pyridoxine group. Grade √¢‚Ä∞¬• 2 HFS developed in 6 (50.0%) of 12 TJ-28 patients and in 4 (40.0%) of 10 pyridoxine patients. Chemotherapy treatment failure was observed in seven patients, mainly due to HFS, liver dysfunction, diarrhea, and neutropenia. Chemotherapy treatment failure due to HFS occurred in none of the TJ-28 group and 2 patients (20.0%) in the pyridoxine group (p = 0.114). Conclusion: capecitabine-associated HFS was not markedly prevented by TJ-28 compared with pyridoxine. However, TJ-28 might support the continuation of chemotherapy with capecitabine. Further studies are warranted to clarify the benefits of TJ-28"

Meanwhile, it seems that TNF inhibitors in ankylosing spondylitis may present a better safety profile than we thought. Objective The aim of our study was to retrospectively investigate the occurrence of adverse events in ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with TNF inhibitors. Setting A single referral center in Poland. Methods Detailed medical history of ankylosing spondylitis patients was obtained during the interview with the patient and by reviewing electronic medical records. Patients treated with TNF inhibitors and patients without TNF inhibitors treatment were compared. Main outcome measure The incidence of adverse events during the 3 months period before the interview. Results A total of 150 patients, 103 in the treatment group and 47 in the control group, were included in the study. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, infections and opportunistic infections between both groups. However, in the treatment group, noninfectious adverse events were significantly less frequent than in control group (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.66), with abdominal pain as the most common noninfectious adverse event (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07-0.63). The differences in incidence rates of specific infections were not significant, except acute infectious diarrhea which also was less frequent in patients treated with TNF inhibitors (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.85). The female gender was significantly associated with any adverse event occurrence (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.15-4.83). Conclusion TNF inhibitors show a good safety profile in ankylosing spondylitis patients."

Prescribing NSAIDs which have a lower risk of major adverse effects as the first-line NSAID for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis may be expected to lead to an improvement in clinical outcomes and reduce overall treatment costs. This analysis examines data from a published randomised controlled trial of 5 NSAIDs to explore these hypotheses. Design and Setting: Data from a clinical trial comparing 5 NSAIDs were combined with published cost data to construct 2 clinical decision models, reflecting alternative approaches to the management of major and minor adverse effects in the UK. Interventions: The 5 NSAIDs evaluated in the analysis were nabumetone, diclofenac, ibuprofen, piroxicam and naproxen, although only the results for ibuprofen and nabumetone are reported. Main outcome measures and results: The total cost of care per patient receiving nabumetone was estimated to be between 25 pounds sterling (L) and (L)41 more expensive than ibuprofen. In a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 patients, there were between 690 and 821 more major adverse effects using ibuprofen than nabumetone. The cost per life-year gained (LYG) from using nabumetone rather than ibuprofen ranged between (L)1880 and (L)2517 (1995 values), depending upon the management of adverse effects. Conclusions: These results indicate that: (i) prescribing the newer, currently more expensive, NSAIDs will not necessarily lead to cost savings; (ii) the management of adverse effects can have a significant impact on costs; and (iii) the additional cost may be justifiable in terms of the mortality and morbidity gains associated with the new lower-risk NSAIDs."

Each participant then selected the three most important elements from the generated list. The results of each group were then combined and summarized., Results: Twenty-five rheumatologists participated in 4 groups (group size ranged from 4 to 8) and 150 available ranking votes across all groups. The statements generated across the 4 groups were categorized into 13 topics (including symptoms, physical function, comorbidities, social aspects, physical findings, response to treatment, treatment adherence, pain management, side effects, tests, access to care, contraception, and organ involvement), 10 of which received ranking votes. Symptoms received the highest ranking (46% of votes), followed by physical function (16%), and physical findings (13%). Among the unranked topics, social aspects had the highest number of statements (8 statements)., Conclusion: Rheumatologists highly valued patient-reported RA symptoms and physical function to inform their treatment decisions, even above objective data such as physical findings and test results. These results can guide the selection of validated PRO measures to assess these domains to inform the clinical care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis."
9737580,,10.55563/clinexprheumatol/xn5i2y,"INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a symmetric polyarthritis. One of the cytokines playing a role in RA is interleukin-6 (IL-6)(1;2). Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and is proved to be effective in reducing inflammation and symptoms in RA. Tocilizumab intravenously (IV) is approved by the European Medical agency (EMA) in a standard dose of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks for RA patients. The FDA approved a standard dose of 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks, with a possibility to increase the dose to 8 mg/kg. This raises the question whether a proportion of patients treated with 8 mg/kg are overexposed.
 Previously, it has been showed that 8 mg/kg results in a wide range of serum tocilizumab concentrations, although serum concentrations above 1 mg/L are reported to be sufficient to inhibit IL-6 signaling and to normalize CRP levels (CRP ‚Äö√¢¬ß 10 mg/L), suggesting a systemic IL-6R blockade (3;4). In a previous study, the median tocilizumab concentration was 10.6 mg/L after 24 weeks of treatment, suggesting that a substantial proportion of patients is likely to be overexposed to tocilizumab (4). A recent study showed that overexposure, defined by high serum drug concentration, can be reduced in adalimumab-treated RA patients by prolonging the dose-interval (5). The wide variation in tocilizumab concentrations and sufficient target blockade at a fixed serum trough concentration suggests that a similar approach to reduce overexposure is possible in tocilizumab treatment too. Moreover, Levi and colleagues showed improvements in the disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28) were associated with a C50 (concentration at which the 50% of the effect is achieved) between 2-5 ¬¨¬µg/ml. (8) We, therefore, expect that patients can reduce the dose aiming at a concentration of 5 mg/L without reducing efficacy. Around 70% of the patients had a tocilizumab concentration above 5 mg/L in a previous study and can potentially reduce the dose (3).
 Reducing overexposure is necessary in light of high drug costs and, possibly, the risk of adverse events. Therefore, our aim is to study whether overexposure can be reduced without affecting disease activity in tocilizumab-treated RA patients. We have developed an algorithm to reduce the dose in order to achieve a tocilizumab concentration of 5 mg/L in each patient.
 OBJECTIVES Primary objective: to evaluate the feasibility of reducing the dose of tocilizumab according to serum trough levels at baseline, after 20 weeks follow-up.
 Secondary objective: to evaluate the dose-reduction algorithm in tocilizumab-treated RA patients with tocilizumab concentrations above 5 mg/L after 20 weeks of follow-up.
 STUDY DESIGN Double-blind randomized controlled pilot study in RA patients treated with tocilizumab IV every four weeks for at least 24 weeks. Patients will receive their tocilizumab infusion at the outpatient clinic of the department of Rheumatology in Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical center. The treatment will be at the discretion of treating rheumatologist; patients can receive tocilizumab treatment as monotherapy or in combination with concomitant DMARD therapy or prednisone. After given informed consent, tocilizumab trough concentration will be determined and those patients with concentration above 5 mg/L will be randomly assigned (2: 1 ratio) to dose reduction or to continuation of their tocilizumab dose. Patients with concentrations below 5 mg/L will continue the dose they received at the screening visit. All included patients will have a follow up of 20 weeks independent of the tocilizumab concentration, treatment arm or medication adjustments. Clinical data are collected at the baseline visit and at 12, and 20 weeks thereafter. Blood samples are collected every infusion, namely at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks thereafter.
 The study visit will take place at the same day of the tocilizumab infusion. After performing the clinical/ laboratory assessments and infusion at 20 weeks of follow up, the allocation will be revealed. This allows the treating rheumatologist, in consultation with the patient, to decide whether to continue with the dose given during the study phase or to change the dose.
 Intervention Those patients with tocilizumab concentration above 5 mg/L, that are assigned to the intervention group, will reduce the tocilizumab dose at the baseline visit. A dose-reduction algorithm is developed, using a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model, to calculate the dose needed for each patient to achieve a tocilizumab concentration of 5 mg/L (range 4-6 mg/L). As is shown in Table 1, the dose-reduction is dependent of the tocilizumab concentration measured at the screenings visit. Patients are followed for 20 weeks to evaluate the serum concentration after several infusions.

 5. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 5.1 Investigational treatment Those patients that are allocated to the intervention group will reduce the dose at the baseline visit (week 0) and maintain that dose till 20 weeks of follow-up. The reduced dose is dependent of the tocilizumab serum concentration, measured at the screening visit, and is calculated according to the dose-reduction algorithm (as described in the ""study design"").
 5.2 Escape medication Treatment can be changed in case of flare (defined in subheading ""flare criteria"" in study procedures). In this case, the original dose is given to the patient, without unblinding the patients and treating rheumatologist. If the flare persists after 4 weeks, treatment will be adjusted in consultation with the treating rheumatologist. This includes; increasing DMARDs or NSAIDs dosage, adding glucocorticoids or switching to another biologic/anti-rheumatic drug. If the patient or physician wants to reinstate the original dose, but the flare criteria are not met, this will be logged as protocol violation.
 6. METHODS 6.1 Randomisation, blinding and treatment allocation Randomization allocation ratio will be 2: 1 (therapeutic drug monitoring versus standard care). Randomization procedure: block randomization with variable block sizes (2 to 4 per block) generated by an online program. Variable blocks are used to ensure that the allocation of participants will not be predictable when the treating rheumatologist and participant are unblinded after the study. During the study, patients, physicians, nurses and researchers are blinded for drug concentrations and treatment allocation. The infusions for the study will be prepared by the, designated departmental nurse based on the randomization number. The physical appearance of the medication will be the same to enable blinding of participating patients and study staff. Allocation concealment: randomization list is an excel document managed by an independent co-worker of Reade and a backup independent co-worker.
 Study procedures At screening patients will be checked for eligibility, informed consent will be signed and, afterwards, tocilizumab concentration will be determined. The assessments listed below will be performed at baseline (week 0), and 12 and 20 weeks thereafter. Blood samples are collected every infusion, namely at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks thereafter. In case of a (suspected) flare, an extra visit will be planned to perform the same assessments as during the regular visits Disease activity and functioning Swollen and tender joint count of 66/68 joints, patient pain visual analogue score(VAS) (0-100 scale), physician global VAS (0-100 scale), patient global disease activity VAS (0-100 scale). Functional status will be assessed with the simplified Health Assessment Questionnaire (sHAQ), which is included in the routine assessment of patient index data 3 (RAPID-3). DAS28-ESR, SDAI and CDAI will be calculated every visit.
 Safety Patients will be asked for (serious) adverse events (AEs) during the past 3 months. This will be recorded by the examiner on an already designated questionnaire form. Nature, seriousness, duration, localization and consequences of the events will be recorded.
 Laboratory investigations Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), complete blood count (Hb, Ht, white cell count, platelets), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) will be measured. Blood samples for serum (5 ml) are collected prior to each infusion and 15 minutes afterwards, in order to measure the tocilizumab concentration at trough and at peak moment, respectively. Tocilizumab concentrations (except screening samples) are measured in one batch at the end of the study.
 Other variables Other variables recorded at baseline are: age, gender, duration of disease, immunoglobulin M (IgM) rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide status, presence of erosive disease, length and weight, current medication, medication history regarding DMARD and NSAID therapy, prednisone and biological use. Patients perspective towards therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and current study procedures will be asked and noted during the first and final visit.
 Flare criteria A flare is defined as an increase in DAS28 between visits of >1.2 (or >0.6 if current DAS28‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢3.2) and/or DMARDs is increased, or a DMARD and/or triamcinolone treatment is added (both intramuscular or intra-articular). Clinical and laboratory assessment will be performed at the moment a patient is examined for a flare.
 Medication: current medication use will be asked for each visit, with special attention to changes in DMARD or NSAID therapy and the use of glucocorticoids. It is aimed to leave all rheumatic co-medication unaltered during the study period. However, changes in use of paracetamol (acetaminophen), tramadol, NSAIDs, oral glucocorticoids, methylprednisone (Depo-medrol), triamcinolone (kenacort) and DMARDs are allowed during this study if a recent DAS28-score is reported. During each visit, patients are asked about the use of these medications. Changes in co-medication are left to the discretion of the treating rheumatologist, but treatment alterations without recent DAS28 score will be logged as protocol violations.
 6.2 Follow-up of subjects withdrawn from treatment Follow up of patients withdrawn from treatment will be part of the study. Patients will be asked to complete 20 weeks follow-up.
 6.3 Premature termination of the study The study will be prematurely terminated if safety of patients can no longer be guaranteed."

9737592,,10.55563/clinexprheumatol/nlr4r8,"OBJECTIVES: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors like certolizumab, elicit an immunogenic response leading to the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). We sought to mechanistically investigate the relationship between certolizumab concentrations, ADAs, and the effective TNF neutralising capacity in sera of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. TNF neutralising capacity of certolizumab was compared to the neutralising capacity of adalimumab., METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 40 consecutive certolizumab-treated RA patients at baseline and 4, 16, 28 and 52 weeks after treatment initiation [Dutch Trial Register NTR (Nederlands Trial Register) Trial NL2824 no. 2965]. Certolizumab concentration and ADA titre were measured with a certolizumab bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a drug-tolerant radioimmunoassay (RIA), respectively. TNF neutralisation by certolizumab and adalimumab, in presence or absence of ADAs, was analysed with the TNF-sensitive WEHI bioassay., RESULTS: Despite a high incidence of ADAs during one year of follow-up (65%; 26/40 patients), certolizumab levels of >10 mug/ml were measured in most patients. The capacity for TNF neutralisation highly correlated with certolizumab serum concentration, whereas no association with ADAs was observed. Similar results were obtained for adalimumab. The relative in vitro neutralising potency was higher for certolizumab compared to adalimumab., CONCLUSIONS: Anti-certolizumab antibodies were detected in a large proportion of patients, but in most cases where ADAs were detected, certolizumab was also present in high concentrations, directly correlating with in vitro neutralising capacity. These results indicate that measurement of certolizumab drug levels, rather than ADAs, have direct clinical significance."

Rheumatoid arthritis is the major cause of AA amyloidosis in Western Europe and North America. The most common clinical feature of AA amyloidosis is renal dysfunction manifested as nephrotic-range proteinuria or renal insufficiency at the time of diagnosis. End-stage renal failure is the cause of death in 40-60% of cases. Gastrointestinal involvement is also frequent and is usually manifested as chronic diarrhea, body weight loss and malabsorption. Enlargement of the liver and spleen may also occur in some patients. The median survival time from diagnosis varies from 2 to 8 years depending on the stage of the disease at time of diagnosis. The goal of the current therapy in AA amyloidosis is the control of the associated disease. However, the current approaches for the treatment of AA amyloidosis are unspecific, toxic, invasive, and not sufficiently effective in many cases. NC-503 was specifically designed to compete with the naturally occurring sulfated GAGs for the binding to amyloidogenic precursor proteins, and to inhibit amyloid deposition into tissues. The proposed therapy with NC-503 is based on the prevention of the amyloid fibril formation. The objective of this clinical phase II/III study is to determine the efficacy and safety of NC-503 compared to a placebo in patients suffering from secondary (AA) amyloidosis by the assessment of clinical improvement/ worsening of both renal and gastrointestinal functions."

Exclusion criteria were previous surgery, rheumatic arthritis, elbow instability, radicular symptoms, higher-grade extensor tendon rupture, or cervical osteoarthritis. The clinical evaluation was performed after 12 weeks and 12 months. The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) scale, Placzek Score, the pain rating (VAS), range of motion and the Subjective Elbow Score were evaluated. Results: of the initially 61 patients, 31 were followed up after 12 weeks and 22 after 12 months. Twenty-nine patients (43%) were male, the mean age was 46, and 44 patients (66%) had the right elbow involved. At 12 weeks, there was a pain reduction on the VAS in both groups (PT + O: 6.5-3.7 [p =.001]; PT: 4.7-4.1 [p =.468]), albeit it was only significant for the PT + O group. At 12 months, reduction was significant in both groups (PT + O: 1.1 [p =.000]; PT: 1.3 [p =.000]). The painless maximum hand strength in kg improved in both groups significant after 3 and 12 months. The Placzek score was reduced from 8.25 to 3.5 [p =.001] after 12 weeks for the PT + O group and from 8.1 to 3.8 [p =.000] in the PT group, as well as after 12 months in the PT + O group to 0 [p =.000] and in the PT group to 2.0 [p =.000]. The PRTEE improved in both groups after 12 weeks (PT + O: 52.8 - 31.3 [p =.002]; PT: 48.6-37.6 [p =.185]) and 12 months (PT + O: 16.15 [p =.000]; PT: 16.6 [p =.000]), although the reduction at 12 weeks was not significant for the PT group. Conclusion: the elbow orthosis appears to accelerate the healing process with respect to the PRTEE and pain on the VAS (12 weeks follow-up), although there is an adjustment after 12 months in both groups and a significant improvement of symptoms is achieved in all endpoints.

Objectives: to determine whether spa therapy plus pharmacological treatment offers any benefit in the management of RA AS compared to pharmacological treatment alone. Methods: we conducted a prospective, controlled, unblinded randomly assigned study of patients with RA according to american college of rheumatology criteria. Following the 2007 recommendations of AFRETH, the method designed for this study was ""immediate treatment versus delayed treatment."" All patients were followed at the oporto hospital centre and each physician observed the same patients throughout the study. Patients continued with their usual medications and maintained their daily life activities at home, at leisure and/ or in the workplace. The spa therapy group received spa treatments for 21 days at S. Jorge spa-santa maria da feira. The main outcome measure was the HAQ-DI; the moderated regression analysis, together with the johnson-neyman technique, was used for statistical analysis. Results: hAQ-DI at the end of treatment (21 days) and at the 3 month follow-up was improved in the spa group (odds ratio 0.37, confidence interval 0.09-0.64, p = 0.01 at 21 days, and 0.44, 0.15-0.72, p = 0.004 at 3 months). Conclusions: in individuals in whom pain (physical and psychological) predominates, any complementary gain in function is beneficial. The main goal is to enhance quality of life.

The ACR20 and ACR50 response rates were, respectively, 56-72% and 35-46% for sarilumab, 58% and 30% for adalimumab, and 33-34% and 15-18% for placebo. DAS28 remission rates were 20-34% for sarilumab, 7% for adalimumab, and 7-10% for placebo. Sarilumab has a higher risk for neutropenia than tocilizumab, the other IL-6 inhibitor, but a lower risk for dyslipidemia, injection site reactions, and gastrointestinal perforation. The acquisition costs of sarilumab are expected to be similar to those of most other biologic DMARDs., CONCLUSION: Sarilumab is an alternative to biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs in patients with moderate to severely active RA who have not responded adequately to prior conventional synthetic DMARDs or tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors."

Bisphosphonates, the recently developed bone resorption inhibitors, have demonstrated significant therapeutic effects on senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid (ZOL), with or without methotrexate (MTX), for the prevention and treatment of bone destruction in RA patients., METHODS: We recruited 66 RA patients with symptoms of secondary osteoporosis. They were randomized into three treatment groups-combined treatment with MTX and ZOL, ZOL monotherapy, or MTX monotherapy-in two consecutive 6-month periods. The participants were followed for 12 months. At the end of each treatment period, improvement in disease activity, bone destruction, and fracture risk were evaluated., RESULTS: Combined treatment with ZOL and MTX had significantly better clinical efficacy compared with either ZOL or MTX monotherapy (P < 0.05). The combination significantly improved the lumbar spine and hip BMD and reduced FRAX scores, suggesting that ZOL combined with MTX reduces bone loss and risk of hip fracture in RA patients with secondary osteoporosis., CONCLUSION: ZOL has a synergistic effect when combined with MTX, inhibiting RA disease activity, reducing fracture risk, and improving quality of life in RA patients with secondary osteoporosis., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1800019290.

Methods Totally 72 early RA patients with DGPS were assigned to the treatment group and the control group according to random digit table, 36 in each group. Patients in the control group took MTX, while those in the treatment group additionally took HF. MTX dose was increased from 7. 5 mg to 12. 5 mg gradually, once per week, and the course of treatment was 24 weeks. Efficacy for Chinese medicine (CM) syndromes, ACR20 improvement rate, laboratory re- lated indices [ rheumatoid factor ( RF ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , C-reactive protein (CRP) , anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP)], serum levels of MMP-3, OPG, RANKL, and adverse reactions were observed. Results The standard arriving rate of ACR20 was 82. 86% (2935) in the treatment group, higher than that in the control group [51. 52% (173) ;P <0. 05). The effective rate of CM syndrome was 85. 7% (30f35) in the treatment group, higher than that in the control group [63. 6% (21/33) ;P <0. 05). Compared with before treatment in the same group, levels of RF,ESR,CRP,MMP-3, and RANKL decreased, the OPG level increased in the two groups after treatment (P <0. 05, P <0. 01). Compared with the control group, levels of RF, ESR, CRP, and RANKL all decreased with statistical difference (P <0. 01 , P <0. 05). Liver dysfunction occurred in 1 case of the treatment group. Leucopenia occurred in 1 case and liver dysfunction occurred in 2 cases of the control group. Conclusion HF com- bined MTX could improve symptoms of early RA patients with DGPS, and regulate bone destruction in- duced by RANK/RANKL/OPG systems."

Patients and Methods: Randomized prospective clinical study of 16 outpatient rheumatology centers in the Slovak Republic were performed in 2008 and 2009 years. The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis has been confirmed by ACR (1986) diagnostic criteria. The diagnosis of osteoporosis was defined by WHO criteria (1994) using measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) by Dual Xray Absorptiometry (DXA). HRQoL has been assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire in the Slovak language, the activity of RA measured by DAS28 and physical disability by HAQ questionnaire. Statistical evaluation by the unpaired t-test. Results: Were examined 311 patients with RA (among them 260 women), mean age 55.63+/-11.84 years, mean duration of 13.67+/-9.66 years, rheumatoid factor positivity in 72% of patients, mean activity of RA (DAS28) was 5,36+/-1,31, median of physical disability measured by HAQ questionnaire 1,500 . Diffuse osteoporosis by WHO criteria has been confirmed in 113 patients with RA (36%). The mean age of osteoporosis patients was 61.27+/-9.78 years and mean duration of RA 17.61+/- 9.42 years. The physical component summary rate of SF-36 has been significantly reduced in patients with diffuse osteoporosis in RA compare to all patients with RA (27.86+/-19.23 versus 35.20+/-21.37, p<0,01) and the mental component summary rate of SF-36 has been also reduced in RA patients with osteoporosis (40.58+/-22.17 versus 49.77+/-22.38 p<0,01). Conclusion: Diffuse osteoporosis in patients with RA significantly reduce HRQoL in both summary components - physical health as well as mental health."

Patients receiving ABA (ABA group) were matched individually with patients receiving csDMARD and/or steroids (control group). Postoperative AE included surgical site infection, delayed wound healing, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, flare, and death. The incidence rates of the AE in both groups were compared with the Mantel-Haenszel test. Risk factors for AE were analyzed by logistic regression model., RESULTS: A total of 3358 cases were collected. After inclusion and exclusion, 2651 patients were selected for matching, and 194 patients in 97 pairs were chosen for subsequent comparative analyses between the ABA and control groups. No between-group differences were detected in the incidence rates of each AE or in the incidence rates of total AE (control vs ABA: 15.5% vs 20.7% in total, 5.2% vs 3.1% in death)., CONCLUSION: Compared with csDMARD and/or steroids without ABA, adding ABA to the treatment does not appear to increase the incidence rates of postoperative AE in patients with RA undergoing orthopedic surgery. Large cohort studies should be performed to add evidence for the perioperative safety profile of ABA."

Patients were divided into two groups: Group OA (273 knees of 206 patients; 83 males, 123 females; mean age: 64.4 (47-87) years) and Group RA (304 knees of 182 patients; 92 males, 90 females; mean age: 50.7 (21-72) years). In the clinical evaluation, the knee range of motion (ROM) and several outcome measures such as The Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were used preoperatively and at the final follow-up visit. The quality of life was measured using Short Form (SF)-36 MCS and PCS scores. The primary outcome was the frequency and severity of patient-reported AKP. The AKP Scale was used to determine the severity of AKP., RESULTS: The IKDC raised from 21.62 (range, 13-29.9) preoperatively to 85.1 (range, 80-88) for group OA and from 21.8 (range, 13-29.9) to 85.2 (range, 81-88) for group RA (p < 0.001). The mean KSS improved from 28.35 (range, 22-38) preoperatively to 90.04 (range, 88-95) for group OA and from 21.9 (range, 18-35) preoperatively to 89.7 (range, 86-95) for group RA. The mean WOMAC increased from 20.61 (range, 17.4-24.2) preoperatively to 95.7 (range, 90.9-97.7) for group OA (p < 0.001) and from 20.2 (range, 16.7-24.2) preoperatively to 95.8 (range, 90.9-98.5) for group RA (p < 0.001). The mean ROM improved from 80.14degree (range, 55degree-130degree) preoperatively to 113.17degree (range, 95degree-140degree) in group OA (P = 0.003) and from 73.4degree (range, 10degree-130degree) to 112.8degree (range 90degree-140degree) in group RA (P = 0.003) postoperatively. The frequency of AKP was 8% in Group OA and 7% in Group RA (p = 0.27). For patients with AKP, the mean AKP Scale was 92.74 (range, 84-98) in Group OA and 93.39 (range, 82-98) in Group RA (p = 0.3)., CONCLUSION: After TKA without resurfacing the patella, patients with RA were determined to have a similar risk for AKP as those with OA., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Therapeutic Study.

The expression of IFN-, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and IL-22 was examined in 54 patients with eRA using a cytometric bead array (CBA). After 72 h of incubation of PBMCs from eRA patients with 1,25(OH)2D3, the levels of IFN-, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-17 significantly decreased compared to those of the control. 1,25(OH)2D3 had no significantly impact on the levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-22. The proportion of Th17 and the ratio of Th17/Treg significantly decreased in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated groups compared to those of the control. 1,25(OH)2D3 had no significantly impact on the proportion of Th1, Th2, Treg, and the ratio of Th1/Th2. Although no statistically significant difference was observed, proportion of Th1 was decreased after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment compared with anti-CD3/CD28 only. The present study demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited the synthesis of specific cytokines: Th1 (IFN-) and Th17 (IL-17, IL-22, IL-6, TNF-alpha) might upregulated Th2 cytokine (IL-4), which indicated the possible immunoregulatory roles and bone-sparing effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in eRA through modulation of the Th1 and Th17 cytokine balance."

Our aim was to assess a possible correlation between SS and the development of osteoporosis. Method(s): The study group consisted of 20 age and sex-matched controls without risk factors for osteoporosis such as menopause, endocrine diseases, glucocorticoid consumption or other inflammatory diseases and 20 patients (17 females, 3 males) with SS. The patients' mean age was 47.7 years (+/-3.1 years) and the mean history of disease prior to study inclusion was 6.3 years (+/-1.2 years). The majority of patients (80%) underwent remissive therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). We measured the BMD of the lumbar spine using a DXA scanner. Result(s): Sicca symptoms were encountered in the majority of patients (90%) and parotidomegaly was discovered in 15 patients (75%). Extraglandular manifestations were represented by arthritis in 11 patients (55%), purpura in 6 patients (30%) and renal tubular acidosis in 4 patients (20%). The BMD, defined by the T-score, was higher in patients with SS with a mean value of -1.54 standard deviations (+/-0.14) compared to -1.81 standard deviations (+/-0.17) in the healthy control group. Conclusion(s): In SS patients the BMD was higher in contrast with the control group due to the use of remissive therapy with HCQ. A study on the effects of HCQ on osteoporosis in patients with SS demonstrated that HCQ decreases bone mineral resorption in vitro [2]."

The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single upadacitinib dose in subjects with normal renal function and in subjects with renal impairment. A total of 24 subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 years were assigned to 1 of 4 renal function groups based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (normal, mild, moderate, severe; N = 6/group). A single 15-mg dose of upadacitinib extended-release formulation was administered under fasting conditions. Serial plasma and urine samples were assayed to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on upadacitinib exposure through regression analysis and analysis of covariance. The primary analysis was the regression analysis of upadacitinib exposures versus estimated glomerular filtration rate. The point estimates for upadacitinib plasma exposure ratios (90% confidence interval [CI]) in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment were 1.18 (90%CI, 1.06-1.32), 1.33 (90%CI, 1.11-1.59), and 1.44 (90%CI, 1.14-1.82) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve and 1.06 (90%CI, 0.92-1.23), 1.11 (90%CI, 0.88-1.40), and 1.14 (90%CI, 0.84-1.56) for maximum observed plasma concentration, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function based on the regression analysis. The analysis of covariance categorical analysis provided consistent results. Upadacitinib was well tolerated by all subjects, and no safety issues were identified in subjects with renal impairment. Renal impairment has a limited effect on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. This is in agreement with the known limited role of urinary excretion in upadacitinib elimination. Based on the limited impact on exposure, no dose adjustment is necessary for upadacitinib in subjects with impaired renal function. Copyright ¬© 2019, The Authors.

Some studies suggest that in RA patients, the prevalence of hypertension increases due to prednisolone use, clinical status, genetic factors, and physical inactivity. On the other hand, dipper and non-dipper status in RA patients compared to non-RA subjects has not been investigated to our knowledge. Purpose of the study is to investigate whether non-dipper status is more deteriorated in RA patients., METHODS: Sixty-five RA patients and 61 age-sex-matched control patients were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. Patients were classified according to 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results. Patients with previous hypertension diagnosis, coronary artery disease, and abnormal kidney function were excluded., RESULTS: Mean age of the study sample was 53.7+/- 12.3 years and 40.5% were male. There was no significant difference between groups in terms of basic demographic characteristics. Leukocyte counts (p= 0.001), neutrophil counts (p= 0.001), and red cell distribution width (p= 0.000) were significantly higher in the RA group. ABPM results indicate no significant difference between RA patients and the control group in terms of daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and average systolic and diastolic blood pressure results (p> 0.05). There was no statistical difference regarding the non-dipper status of patient groups (p= 0.412). Nocturnal blood pressure dipping was significantly similar between groups (p= 0.980)., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, RA patients have similar values in terms of nocturnal blood pressure dipping and hypertension diagnosis as compared to normal population."

Twenty-six subjects (13 men and 13 women) with a mean of 65 years of age, most with malignant disease, were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of paroxetine and placebo. Seventeen subjects had solid tumors, four had hematological malignancies, and five had various nonmalignant or idiopathic conditions, such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or Parkinson's disease. The intensity of pruritus was measured subjectively with a numerical analogue scale. Two subjects dropped out of the study due to side effects of paroxetine, specifically severe nausea and vomiting. The study indicates that for some patients, paroxetine has beneficial effects in the treatment of severe pruritus of nondermatological origin. The investigators speculate that paroxetine's antipruritic activity may be due to modification of central opioid receptors involved in processing of itch signals.

Bioelectronic devices targeting the inflammatory reflex reduce TNF production and inflammation in preclinical models of inflammatory disease, and in patients with RA and Crohn's disease. Here, we assessed the effect of applying a vibrotactile device to the cymba concha of the external ear on inflammatory responses in healthy subjects, as well as its effect on disease activity in RA patients. We first conducted a prospective pilot study of six healthy subjects, and observed that vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha reduced TNF levels compared to pretreatment baseline levels, and the suppressive effect persisted up to 24 hrs. Following this study, we enrolled nineteen healthy subjects in a randomized cross-over study, delivered vibrotactile treatment at either the cymba concha or gastrocnemius, and performed ex vivo whole blood assays. Vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha significantly reduced TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 levels compared to pre-treatment baseline (TNF p < 0.05, IL-6 p < 0.01, IL-1beta p < 0.001), whereas treatment at the gastrocnemius did not attenuate inflammatory responses. Vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha inhibited TNF by 80% (mean +/- SEM: pre-treatment = 4541 +/- 624 pg/ml vs post-treatment = 3625 +/- 645 pg/ ml), IL-6 by 73% (mean +/- SEM: pre-treatment = 5979 +/- 480 pg/ml vs post-treatment = 4342 +/- 597 pg/ml), and IL-1beta by 50% (mean +/- SEM: pre-treatment = 1527 +/- 1429 pg/ml vs post-treatment = 765 +/- 968 pg/ ml) as compared to pre-treatment baseline levels. To assess the effect of vibrotactile treatment on disease activity in RA, nine patients with RA were enrolled in a prospective interventional study. Vibrotactile treatment at the cymba concha significantly decreased DAS28-CRP scores two days post-treatment (DAS28-CRP score mean +/- SEM: pretreatment = 4.19 +/- 0.33 [3.16 - 5.96] vs post-treatment = 3.12 +/- 0.25 [2.43 - 4.37], p < 0.05). Disease activity remained significantly reduced 7 days following vibrotactile treatment (DAS28-CRP score mean +/- SEM: 7 days post-treatment = 2.79 +/- 0.21 [2.14 - 3.96]; p < 0.01). Taken together, these data demonstrate that application of a vibrotactile device to the cymba concha inhibits peripheral blood production of TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in healthy subjects, and attenuates systemic inflammatory responses in RA patients."

Here we tested whether protease inhibition and cystatin C (Cys C) levels are reduced in SS tears, which could lead to enhanced CTSS-driven degradation of tear proteins. CTSS activity against Cys C, LF and sIgA was tested in SS or healthy control tears. Tears from 156 female subjects (33, SS; 33, rheumatoid arthritis; 31, other autoimmune diseases; 35, non-autoimmune dry eye (DE); 24, healthy controls) were analyzed for CTSS activity and Cys C, LF, and sIgA levels. Cys C and LF showed enhanced degradation in SS tears supplemented with recombinant CTSS, but not supplemented healthy control tears. CTSS activity was significantly increased, while Cys C, LF and sIgA levels were significantly decreased, in SS tears compared to other groups. While tear CTSS activity remained the strongest discriminator of SS in autoimmune populations, combining LF and CTSS improved discrimination of SS beyond CTSS in DE patients. Reductions in Cys C and other endogenous proteases may enhance CTSS activity in SS tears. Tear CTSS activity is reconfirmed as a putative biomarker of SS in an independent patient cohort while combined LF and CTSS measurements may distinguish SS from DE patients."

Therapeutic patient education (TPE) is now recognized as a crucial tool in managing conditions like chronic inflammatory rheumatism and in improving treatment adherence. This study aimed to assess whether different TPE programs might improve adherence to subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondyloarthritis (AS), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA)., Methods: This was a retrospective, observational, monocentric study of current care practices. We included 193 patients (124 women; mean age 53.3 +/- 14.8 years). All patients received subcutaneous anti-TNF treatment and one of three TPE models, delivered by a nurse, from 2009 to 2013. The cohort was grouped according to different educational models: M1: information (N=92); M2: individual TPE (N=80); and M3: individual and group TPE sessions (N=21). Adherence was assessed with the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4 TM). Scores were rated as follows: good adherence (MMAS-4 = 4), moderate adherence (MMAS-4 = 2-3), and poor adherence (MMAS-4 = 0-1)., Results: The mean disease duration was 10 years [95% CI: 5 to 18]. The cohort comprised 113 patients with RA, 73 with AS, and seven with PsA. Overall, 146 (75.7%) patients displayed good adherence, 34 (17.6%) displayed moderate adherence, and 13 (6.7%) displayed poor adherence. The M3 group displayed less adherence than the M1 and M2 groups. Old age was the only factor correlated with good adherence (p=0.005). The level of knowledge had no significant impact on adherence., Conclusion: This study demonstrated good adherence to anti-TNF treatment in patients that received TPE, particularly when it was delivered in individual sessions.

The main outcome was pain intensity. Other measurements included disease activity scores (the Disease Activity Score 28-joints; the Simplified Disease Activity Index, SDAI; the Clinical Disease Activity Index, CDAI), functional disability and self-reported quality of life, and the proportion of patients with residual pain (Patient Acceptable Symptom State, PASS)., RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were analyzed, including 39 with RA and OA and 42 with RA only. The patients were mainly women (94%), with a median disease duration of 13 years. This group also reported a higher intensity of pain (visual analogue scale, VAS 70 mm vs. 30 mm; p = 0.003), higher disease activity (3.89 vs. 2.88; p = 0.001), and greater functional disability irrespective of treatment and comorbidities. A strong correlation (r2 = 0.69; p < 0.001) between pain and disease activity was observed, although no differences in pain were observed between groups according to disease activity categories. Patients with RA and OA had a higher proportion of residual pain (59% vs. 29%; p = 0.006) even in the absence of clinical inflammation., CONCLUSION: The coexistence of RA and hand OA is associated with distorted disease activity measurements in RA.

Previous preclinical and clinical studies support the safety and efficacy of UC-II in modulating joint discomfort in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of UC-II in moderating joint function and joint pain due to strenuous exercise in healthy subjects., METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in healthy subjects who had no prior history of arthritic disease or joint pain at rest but experienced joint discomfort with physical activity. Fifty-five subjects who reported knee pain after participating in a standardized stepmill performance test were randomized to receive placebo (n=28) or the UC-II (40 mg daily, n=27) product for 120 days. Joint function was assessed by changes in degree of knee flexion and knee extension as well as measuring the time to experiencing and recovering from joint pain following strenuous stepmill exertion., RESULTS: After 120 days of supplementation, subjects in the UC-II group exhibited a statistically significant improvement in average knee extension compared to placebo (81.0+/-1.3 vs 74.0+/-2.2; p=0.011) and to baseline (81.0+/-1.3 vs 73.2+/-1.9; p=0.002). The UC-II cohort also demonstrated a statistically significant change in average knee extension at day 90 (78.8+/-1.9 vs 73.2+/-1.9; p=0.045) versus baseline. No significant change in knee extension was observed in the placebo group at any time. It was also noted that the UC-II group exercised longer before experiencing any initial joint discomfort at day 120 (2.8+/-0.5 min, p=0.019), compared to baseline (1.4+/-0.2 min). By contrast, no significant changes were seen in the placebo group. No product related adverse events were observed during the study. At study conclusion, five individuals in the UC-II cohort reported no pain during or after the stepmill protocol (p=0.031, within visit) as compared to one subject in the placebo group., CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation with 40 mg of UC-II was well tolerated and led to improved knee joint extension in healthy subjects. UC-II also demonstrated the potential to lengthen the period of pain free strenuous exertion and alleviate the joint pain that occasionally arises from such activities."

Method(s): This is an interim analysis of RA registry, conducted at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung. In the registry, consecutive RA patients who visited Rheumatology clinic at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung (CGMHK) since 01-Sep-2014 and fulfilled classification criteria for RA were enrolled. The demographic data and clinical characteristics, including life style, including diet, evidence of previous fragility fracture, and risk factors of fracture in FRAX were collected. Anti-CCP, rheumatoid factor (RF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), disease activity-28 joint-erythrocyte sedimentation rate score (DAS-28-ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), 25(OH) Vit D, iPTH, and BMD was measured at enrollment. Those participants who were not on low dose glucocorticoid (2.5-7.5 mg/ d prednisolone or equivalent dose) were included as control group and study group comprised of 1:4 randomly selected age-and sex-matched on chronic LDG RA patients. Result(s): A total of 425 participants were enrolled. There were 85 (20%) and 340 (80%) in the control and study group, respectively. The demographics and clinical characteristics revealed comparable between the groups. Compared to control group patients, patients on LDG had significant lower vertebral BMD (L 1-4) (g/cm2), (0.854(0.200) vs. 0.896 (0.201), p=0.046), higher rate of previous fracture (103 (30.3) vs. 13 (15.3), p=0.006), substantially higher 10-year probability of major (14 (15.5) vs. 8 (8.6), p<0.0001) and hip (4.4 (8.4) vs. 2 (3.9), p<0.0001) fracture, respectively. Conclusion(s): It seems RApatients on LDG had similar impact on disease activity (ESR, CRP, and DAS-28 (ESR), as non-LDG users. While, RA on chronic LDG had lower BMD at spine (L1-4), higher rate of previous fracture that predicts substantial higher 10-year probability of fracture than non-LDG users."

To date, no economic evaluations have assessed the cost-effectiveness of baricitinib in the Spanish setting. Objectives: to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of baricitinib versus adalimumab for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active RA in the Spanish setting. Methods: a discrete event simulation model was developed in Microsoft Excel. Costs and outcomes were estimated over a lifetime horizon using the Spanish national payer perspective. The model compared baricitinib 4 mg once daily in combination with methotrexate with adalimumab 40mg every otherweek in combinationwithmethotrexate.Effectiveness and physical function were captured using the American College of Rheumatology criteria and the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, input values of which were derived from a phase 3, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial (RA-BEAM; funded by Eli Lilly and Incyte; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01710358). Costs are presented in Euros, 2018 values. Results: in the base case analysis, baricitinib was associated with a quality-adjusted life year gain of 0.09 years over a lifetime horizon, at an incremental cost of -√¢‚Äö¬¨558 versus adalimumab. Results of various scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis generally were consistent with the base case analysis. Conclusion: this analysis suggests that baricitinib is a cost-effective treatment option compared to adalimumab for Spanish patients with moderately-to-severely active RA and a previous inadequate response or intolerance to csDMARD therapy"
9737819,,10.7717/peerj.17195/table-1,"This study is a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of low-intensity training with blood flow restriction (LIT+BFR) vs high-intensity training (HIT) vs a control group in people with RA, myositis, and osteoarthritis. Participants of each population will be randomized into LIT+BFR, HIT, or control. All functional testing and interventional procedures will be performed at the School of Allied Health Professions (SAHP). The evaluator will be blinded to group allocation. Blood draws and analysis will be performed during visits with the participant's rheumatologist at the Ambulatory Care Center, as part of the standard of care for their visits with their rheumatologist.
 All participants will perform informed consent, which will take place at the SAHP Faculty Clinic. Once a participant has consented, he/she will participate in two familiarization sessions at least 48 hours apart. Familiarization sessions are designed to introduce patients to the exercise equipment, and will consist of the tests used in the evaluation portion of the intervention. Familiarization sessions also aide in better obtaining a patient's 1 repetition max (1RM, i.e. the maximum amount a person can lift one time) by decreasing the learning effect. It has a similar effect with the other functional or objective measures such as grip strength and pain-pressure threshold to decrease learning effect.
 Once 1RM is determined (see 1RM test below), participants will be ranked in tertiles according to their 1RM in the leg press exercise and will then be randomly assigned to LIT+BFR, HIT, or control group. Randomization will be performed by Excel random generator. All participants will then undergo pre-testing that will include subjective questionnaires, and functional testing. Lab work will be performed by the rheumatologists as part of a participant's routine exam during the screening visit.
 Investigators responsible for blood work and lab values will be blinded to participant allocation. A licensed and trained physical therapist, blinded to participant allocation, will be responsible for performing the functional tests. Testing will take a place on a separate day from the interventions. Due to the exercise-based intervention, participants will not be blinded to group allocation.
 Prior to functional testing, each participant's blood pressure and heart rate will be measured to ensure safety with testing.
 1RM test: participants will warm-up for 5 minutes on a stationary cycle. They will perform two light warm-up sets separated by a 2 minute rest. In the first set, participants will perform 8 repetitions of an estimated 50% 1RM. The second set of 8 will be adjusted to 70% 1RM. Participants will then have up to 5 attempts to achieve 1RM load with a 3 minute rest interval between attempts. 1RM test will be conducted on the leg press machine and knee extension machine.
 The below outcome measures will be performed on all patient populations: pain: will be quantified at pre-testing and prior to each exercise session using the numeric pain rating scale. The participant will be asked to rank his/her current pain level and pain intensity in the last 24 hours.
 Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT): the minimum force necessary to induce pain. PPT will be measured using a pressure algometer prior to exercise and post exercise 1 time per week at the proximal forearm and at the proximal tibialis anterior.
 Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE): scale used to measure an individual's perceived intensity of the exercise. This will be measured after each exercise session.
 Walking ability, including balance, gait speed, endurance, and fall risk will be assessed using the Timed Up and Go (TUG), 10 meter walk, and 6 minute walk test (6MWT).
 Grip strength: will be measured using a handheld dynamometer. Three trials per hand will be performed and averaged with 1 minute of rest between trials.
 Bicep strength: will be measured using a handheld dynamometer. Three trials per arm will be performed and averaged with 1 minute rest between trials.
 Short-Form 36 (SF-36): a generic outcome survey to quantify health status and health-related quality of life. A higher score indicates better health condition with 100 being the maximum score.
 Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ): is a patient reported outcome questionnaire and is used to measure disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 The below will only be given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis: clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI): is a composite score of 4 parameters: tender and swollen joints, and a patient's and physician's global score of disease activity. This will be completed by the rheumatologist before and after the study.
 The below will only be given to patients with osteoarthritis: knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS): a general assessment questionnaire regarding patient's opinion on their knee pain and associated problems. To be used for participants with knee OA.
 Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS): a general assessment questionnaire regarding patient's opinion on their hip pain and associated problems. To be used for participants with hip OA.
 Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (FAOS): a general assessment questionnaire regarding patient's opinion on their foot or ankle pain and associated problems. To be used for participants with foot or ankle OA.
 Once a participant in the LIT+BFR or HIT has completed pre-testing and familiarization, he/she will return within one week to begin the exercise protocol. Participants in the control group will be advised to continue with their regular daily activity and will not return until reassessment testing at week 4 and then end of the study at week 8. Participants in LIT+BFR and HIT will come to the SAHP Faculty Clinic to perform their designated exercise program two times per week for 8 weeks. Prior to each exercise session, a participant's blood pressure and heart rate will be documented to ensure safety with proceeding with exercise. Heart rate and blood pressure will be logged and kept in a binder. Each participant's exercise program will be led by a trained research assistant or licensed physical therapist. A licensed physical therapist trained in blood flow restriction training and operation of the Delfi tourniquet system will be onsite for any questions or concerns that may arise during a participant's exercise program. Each participant will perform a standard set of exercises which is outlined below. Each participant will have the BFR cuff placed at the proximal thigh on the affected limb; only those in the LIT+BFR arm of the study will have the cuff inflated: -  Warm up: recumbent bike or stepper with or without blood flow restriction depending on      allocation for 10 minutes.
   -  Knee extension machine (bilateral)
   -  Leg press (bilateral)
 During the first week of training, participants will be introduced to the training load. Participants in the LIT+BFR will perform 20% of their 1RM and participants in HIT will perform 50% of 1RM. During the 2nd week of training intensity will be adjusted to 30% 1RM and 70% 1RM for LIT+BFR and HIT respectively. LIT+BFR will perform 1 set of 30 repetitions upon initiating weighted exercise (i.e. knee extension machine and leg press machine). After the completion of 30 repetitions of the respective exercise, he/she will perform an additional 3 sets of 15 repetitions. The HIT group will perform 4 sets of 10 repetitions of each respective exercise. A one minute rest will be allowed between all sets for each group
 1RM will be reassessed at 4 weeks and training loads will be adjusted accordingly.
 Blood flow restriction for participants in the LIT+BFR will be determined by the Delfi system. A full description of the Delfi system can be found in section 9.4. Briefly, a specialized blood pressure cuff will be applied to the proximal thigh prior to the start of each session. The Delfi system will measure the participant's full occlusion pressure and will then be adjusted to 80% of full occlusion to begin the exercise protocol. The occlusion pressure will be maintained throughout the exercise and will be relieved (reperfusion phase) after the completion of all sets of each individual exercise. The participant will be allowed to rest for up to 3 minutes between exercises. If a participant verbalizes discomfort, the occlusion pressure will be decreased and/or the repetitions or sets will be decreased. Participants will be allowed to stop the exercise protocol at any time should they experience significant discomfort.
 A participant will be considered to have completed the study after participating in 8 weeks of exercise training with at least 12 of 16 intervention visits. At the end of the training protocol, the participant will again come to the SAHP Faculty Clinic within one week of study completion for post-testing. He/she will complete the questionnaires and functional testing as noted for pre-testing. He/she will go to the Rheumatology Clinic to complete routine blood work/lab values. Participants in the control group will come back for post testing after 8 weeks of continuing usual daily activity."

METHODS: from June 2015 to June 2016, 40 RA patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly divided into two groups. There were 20 patients in PCIA group, including 3 males and 17 females, with an average age of(59.6¬±2.3) years old, who received controlled instillation of sufentanil analgesia controlled by an intravenous analgesia pump. There were 20 patients in multiple model analgesia group, including 2 males and 18 females, with an average age of(56.3¬±1.3) years old, who were treated with continuous femoral nerve block, local injection of knee joint and combined buprenorphine patches. The VAS score and the incidence of adverse reactions and HSS score were compared between the two groups after operation. The advantages and disadvantages of the two modes of analgesia were evaluated.
RESULTS: on the 6 th and 24 th hours after surgery, the VAS scores of the multimodal analgesia group were significantly lower than those of the PCIA group(
CONCLUSIONS: multimodal analgesia is an ideal analgesic plan for total knee arthroplasty TKA patients with RA in perioperative period, which has good effects and little adverse reaction."

One hundred sixty-one patients completed at least 20 weeks of therapy. Response to a variety of measures of efficacy was generally modest for both gold treatment groups although improvement was continuing in both groups at the end of the study. There was statistically significant improvement with both gold preparations compared to placebo for the number of tender joints, the joint tenderness score, and physician assessment of disease severity. GST was also significantly better than placebo for the joint swelling score. GST demonstrated more improvement in patients with anemia and thrombocytosis compared to the other treatment groups and both gold preparations were superior to placebo in improvement of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Twenty-seven percent of patients on GST were withdrawn from the study for adverse drug reaction with rash and stomatitis being the predominant cause. Only 6% of patients on AUR were withdrawn for untoward drug effect. The time of onset of the adverse reactions is discussed. The two gold preparations were similar in efficacy although AUR was better tolerated."
9737837,,10.3899/jrheum.101038,"Purpose: Methotrexate (MTX) treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is often associated with side-effects and/or safety concerns. MTX metabolites are thought to play a significant role in MTX toxicity. Therefore, theoretically, a metabolically inert antifolate such as CH-1504, should be safer and better tolerated while providing comparable efficacy. We report results of a phase II clinical trial designed to show ""Proof of Concept"" for this class of compounds. Methods: MTX naive patients (N=201) with moderate to severe RA were enrolled in this 16 week, multi-center, randomized and double-blind study. Patients received either CH-1504 (0.25mg, 0.5mg or 1.0mg once daily oral doses) or MTX (titrated to 20.0mg once weekly). All patients received a once weekly 10mg folate supplement. Observations were made at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks with a treatment free follow-up at 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the ACR20 response at week 12. Secondary endpoints included DAS28 scores and the individual components of the ACR20 composite index as well as the safety and tolerability of treatment. Results: Demographic parameters were similar in the 4 treatment groups with a mean age at enrollment for the entire study population of 54.3 +/- 11.4 years, a majority being female (87%) and a mean DAS28 was 6.6 +/- 0.9. At week 12 all CH-1504 treatment groups showed comparable efficacy to MTX as measured by ACR20 and DAS28 response rates. This was also seen in the key indicator sub components of the composite index including tender and swollen joints. A dose-response relationship over the dose range tested was not observed in the timeframe of this trial. (Table presented) CH-1504 appeared safe and well tolerated at all dose levels. Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild in all arms of the study. The % of patients with serum ALT elevations above 1X upper limit of normal was lower at all doses of CH-1504 compared to MTX. The % of patients with, and dropouts because of, GI related AEs were lower at all doses of CH-1504 compared to MTX. Conclusion: This 16 week proof-of-concept study in MTX-naive RA patients demonstrated that CH-1504 has comparable efficacy to MTX and may be safer and better tolerated. Metabolically inert antifolates are a promising therapeutic option and warrant further study."

Prolonged acceptable disease control was defined as not restarting TNFi treatment within 12 months after stopping. Baseline demographic and disease-related variables were included in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis for identifying predictors of relapse., Results: One year after baseline, 220 patients (50.1%) had not restarted TNFi treatment. Use of an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody (versus a receptor antagonist, OR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.58-3.67), <=10 yrs. disease duration (OR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.42-3.26) and low or moderate multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) scores (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.10-3.64) at baseline were independently predictive of successful TNFi discontinuation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.61-0.71). Results were similar when using no physician-reported flare as the criterion. TNFi-free survival was significantly different for patient groups based on the number of predictors present, ranging from 21.4% of patients with no predictor present to 66.7% of patients with all three predictors present., Conclusion: Patients using an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, with shorter disease duration and low or moderate baseline MBDA score are most likely to achieve prolonged disease control after TNFi discontinuation., Trial registration: Netherlands Trial Register NTR3112, 21 October 2011."

Inflammatory markers, rheumatoid factor (RF), and antibodies mentioned above were assessed in all patients., RESULTS: In the EIA group, we observed significantly higher concentration of a-CEP-1 (65.8 +/- 111.6 RU/mL) than in controls (2.0 +/- 0.0 RU/mL). In RF(+) RA patients, we observed higher concentration of a-Sa and a-CEP-1 than in other groups. A-Sa were positive in 69% of RF(+) RA, 37% of RF(-) RA, 26% of UA patients and in 10% of controls. A-CEP-1 were positive in 77% of RF(+) RA patients, in 56% of RF(-) RA patients, in 8.7% of UA patients, but they were negative in controls. In patients with RF(+) RA, positive a-CarP were present statistically significantly more often than in RF (-) RA patients. No statistically significant difference in frequency of a-hnRNP/RA33 and AFA between RF(+) RA, RF(-) RA, and UA was observed., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a-CEP-1 may help in differentiation between RF(-) RA and UA. a-CEP-1 and a-Sa may be useful while diagnosing EIA. a-CarP may be used in differentiation of RA RF(-) and UA. However, a follow-up study is needed to evaluate the prognostic value of analyzed antibodies."

Only the intervention group was aware of the results of their practice audit including the frequency of measurements they were performing and outcomes of their patients compared to the others in both the intervention and control groups (comparative data of their practice to others). Interventions were monthly web-based conferences on the value of systematic assessments in RA and barriers to care with recent evidence based information, journal club, surveys and improvements on forms used in daily practice to collect data. Results: 1000 serial RA charts were audited at 0 and another at 6 months with no between groups differences in patient characteristics (mean disease of 10 years and 77% women, 74% RF positive and mean DAS 3.7); 68% on current Mtx, 14% on steroids and 27% on biologics. At 6 months, there were significantly different within and between groups changes in how often many variables were measured and changes in treatment. The intervention group collected more patient global assessments (53% pre vs 66% post intervention and MD globals 51% vs 60%; p<0.05) and HAQs collected went from 37% to 42%; whereas control group had no change in outcomes collected. For the intervention group there was a 32% increase in calculable composite scores (such as DAS, CDAI, SDAI) (p<0.05) and no change in the control group. There was more targeting to a low disease state. For those with SDAI between 3.3 and 11, the % receiving a change in Rx (injection, or change in DMARD) was 66% in intervention and 36% in control group (p<0.05); similarly in DAS between 2.4 and 3.6; 57% of intervention and 38% of control group made changes to treatment (p<0.05). Table shows within and between groups differences. (Table presented) Conclusions: Despite a good baseline systematic assessment and many patients in a low disease state, there was improvement in the intervention group that surpassed the control group in both the frequency of performing assessments and the number of treatment changes when patients were not in remission. This is the first RCT of RA rheumatologist education where a result of a change in behavior has been linked directly to an intervention (comparative practice and education) as the control group did not change behavior. Small group learning with feedback from practice audits is an inexpensive way to improve outcomes in RA."

This digitization creates an opportunity for interactive survey elements, potentially improving respondents' understanding and/or engagement., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to understand whether, and how, training materials in a survey influenced stated preferences., METHODS: An online discrete-choice experiment (DCE) was designed to elicit public preferences for a new targeted approach to prescribing biologics (""biologic calculator"") for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with conventional prescribing. The DCE presented three alternatives, two biologic calculators and a conventional approach (opt out), described by five attributes: delay to treatment, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, infection risk, and cost saving to the national health service. Respondents were randomized to receive training materials as plain text or an animated storyline. Training materials contained information about RA and approaches to treatment and described the biologic calculator. Background questions included sociodemographics and self-reported measures of task difficulty and attribute non-attendance. DCE data were analyzed using conditional and heteroskedastic conditional logit (HCL) models., RESULTS: In total, 300 respondents completed the DCE, receiving either plain text (n = 158) or the animated storyline (n = 142). The HCL showed the estimated coefficients for all attributes aligned with a priori expectations and were statistically significant. The scale term was statistically significant, indicating that respondents who received plain-text materials had more random choices. Further tests suggested preference homogeneity after accounting for differences in scale., CONCLUSIONS: Using animated training materials did not change the preferences of respondents, but they appeared to improve choice consistency, potentially allowing researchers to include more complex designs with increased numbers of attributes, levels, alternatives or choice sets."

 The Acute Respiratory Syndrome by Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan/China, is causing a worldwide pandemic with potentially lethal implications on an individual basis, and, on the large scale bringing the health care systems and the economy to its limits. The mortality rate of this COronaVIrus induced Disease, COVID-19, has been estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be 3.7%, which is more than 10-fold higher than the mortality of influenza.
 An infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause an excessive host immune response, leading to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death. Reports from China and from Italy describe an overwhelming inflammation which is triggered by the virus, causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome (CRS) and/or Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19 include elevated levels of ferritin, d-dimer and low platelets.
 There is increasing evidence, that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis. In recognition of the dramatic development of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in a pragmatic manner, already approved and safe therapies should be evaluated for the use in severe COVID-19.
 Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6R biological therapy, has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS (and in other rheumatologic conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), with a good safety profile also in the elderly).
 Collectively, the data strongly suggest that neutralization of the inflammatory pathway induced by IL-6 may reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 prone to CRS and ARDS."

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy and tolerability of leflunomide 20 mg, leflunomide 10 mg, tacrolimus 3 mg, tacrolimus 1.5-2 mg, and placebo, based on the number of withdrawals of RA patients, were included. We performed a Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis to combine direct and indirect evidence from the RCTs. Six RCTs including 1510 patients met the inclusion criteria. The proportion of patient withdrawals owing to lack of efficacy was significantly lower in the leflunomide 20 mg (OR 0.17, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.08-0.34); leflunomide 10 mg (OR 0.16, 95% CrI 0.02-0.75); and tacrolimus 3 mg (OR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.21-0.74) groups than in the placebo group. Rank probability based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values indicated that leflunomide 20 mg had the highest probability of being the best treatment based on the number of withdrawals owing to lack of efficacy (SUCRA = 0.8530), followed by leflunomide 10 mg (SUCRA = 0.8321), tacrolimus 3 mg (SUCRA = 0.4965), tacrolimus 1.5-2 mg (SUCRA = 0.3035), and placebo (SUCRA = 0.0150). Patient withdrawals owing to adverse events did not differ significantly among the groups; however, withdrawals in the placebo group were fewer than those in the leflunomide 20 mg group (OR 0.22, 95% CrI 0.07-0.74). Placebo had the highest probability of being the most tolerable treatment (SUCRA = 0.8161) followed by tacrolimus 3 mg (SUCRA = 0.6490), tacrolimus 1.5-2 mg (SUCRA = 0.4857), leflunomide 10 mg (SUCRA = 0.4651), and leflunomide 20 mg (SUCRA = 0.0841). Leflunomide 20 mg, leflunomide 10 mg, and tacrolimus 3 mg were more efficacious than placebo, while leflunomide 20 mg was less tolerable than placebo. Leflunomide is likely to be more efficacious but less tolerable than tacrolimus for RA treatment."
9737867,,10.4081/reumatismo.2006.22,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the SDAI values to DAS28 scores in RA patients undergoing different DMARD regimens., METHODS: The SDAI is an unweighted numerical sum of five outcome parameters: tender and swollen joint count (based on 28-joint assessment), patient and physician global assessment of disease activity (visual analogue scale: 0-10 cm) and level of C-reactive protein (mg/dl). 80 patients (F/M 68/12; age between 20-68 years, median 52) with active rheumatoid arthritis were prospectively enrolled in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups according to the therapeutic regimens: group I: Methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg/weekly + salazopyrin 2 g/daily; group II: MTX 15 mg/weekly + infliximab 3 mg/Kg at time 0, 2, 4 and every 8 weeks; group III: MTX 15 mg/weekly + etanercept 25 mg/twice weekly; group IV: MTX 15 mg/weekly + adalimumab 40 mg/every other week. SDAI and DAS28 were determined at baseline and after 6 months in each patient. Mean changes in SDAI values were compared to those detected in DAS 28 at baseline and after 6 months., RESULTS: SDAI and DAS 28 were found to be significantly correlated at baseline. Moreover, changes in SDAI over time paralleled those in DAS, and were found to be significantly correlated., CONCLUSIONS: SDAI is a valid measure of response to treatment in RA patients undergoing different therapeutic regimens."

To assess usability and patient perceptions of the sarilumab auto-injector device (""sarilumab pen"") among patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Design. 12-week, randomized, parallel-group usability study. Setting and participants. The study was conducted at 53 centers in 6 countries. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of RA (as defined by American College of Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism 2010 Criteria) of >= 3-month disease duration, willing and able to self inject, continuous treatment with 1 or a combination of nonbiologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (except leflunomide in combination with methotrexate); and moderatly to severely active RA, defined as 4/66 swollen joint, 4/68 tender joints, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) measurement >= 4 mg/L. Exclusion criteria were age Patients were randomized 1: 1: 1: 1 to sarilumamb 150 or 200 mg every 2 weeks administered by single-use, disposable, prefilled pen or pre-filled syringe. Randomization method was not reported. Main outcomes measures. The primary endpoint was number of ""product technical failures"" (PTFs). Patients randomized to the pen were given a diary that had questions related to their ability to remove the cap, start the injection, and complete the injection. Participants were asked to answer the questions each time they used the pen. If the response was ""no"" to any of the 3 questions, this was considered a ""product technical complaint"" (PTC). PTCs that had a validated technical cause based on pen evaluation and analysis were considered PTFs. In addition, patient perceptions and satisfaction with the pen were assessed via questionnaire. At baseline, patients were asked about injections and prior experience with self-injection, and at 12 weeks they were asked about their experiences in using the pen. Other outcomes assessed included adverse events and pharmokinetic parameters. Results. 217 participants were enrolled: 108 patients were in the pen group (56 randomized to 150 mg and 52 randomized to 200 mg) and 109 were in the syringe group (53 randomized to 150 mg and 56 randomized to 200 mg). Completion rates were similar among groups. Sixteen patients discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events. There were no PTFs. There was one PTC, in which the user accidently bumped the pen, which expelled the drug onto the floor. At baseline, before the first injection, the majority of patients reported that they were not afraid of needles (58%), had past experience with self-injections (55%), and were either ""very confident"" or ""extremely confident"" regarding self-injections (55%). After the 12-week assessment phase, when asked about their overall level of satisfaction, 98% of patients reported they were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with the sarilumab pen. Treatment emergent adverse events occurred in 66% of patients, with no clinically meaningful differences leading to discontinuation in the pen and syringe groups. The most common adverse events were infections and neutropenia. Conclusion. Patients successfully completed self-injections with the sarilumab pen and found it easy to use.

We aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of SB5 after switching from ADA in RA, axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients., METHOD: Adult RA, PsA, axSpA, JIA patients treated with ADA for at least 6 months, switched to SB5 in stable clinical conditions, were eligible. Data on safety, activity indexes and patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after switching., RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (19 RA, 28 PsA, 32 axSpA and 3 JIA; 45 females, mean age 54 +/- 14 years, disease duration 13 +/- 7 years, ADA duration 6 +/- 3 years) were enrolled. RA patients showed stable conditions, while PsA patients showed an increase in both HAQ, DAS28(CRP) and DAPSA and axSpA patients an increase in VAS pain, VAS patient disease activity and ASDAS, both at 3 months. There were changes in the concomitant medications profile, with regression of activity indexes increases at 6 months. Adverse events were reported by 33.7% patients at 3 months and 16.6% patients at 6 months, mostly disease flares and infectious events. Two patients stopped SB5., CONCLUSIONS: Despite temporary changes in the concomitant medication profile for mild disease flares, our real-life data replicate the safety profile of switching from ADA to SB5 in RA, with additional data for its applicability in PsA and axSpA patients, further supporting switching to biosimilars in treating inflammatory rheumatic conditions. Key Points* Switching from adalimumab originator to SB5 is feasible in real life rheumatic inflammatory joint diseases.* Mild disease flares can present after switching from originator adalimumab to SB5, in particular in axial spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis.* Changes in concomitant medications profile allows the control of minor disease flares presenting after switching from adalimumab originator to SB5."

Data Sources: Articles were identified using a PubMed search from inception through January 2019 using the terms rheumatoid arthritis, Olumiant, baricitinib, and LY3009104, its molecular name. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Articles relating to randomized clinical trials, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of baricitinib were evaluated. Data Synthesis: Baricitinib exerts its effects by inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2 enzymes, targeting cytokine and growth factor receptor stimulation, thus reducing downstream immune cell function. Four trials have demonstrated the efficacy of baricitinib with or without methotrexate in patients naive to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and those who had an inadequate response to or intolerance to both conventional and biological DMARDs. Furthermore, baricitinib was associated with delayed radiographic progression. Despite baricitinib 4 mg often demonstrating greater efficacy compared with the 2 mg dose, only the 2 mg dose is Food and Drug Administration approved because of safety concerns with the 4 mg dose, primarily thromboembolism. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Baricitinib provides an oral treatment option for patients failing tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis). Safety, cost, and comparative effectiveness to tofacitinib should be considered prior to prescribing baricitinib. Conclusion:  Baricitinib is the second medication in its class and has been proven efficacious for the treatment of RA. Given concerns for adverse effects associated with baricitinib, it should be reserved for patients who have failed one or more TNFis."

9737907,,10.3389/fphar.2018.01051,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by chronic destructive synovitis and is associated with progressive disability, systemic difficulties, premature death, and socioeconomic costs. Early intervention with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate (MTX) and its combination regimen would provide obvious benefits to patients, healthcare systems and society. MTX and tripterygium glycosides tablets (TGTS) are most frequently prescribed medicines for RA, and the combination of them occurs frequently in anti-RA prescriptions. While the underlying combination mechanisms and the affected variation of drug blood level remain unclear. According to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for improvement, clinical evaluation following three treatment groups (i.e., MTX and TGTS mono- and combined groups) were carried out at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks in a randomized controlled clinical trial. To monitor the affected variation of drug blood level and perturbation of metabolites caused by MTX plus TGTS combined to treat active RA, the collected plasma samples were analyzed using RRLC-QqQ-MS and UHPLC-QE Orbitrap HRMS instruments. As a result, 39 metabolites including 7 MTX-related metabolites, 13 TGTS-related migratory ingredients and 19 characteristic endogenous metabolites, were quantitatively determined in plasma samples of RA patients after oral administration. The potential mechanism of MTX and TGTS combination were preliminarily elucidated on the aspect of clinical biochemical test indicators integrated with quantitative plasma pharmacochemistry and the pseudotargeted metabolomics.

We enrolled 81 patients, 45 diagnosed with SS (39 with primary SS, 6 with secondary SS) and 36 diagnosed with other CTDs. All patients underwent a prospective evaluation of sicca symptoms, a Schirmer's test, and a B-mode US assessment of the parotid and submandibular glands, all blinded to the diagnosis. Each SG was semi-quantitatively scored 0-3; a grade >= 2 was considered pathological. SGUS involvement was classified as normal or pathological at the patient level and for each pair at the gland level. In addition, a total SGUS score of 0-12 and a parotid/submandibular score of 0-6 were calculated for each patient. Autoimmunity laboratory data were also obtained. All SGUS scores were higher in SS patients than in those with CTD (p < 0.001) and significantly more SS patients showed a pathological global (p < 0.001), parotid (p < 0.001), or submandibular (p = 0.001) US score compared with CTD patients. In SS patients, the presence of autoantibodies was significantly associated with pathological SGUS and higher scores, particularly at the parotid level, while in CTD patients, xerostomia and a pathological Schirmer's test were associated with pathological US and higher scores at the submandibular level (p < 0.05). SGUS showed a different grade of abnormality, site involvement, and associated autoantibody profile in SS patients as compared with other CTD. KEY POINTS: * Patients with SS and other CTDs showed different grades of SGUS abnormality. * Patients with SS and other CTDs showed different gland involvement and associated autoantibody profiles. * Anti-Ro60 and anti-Ro52 Ro60 positivity were associated with the severity of parotid involvement in SS patients."
9737910,,10.3899/jrheum.180178,"OBJECTIVE: Biologic therapies can improve disease control for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but may be both overused and underused. We aimed to identify predictors of greater use of biologic therapies and to identify factors associated with persistent glucocorticoid use., METHODS: Using national US Veteran's Affairs databases 2005-2016, we identified patients with RA receiving a first-ever prescription of methotrexate (MTX), requiring >= 6 months of baseline data. We evaluated predictors of biologic therapy initiation within 2 years of starting MTX and factors associated with baseline and persistent glucocorticoid use at 6-12 months using multivariable models., RESULTS: Among 17,415 patients starting MTX, 3263 patients received biologic therapy within 2 years (20.6% 2-yr incidence). In adjusted analyses, biologic use was substantially lower in older patients [e.g., aHR 0.20 (95% CI 0.16, 0.26) for patients >= 80 vs < 50] and patients with more comorbidities [aHR 0.79 (95% CI 0.72, 0.87) for Charlson score >= 3 vs < 3]. Patients with heart failure [aHR 0.68 (95% CI 0.54, 0.84)], cancer [aHR 0.78 (95% CI 0.66, 0.92)], or who were nonwhite [aHR 0.79 (95% CI 0.72, 0.87)] were also less likely to receive a biologic. In contrast, baseline and persistent glucocorticoid use was similar across age groups and more common in patients with greater comorbidity., CONCLUSION: Biologic therapy is initiated less frequently in patients with RA who are older, have more comorbidities, and who are nonwhite. While biologics may be avoided in older and sicker patients because of safety concerns, glucocorticoid use is similar regardless of age and is more frequent in patients with comorbidities, with implications for patient outcomes."

Paeoniflorin (PA) has achieved positive results to some extent for the treatment of RA., Purpose: This study aimed to reveal the potential druggable targets of PA in an experimental RA model using quantitative proteomics analysis., Study design and methods: Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a normal group, model group and PA group. PA (1 mg/kg) was used to treat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats for 42 days. We used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based quantitative proteomics to analyze the synovial tissue of rats. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software was applied to process the data. The proteins that were targeted via IPA software were verified by Western blots., Results: We found that PA caused 86 differentially expressed proteins (>=1.2-fold or <=0.84-fold) compared with the CIA group. Of these varied proteins, 20 significantly changed (p<0.05) proteins referred to 41 CIA-relative top pathways after IPA pathway analysis. Thirteen of the PA-regulated pathways were anchored, which intervened in 24 biological functions. Next, network analysis revealed that leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and asporin (ASPN), which participate in two significant networks, contributed the most to the efficacy of PA treatment. Additionally, Western blots confirmed the aforementioned druggable targets of PA for the treatment of RA., Conclusion: The results reveal that PA may treat RA by decreasing two key proteins, LIFR and ASPN. Our research helps to identify potential agents for RA treatment."

A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to combine the direct and indirect evidence from the RCTs., RESULTS: Four RCTs, involving 2667 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR)50 response rate was significantly higher in the sarilumab 200 mg and sarilumab 200 mg + methotrexate (MTX) groups than in the placebo + MTX group (odds ratio, OR, of 4.05, 95% credible interval, CrI, of 2.04-8.33 and OR of 3.75, 95% CrI of 2.37-5.72, respectively). Compared to the placebo + MTX group, the sarilumab 150 mg + MTX and adalimumab 40 mg groups showed a significantly higher ACR50 response rate. The ranking probability based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated that sarilumab 200 mg was likely to achieve the best ACR50 response rate (SUCRA = 0.8518), followed by sarilumab 200 mg + MTX (SUCRA = 0.8225), sarilumab 150 mg + MTX (SUCRA = 0.5112), adalimumab 40 mg (SUCRA = 0.3072), and placebo + MTX (SUCRA = 0.0072). The ACR50 and ACR70 response rate distributions were comparable, except that sarilumab 200 mg + MTX was likely to achieve the best ACR70 response rate. The tolerability based on the number of patient withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) did not differ significantly between the treatments, except that placebo + MTX was likely to be the best tolerated., CONCLUSION: Sarilumab 150 and 200 mg are efficacious treatments for active RA and are well tolerated."

In the current study we have investigated possible mechanisms of this effect by comparing sulfasalazine with other structurally related aminosalicylate (5- ASA) drugs (mesalazine, olsalazine and balsalazide) for associations with changes in HbA1c and other hematological parameters. Material(s) and Method(s): An observational cohort study was performed using comprehensive electronic medical records from individuals in the Scottish Care Information Diabetes Collaboration (SCI-Diabetes) in Tayside and Fife, Scotland. Individuals with type 2 diabetes and an incident prescription for a 5-ASA drug between 1st January 2006 and 30th April 2017 were eligible for the study. To allow assessment of HbA1c change, individuals were required to have a baseline HbA1c (defined as closest measure between 6 months prior and 7 days after drug start date) and a treatment HbA1c (defined as the measure closest to 6 months after drug start but within a 3 to 9 months window). To investigate the hemolytic association, change in the constituents of the full blood count were also assessed between baseline and 6 months, where measures were available. As sulfasalazine is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and mesalazine, olsalazine and balsalazide are used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, we compared patient characteristics at baseline between the drug groups. Variables of interest included gender, age, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, diabetes therapy and constituents of the full blood count. Comparison of baseline characteristics by drug group was by t-test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Paired t-tests were used to compare the difference in baseline and treatment measures. Result(s): A total of 216 individuals were eligible for the study. This was split by 113 individuals on sulfasalazine, 103 on mesalazine with no eligible individuals on olsalazine or balsalazide. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the sulfasalazine and mesalazine groups at baseline. We observed a mean(SD) HbA1c reduction of -0.85(1.4)% (p < 0.0001) in the sulfasalazine group. There was no significant association in the mesalazine group (0.17(1.4)% (p = 0.23)). Sulfasalazine was associated with a mean(SD) increase in mean cell corpuscular volume of 3.7(5.9)fL (p < 0.0001) and a decrease in red blood cells of -0.23(0.4) x 10-12/L (p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In this large, observational, population-based study we show that sulfasalazine was associated with a significant decrease in HbA1c of 0.85% within a 6 month period. In contrast, mesalazine use was associated with a nonsignificant increase in HbA1c. Our results are consistent with hemolytic effects of sulfasalazine contributing to HbA1c-lowering. These may be contributed by the sulfapyridine pharmacophore in sulfasalazine, which is absent in mesalazine. We do not exclude, owing to the observational nature of our study, that the difference in effect of these two drugs on HbA1c may also be related to differences in absorption or prescribing patterns. This study provides numerous future research opportunities that could guide future clinical practice in diabetes."

Although several studies have reported the objective outcome of TKA in RA and OA patients, few studies have compared post-operative patient-satisfaction levels., Methods: In this clinical cohort study 171 patients (RA: n=33, OA: n=138) who underwent TKA with posterior stabilizing knee prosthesis were included. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Oxford Knee Score (OKS) were used to evaluate and compare patients' satisfaction 6 and 12 months after TKA relative to their preoperative state and to make an assessment between two groups., Results: Both of patient-reported scoring systems showed a statistically significant improvement for OA and RA patients at 6 and 12 months after surgery, relative to their preoperative scores. The results of the OKS and KOOS did not show statistically significant improvement from 6 to 12 months n RA patients. Unlike RA group, OKS and KOOS revealed further improvement between 6 and 12 months for the osteoarthritic patients., Conclusion: OA patients had continuous improvement in their satisfaction in the first year after TKA with a gentle upward curve. In contrast, in RA patients, recovery was faster and greater in the first six months after surgery and slowed down in the second six months. Patient-reported outcome scores were not significantly different between two groups at the end of the first year."

Aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of non-specific rheumatic manifestations (RMs) in HT subjects without classified autoimmune comorbidities., METHODS: 500 HT patients (467 F, 33 M; median age 41 years, range 14-69) and 310 age- and sex-matched controls, consecutively referred to the Endocrine Unit of Messina University Hospital, were evaluated for non-specific RMs. None took L-thyroxine., EXCLUSION CRITERIA: autoimmune comorbidities, infectious, and/or inflammatory diseases, history of neoplasia, BMI > 30 kg/m2., RESULTS: In our HT cohort, 100 patients (20%) complained of one or more RMs, vs 21 controls (6.8%; P < 0.001). There were minimal differences between the manifestations recorded in the two groups, the most common being polyarthralgias and myalgias/fibromyalgia, but non-specific RMs occurred threefold more in HT patients. Comparing HT patients with RMs (96 F and 4 M) with those affected by HT alone, female sex was prevalent (F:M ratio 24:1 vs 5:1) with higher age at diagnosis (median 43 vs 37 years; P < 0.001). HT patients with RMs (62%) were mostly euthyroid (median TSH 2.0 micro IU/L) and only 7% overtly hypothyroid, discouraging a possible causal relationship between thyroid dysfunction per se and RMs., CONCLUSIONS: A significant percentage of HT patients complains of non-specific rheumatic signs and symptoms, in the absence of other diagnosed systemic comorbidities and regardless of thyroid functional status, deserving careful evaluation and prolonged follow-up."

However, physical activity can be challenging for persons who are fatigued. The aim of this study was to investigate factors of importance for reducing fatigue in persons with RA., DESIGN: This is a qualitative interview study based on semistructured, indepth individual interviews. Interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis., PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 12 people with RA recruited from a previous randomised controlled trial of a person-centred treatment model focusing on health-enhancing physical activity and daily balance to lessen fatigue in persons with RA., SETTING: Interviews were conducted in a hospital setting., RESULTS: The analysis resulted in one theme: an intellectual and embodied understanding that sustainable physical activity is important to handle fatigue. This included five categories describing barriers and facilitating factors for sustainable physical activity: mentally overcoming the fatigue in order to be active, making exercise easy, reaching for balance, receiving support to be physically active and dealing with RA disease to be physically active., CONCLUSION: The participants in this study expressed that physical activity was important in handling fatigue, but also that this insight could only come from personal experience. The use of a person-centred ethic in physiotherapy coaching for patients with fatigue appears to promote sustainable physical activity behaviours by facilitating patients' resources to overcome barriers to physical activity.

Female SLE and RA patients, aged from 16 to 49, were randomly selected from the Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology division of an outpatient clinic at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. These patients were interviewed and underwent a physical examination. The structured instruments used in the study were a Rheumatology Living Impact Questionnaire, Symptoms Checklist -90-Revised (SCL-90-R), Rheumatology Attitudes Index (RAI), Modified SLE Activity Measure (M-SLAM), and RA Symptoms Measure. The study included 103 SLE and 50 RA female patients. Patients suffered multi-dimensional life impact, which included physical function, psychiatric symptoms, leisure/social/activities, household chores, family function, and job impact. SLE patients experienced less physical function difficulty (t = -3.17, p < 0.01) and helplessness (t = -2.03, p < 0.05). But there was no difference in terms of psychiatric status, leisure/social/activities, household chores, job adjustment and family function.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are considered important in RA; however, some symptoms such as morning joint stiffness (MJS) and fatigue that are considered important by patients are not captured by the American College of Rheumatology ""core set"" measures for RA trials. The US Food and Drug Administration has endorsed electronic capture of clinical trial data including PROs, and electronic PRO (ePRO) systems may lead to more accurate and complete data capture, improved compliance, and patient acceptance compared with paper-based methods. Our objective was to assess the implementation of ePRO measures of Duration and Severity of MJS, Severity of Worst Tiredness, and Severity of Worst Joint Pain in baricitinib RA-BEAM and RA-BUILD phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs)., METHODS: A daily electronic diary (handheld device; Invivodata R, Inc.) was utilized to capture PRO data in the RCTs. Three ""reporting window"" options were incorporated to accommodate differences in patients' routine daily schedules, and alarms were programmed for each reporting window. Duration of MJS was recorded in ""hours and minutes,"" and Severity of MJS, Worst Tiredness, and Worst Joint Pain were captured on a 0 to 10 rating scale, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms. The patients and site staff were trained to use the daily electronic diary., RESULTS: Patients with moderately to severely active RA used the daily electronic diary in the RA-BEAM study (N = 1305) and RA-BUILD study (N = 684). The average compliance, calculated as total days completed by patients compared with total days expected to complete the diary, through Week 12 was high (RA-BEAM 94% patients; RA-BUILD 93% patients), potentially attributable to appropriate training, clarity of instructions, simple user interface, and electronic device design. Identified process challenges included non-timely issuance of the device, low battery, inadequate training of patients before data collection, inappropriate diary set-up, and first response entry 1 day after the baseline visit., CONCLUSIONS: High compliance rates support the use of the daily electronic PRO diary in large RCTs. Despite the anticipated issues, the daily electronic diary is expected to reduce recall bias and improve the quality of PRO data collection., TRIAL REGISTRATION: RA-BEAM ( NCT01710358 ) and RA-BUILD ( NCT01721057 )."

Few real-world studies have evaluated the impact of comorbidity burden or obesity on the effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ). This study evaluated TCZ effectiveness in treating RA patients with high versus low comorbidity burden and obesity versus non-obesity in US clinical practice., METHODS: Patients in the Corrona RA registry who initiated TCZ were stratified by low or high comorbidity burden using a modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (mCCI) and by obese or nonobese status using body mass index (BMI). Improvements in disease activity and functionality after TCZ initiation were compared for the aforementioned strata of patients at 6 and 12 months after adjusting for statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics., RESULTS: We identified patients with high (mCCI >= 2; n = 195) and low (mCCI < 2; n = 575) comorbidity burden and patients categorized as obese (BMI >= 30; n = 356) and nonobese (BMI < 30; n = 449) who were treated with TCZ. Most patients (> 95%) were biologic experienced and approximately one-third of patients received TCZ as monotherapy, with no significant differences between patients by comorbidity burden or obesity status. Improvement in disease activity and functionality at 6 and 12 months was similar between groups, regardless of comorbidity burden or obesity status., CONCLUSION: In this real-world analysis, TCZ was frequently used to treat patients with high comorbidity burden or obesity.

Knowledge on about physical activity (score 0-6) and behavior change techniques (BCTs) (score 0-18), fear-avoidance beliefs (score 8-48) and self-efficacy to guide behavior change (score 9-54) were assessed with a questionnaire. Structured logbooks were used to register PTs' self-reported guiding behavior. Criteria for PTs' adherence to the protocol were pre-set., RESULTS: PTs' knowledge on about BCTs and their self-efficacy increased significantly (p < 0.05) from median 9 to 13 and from median 38 to 46.5, respectively. Knowledge on about physical activity was high and fear-avoidance beliefs were low before the education (median 6 and 13.5, respectively) and did not change over time. Two out of ten PTs fulfilled the pre-set criteria for adherence throughout the intervention., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a theory-based skills training program improves PTs' knowledge on about behavior change techniques and their self-efficacy to guide people with RA to HEPA. PTs' adherence to the protocol was not complete but the clinical relevance of the adherence criteria need to be validated against observed PT behavior and patient outcomes."

9738021,,10.3899/jrheum.161270,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies combining biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD) to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have shown an increased risk of infection. However, the risk of infection with concurrent use of denosumab, a biologic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis, and a bDMARD remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the incidence of serious and opportunistic infections in patients treated concurrently with denosumab and a bDMARD and patients treated with a bDMARD alone., METHODS: A chart review of patients with RA from 2 Canadian rheumatology practices between July 1, 2010, and July 31, 2014, identified 2 groups of patients: those taking denosumab and a bDMARD concurrently (concurrent group) and those taking only a bDMARD (biologic-alone group). Patients were followed from the time of initiation of denosumab, or a matched index date for the biologic-alone group, to the end of the study or loss to followup. Instances of serious or opportunistic infections were recorded., RESULTS: A total of 308 patients (n = 102 for the concurrent group and n = 206 for the biologic-alone group) were evaluated. Within the concurrent group, 3 serious infection events occurred. Within the biologic-alone group, 4 serious infection events and 1 opportunistic infection event occurred. In both groups, all patients with serious or opportunistic infection recovered, and there were no instances of death during the study period., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a low occurrence of serious and opportunistic infections in patients with RA taking bDMARD, including patients with concurrent denosumab use."

9738066,,10.1136/gut.51.3.344,"Background and aims: Factors predisposing to endoscopic ulcer formation or healing with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have not been well defined. Methods: We used multivariate analysis of data from three large similar trials to identify factors associated with endoscopic lesions and healing. We compared the effectiveness of omeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg daily, misoprostol 200 mug four times daily, and ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in healing ulcers and erosions at different sites and in patients who were Helicobacter pylori positive and negative. Results: Older age, past ulcer history, rheumatoid arthritis, and H pylori infection were significantly associated with ulcers. Duodenal ulcer was significantly more likely than gastric ulcer with a past ulcer history (odds ratio 1.59, 1.16-2.17), H pylori infection (1.4, 1.04-1.92), and male sex (2.35, 1.75-3.16) while female sex, older age (>=60 years: 1.39, 1.03-1.88), and higher NSAID dose (>1 defined daily dose: 1.57, 1.16-2.14) were associated with gastric ulceration. Sex differences were seen in both H pylori positive and negative patients. Gastric and duodenal ulcer healing was significantly faster with omeprazole 20 mg than with misoprostol 200 mug four times daily or ranitidine 150 mg twice daily although misoprostol was more effective at healing erosions. Gastric ulcer healing was slower with large ulcers (0.37, 0.25-0.54 for >10 mm v 5-10 mm) or a past ulcer history (0.51, 0.34-0.76), and faster with H pylori infection (1.55, 1.06-2.29), especially with acid suppression (72% v 37% at four weeks with ranitidine). Conclusions: Among NSAID users, H pylori and male sex independently increase the likelihood of duodenal ulceration. H pylori infection does not affect duodenal ulcer healing and enhances gastric ulcer healing by ranitidine and possibly other acid suppressing treatments."

This study aims to determine whether a technology-enabled counselling intervention can improve physical activity participation and patient outcomes. Methods: the Effectiveness of Online Physical Activity Monitoring in Inflammatory Arthritis (OPAM-IA) project is a community-based randomized controlled trial with a delayed control design. We will recruit 130 people with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, who can be physically active without health professional supervision. Randomization will be stratified by diagnosis. In Weeks 1-8, participants in the Immediate Group will: 1) receive education and counselling by a physical therapist (PT), 2) use a Fitbit and a new web-based application, FitViz, to track and obtain feedback about their physical activity, 3) receive 4 biweekly follow-up calls from the PT. Those in the Delayed Group will receive the same program in Week 10. We will interview a sample of participants about their experiences with the intervention. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and Weeks 9, 18 and 27. The primary outcome measure is time spent in moderate/vigorous physical activity in bouts of >=10min, measured with a portable multi-sensor device in the free-living environment. Secondary outcomes include step count, time in sedentary behaviour, pain, fatigue, mood, self-management capacity, and habitual behaviour. Discussion: a limitation of this study is that participants, who also administer the outcome measures, will not be blinded. Nonetheless, by customizing existing self-monitoring technologies in a patient-centred manner, individuals can be coached to engage in an active lifestyle and monitor their performance. The results will determine if this intervention improves physical activity participation. The qualitative interviews will also provide insight into a paradigm to integrate this program to support self-management. Copyright ¬© 2017 The Author(s)"

One of the plants used for this purpose in the traditional medicine is Trachyspermum ammi. The present study aimed at investigating the anti-inflammatory effect of this plant on type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in Wistar rats., Materials and Methods: The study was performed on 35 male Wistar rats. Seven rats were considered as the healthy control group (normal group), and CIA was stablished in the rest. The rats with a model of inflammatory arthritis were divided into four groups. One group did not receive any treatment and three groups were treated orally with ibuprofen (15 mg/kg), aqueous extract of the T. ammi seeds (100 mg/kg), or their combination for 30 days. The effect of different treatments was investigated on the paw thickness, arthritis score, and mRNA level of COX2 and iNOS genes., Results: CIA increased paw thickness, arthritis score, and COX2 and iNOS mRNA levels compared to those of the normal group. Treatment with ibuprofen and aqueous extract alone or in combination reduced the studied variables. Reduction in the paw thickness, arthritis score, and iNOS mRNA level was more in the ibuprofen-treated group than the T. ammi extract-treated group, but treatment with T. ammi extract reduced COX2 mRNA level more than ibuprofen., Conclusion: It seems that the aqueous extract of T. ammi can be used alone or in combination with ibuprofen to treat RA.

Although tildrakizumab is not metabolized by, and does not alter, cytochrome P450 (CYP) expression in vitro, clinically significant pharmacokinetic effects through changes in systemic inflammation, which alters CYP metabolism, have been well documented. At the time of study conduct, the effect of modulation of inflammation/cytokines, including IL-23 inhibition with tildrakizumab, on CYP metabolism, and therefore the potential for disease-drug interactions, in psoriasis patients was unknown. We therefore assessed whether tildrakizumab alters CYP metabolism in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis., METHODS: This was an open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period trial. In Period 1 (Day 1), subjects received an oral CYP probe cocktail of up to five drugs (midazolam 2 mg [3A4], caffeine 200 mg [1A2], warfarin 10 mg [2C9], omeprazole 40 mg [2C19] and dextromethorphan 30 mg [2D6]), followed by a 7-day washout. In Period 2, subjects received tildrakizumab 200 mg subcutaneously on Days 1 and 29 and a second CYP probe cocktail on Day 57. Substrate or metabolite pharmacokinetics, safety and changes in Psoriasis Severity Area Index (PASI), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), were assessed., RESULTS: Twenty subjects (13 men, 7 women) were enrolled. Tildrakizumab had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of any of the probe substrates tested. On Day 57 of Period 2, the median percentage decrease from baseline in PASI score following tildrakizumab was ~93%. There were no clinically relevant changes in IL-6 or hs-CRP. Treatment with tildrakizumab was generally well tolerated., CONCLUSION: In subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis, tildrakizumab 200 mg did not have a discernible effect on CYP metabolism. The potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with tildrakizumab in patients with psoriasis is low. The difference in the occurrence of DDIs seen with anti-inflammatory agents in rheumatoid arthritis patients compared with psoriasis patients may be due to the much greater extent of systemic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis as compared to psoriasis.

Left untreated, MG symptoms may cause significant morbidity or even death. To date, no robust biological marker is available to follow the course of the disease. Therefore, new diagnostic approaches and biological markers are essential not only for improved diagnosis of the disease but for improved outcomes., OBJECTIVES: The present study applied a two-control, multi-label metabolomics profiling approach as a potential strategy for the identification of biomarkers unique to myasthenia gravis (MG)., METHODS: Metabolic analyses using acid- and dansyl-labelled serum from seropositive MG (n = 46), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 23) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 49) were performed on samples from adult patients presenting to the University of Alberta Hospital neuromuscular and rheumatology clinics. Comparisons between patients with MG vs. HC, and RA vs. HC were made using univariate and multivariate statistics., RESULTS: Serum biomarker patterns were statistically significantly different between groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models exhibited considerable distinction between all groups. Metabolites were then filtered to remove peak pairs common to both disease cohorts. Combined metabolite panels revealed clear separation between MG and HC for both library-matched (AUROC: 0.92 +/- 0.03) and highest AUC patients (AUROC: 0.94 +/- 0.05)., CONCLUSION: In patients presenting to the clinic with seropositive MG, metabolomic profiling is capable of distinguishing patients with disease from those without. These results provide an important first step towards a potential biomarker for improving MG identification."

Adult patients with RA received two injections of SB4 via the PFS, followed by six injections by the AI every week, up to 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in injection site pain score immediately post-injection from week 1 (PFS) to week 3 (AI). Injection site pain after 15-30 min post-injection, overall impression, and preference for PFS and AI were also assessed. Safety was assessed up to 11 weeks after the first injection., RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were enrolled and 52 patients (96.3%) completed the 8-week treatment period. The mean difference in pain scores between PFS and AI was - 0.057 and the 95% CI of the difference was [- 0.63, 0.51], which was within the equivalence margin of +/- 5.

This randomized controlled clinical trial aims to shed some light on the therapeutic benefits of RSV in the treatment of RA in patients with different stages of the disease activity. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 100 RA patients (68 female, 32 male) were enrolled randomly and divided into two groups, each of 50 patients: an RSV-treated group that received a daily RSV capsule of 1 g with the conventional treatment for 3 months and a control group that just received the regular treatment. The clinical and biochemical markers of RA in both groups were assessed. It was found that the clinical markers (i.e., the 28-joint count for swelling and tenderness) and the disease activity score assessment for 28 joints were significantly lowered in the RSV-treated group. Moreover, serum levels of certain biochemical markers (i.e., C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, undercarboxylated osteocalcin, matrix metalloproteinase-3, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-6) were also significantly decreased in RSV-treated patients.

The primary end point was the proportion of patients receiving tocilizumab at 6 months. Secondary end points were treatment patterns, effectiveness, and safety of tocilizumab over 12 months., RESULTS: Of 200 patients who initiated tocilizumab (91.0% at 8 mg/kg), 67 (33.5%) received tocilizumab monotherapy and 133 (66.5%) received tocilizumab combined with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated that 85% (95% CI 74-92%) of monotherapy and 89% (95% CI 82-93%) of combination therapy patients continued to receive tocilizumab at 6 months (log-rank p = 0.0888). During the observation period, 12 (17.9%) monotherapy and 27 (20.3%) combination therapy patients withdrew from the study. At month 12, 58.5% in the monotherapy group and 59.3% in the combination therapy group achieved Disease Activity Score at 28 joints remission (<= 2.6), 25.6% and 24.7% achieved Simplified Disease Activity Index remission (<= 3.3), and 18.2% and 22.3% achieved Clinical Disease Activity Index remission (<= 2.8), respectively. Rates of serious adverse events and serious infections were found in 29.6/100 patient-years (PY) and 3.1/100 PY, respectively, for monotherapy and 19.2/100 PY and 4.8/100 PY, respectively, for combination therapy., CONCLUSIONS: Patients initiating tocilizumab in routine practice had comparable effectiveness and safety outcomes regardless of whether they received tocilizumab as monotherapy or as combination therapy with csDMARDs., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01613378 FUNDING: F.

It is affecting approximately 1% of the population worldwide. The safety and therapeutic efficacy of beta-D-mannuronic acid (M2000) as a novel NSAID with immunosuppressive property has been demonstrated under invitro ,invivo examinations and clinical trials phase 1/11 in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients in addition to phase I/11 and 111 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)patients. In this study, our goal is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of oral administration of M2000 on gene expression of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2, MMP9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP1, TIMP2) as inflammatory molecules in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. The study has included 15 RA patients who had an insufficient response to the conventional drug. Therefore, mannuronic acid was used as an additive to the conventional regime. The research was a single-blinded study. The dose of M2000 was 500mg orally twice per day for 12 weeks. There were 15 healthy participants considered as control. Blood samples have been collected from both groups once from the healthy control and twice from RA patients before and after treatment with M2000. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated for assessment the gene expression level of MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2 using the real-time PCR method. Results: The gene expression level of MMP2 and MMP9 reported a significant reduction in RA patients after treatment with M2000 compared to before treatment. On the other hand, the gene expression level of TIMP2 demonstrated a significant increase in RA patients after treatment with mannuronic acid compared to before treatment, but there was no significant difference between the group of RA patients before treatment and the control group. Vice versa to other molecules, there was no significant difference in the level of TIMP1 in compression with RA patients before and after treatment. Conclusion ; our findings proved that the beta -D- mannuronic acid) as a novel NSAID with immunosuppressive property has a significant effect on the gene expression level of MMP2, MMP9 and TIMP2 molecules in RA patients.

There is a need for novel approaches to classify patients with these conditions. Herein we explored whether urinary proteomic biomarkers specific for different forms of arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), osteoarthritis (OA)) or chronic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)) can be identified. Fifty subjects per group with RA, PsA, OA or IBD and 50 healthy controls were included in the study. Two-thirds of these populations were randomly selected to serve as a training set, while the remaining one-third was reserved for validation. Sequential comparison of one group to the other four enabled identification of multiple urinary peptides significantly associated with discrete pathological conditions. Classifiers for the five groups were developed and subsequently tested blind in the validation test set. Upon unblinding, the classifiers demonstrated excellent performance, with an area under the curve between 0.90 and 0.97 per group. Identification of the peptide markers pointed to dysregulation of collagen synthesis and inflammation, but also novel inflammatory markers. We conclude that urinary peptide signatures can reliably differentiate between chronic arthropathies and inflammatory conditions with discrete pathogenesis."

The aim of treatment is to improve the health-related quality of life (QoL) of patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the QoL of patients with RA in Northeast China and analyze its influencing factors., METHODS: The study group consisted of 200 patients diagnosed with RA. The control group consisted of 200 healthy subjects. All subjects were residents in Northeast China. The investigation was conducted by questionnaire survey and electronic medical record. The WHOQOL-BREF, The Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and Quality of Life Instruments for Chronic Diseases-RA (QLICD-RA) were used as questionnaires., RESULTS: The QoL scores acquired by SF-36, WHOQOL-BREF and QLICD-RA scales showed significant differences between RA and control groups (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that sleep duration (P = 0.001), psychological counseling (P < 0.001) and C4 level (P = 0.001) influenced the SF-36 scale evaluation model. IgA levels (P < 0.001) and being overweight (P = 0.030) were included in the WHOQOL-BREF evaluation model. Adequate sleep (P = 0.001) and psychological counseling(P = 0.050) entered the QLICD-RA scale evaluation model (P = 0.050), in which psychological counseling, normal C4 levels and being overweight were protective factors for RA, insufficient sleep and IgA levels were risk factors for RA., CONCLUSIONS: The QoL of RA patients is generally lower than those of healthy subjects in the Northeast China, Northeast China.

As physical exercise is one of the pillars in primary and secondary prophylaxis of cardiovascular events, we evaluated whether the combination of resistance and aerobic exercises is able to increase aerobic capacity and quality of life and to improve echocardiographic parameters and the metabolic profile of patients with this rheumatic disease. Method(s): 60 women with pSS (age 18-90 years) were evaluated from the SF-36 Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) questionnaires. The participants performed ergospirometry in an electromagnetic braking cycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur Sport, Groningen, The Netherlands), coupled to a computerized gas analyzer (Quark CPET, Cosmed, Italy) and echocardiography on the Philips IE33 device; blood samples were collected to evaluate the metabolic profile (glycemia, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol and fractions) by the central laboratory of the Hospital Sao Paulo - UNIFESP. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a training group (30 patients) that participated in the supervised training program and a control group (30 patients) that did not participate in the program. All variables were analyzed at baseline and after 28 weeks for both groups. The training program was divided into two phases according to the nature of the exercise. The first stage consisted of 16 weeks of resistance exercises, in the form of a 45 minute circuit, and each muscle group was exercised in 3 sets of 12 repetitions each. From the seventeenth week, the exercise became aerobic, performed on an electromagnetic braking cycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur Sport, Groningen, The Netherlands), the same instrument used to perform the ergospirometric test. The intensity and duration of the training increased progressively, until the last 3 weeks with sessions of 50 minutes and intensity of 60 to 84% of the VO2max. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon's rank sum test, chi-square test, and ANOVA test. P values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): The 2 groups were homogeneous and comparable at baseline. The training group showed a significant improvement in aerobic capacity measured by oxygen maximum volume (VO2max) (19.64 +/- 3.47vs 22.95 +/- 4.01, p <0.001) and by anaerobic threshold VVO2 (16.86 +/- 2.86 vs 19.56 +/- 3.18, p <0.001) Comparison of the training group and control group after 28 weeks showed a significant difference relating to VO2max [F (1; 58) = 31.43; p <0.001] and in the anaerobic threshold VVO2 [F (1; 58) = 5.41; p <0.001] After cardiovascular training, we found a small but significant decrease in glycated hemoglobin (5.88 +/- 0.73 vs 5.75 +/- 0.66, p = 0.006). We did not find statistically significant difference in echocardiographic parameters, lipemic profile, quality of life (SF-36) and disease activity (ESSDAI).

The disease over the course of time, leads to joint deformity and disability. The disease ranks third as major cause of disability after osteoarthritis and gout and affects roughly 1% of global population. Decrease mobility in patients results in decreased productivity and further worsens their quality of life. While pharmacological treatment may be essential in managing the acute flares and episodic pain associated with the disease, self-care and home-based management of RA is another important area of care which patients need to incorporate to manage it effectively.
 Several studies have reported that self-care in RA effectively reduces acute flares. This could be done through the use of patient education and counselling. Pharmacist provide pharmaceutical care that incorporates these areas of care. Pharmaceutical care is an individualized patient-centric health service delivered by pharmacists that incorporates, but is not limited to, disease education, therapy management, self-care and self-management of disease and therapy as well as motivational guidance.
 Evidence from several randomized trials indicate that patient counselling, disease education and telephonic interventions have improved self-care practices of patients. Educating patients about managing RA empowers them in understanding signs and symptoms of disease and devise ways to reduce or limit aggravating factors. A randomized trial conducted by Petkova that involved community pharmacy-based patient education program improved treatment outcomes of arthritis patients. Moreover, Mary and colleagues demonstrated positive effect of mobile phone short message service on medication adherence of patients with RA.
 In the last decade there has been only few studies that have evaluated the impact of pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care on treatment outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In Pakistan, no study has been conducted till date that evaluates the same. Since, the disease prevalence has increased in Pakistani population of late, and mainly affects the middle-aged individuals, it is expected to affect their productivity, employ-ability and income. This would worsen their health-related quality of life and adds to economic burden of this disease on the society. Therefore, a need was felt to evaluate the impact of pharmacist-delivered pharmaceutical care on treatment outcomes in Pakistani patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

Secondary objectives aimed to describe the characteristics of patients and disease, the effectiveness at 12 months after switching, the therapeutic maintenance, and to search for predictive factors of switching., METHODS: We analyzed all the RA patients of the shared medical file ""RIC Nord de France"", treated with tocilizumab, switching or not from intravenous to subcutaneous tocilizumab, between April 2015 and January 2016. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the proportion of patients remaining in their DAS28-ESR category remission/low disease activity (LDA) or moving to an inferior DAS28-ESR category at 6 months. Since RoSwitch was an observational study, without randomization, a propensity score was built in a sensitivity analysis to balance on RA and patients' characteristics at inclusion between switching and no-switching groups., RESULTS: An improvement of initial DAS28-ESR category or maintenance in DAS28-ESR remission/LDA at 6 months was shown in 203 of the 285 patients with an evaluation for the primary criterion (71.2%, 95% CI [65.6-76.4%]) without differences between groups (73.3%, 95% CI [63.0-82.1%] vs. 70.3%, 95% CI [63.3-76.6%]). The RoSwitch study showed the maintenance of effectiveness at 6 and 12 months. Similar therapeutic maintenance rates were observed for switch and no-switch patients.

The only current treatments for haemorrhagic stroke are aimed at significantly reducing the blood pressure and reversing the action of any anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) where necessary. Surgery to remove the blood clot is not an option for all participants and the benefits of this are not clear.
 The investigators research group has extensively investigated the use of a well-established anti-inflammatory drug, Kineret¬Æ in trials with participants who have suffered a stroke or brain haemorrhage. Kineret¬Æ is similar to a naturally-produced protein called interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and is already licensed to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The investigators have evidence from these previous studies that Kineret¬Æ reduced levels of inflammation in the blood after ischaemic stroke (caused by a blockage in an artery). In another trial, the investigators collected samples of the haematoma blot clot removed during surgery in 47 participants who had suffered a haemorrhagic stroke. These participants were taking part in a trial of 'keyhole' surgery as a treatment for haemorrhagic stroke. The investigators found that higher levels of naturally occurring IL-1Ra in and around the haematoma blood clot is linked to less brain swelling a few days later. This suggests that Kineret¬Æ may reduce swelling in the brain after haemorrhagic stroke. However, in order to develop Kineret¬Æ as a treatment for haemorrhagic stroke, the investigators need to know if it reduces levels of inflammation present in the blood and if it reduces swelling in the brain.
 The investigators also want to investigate whether blocking inflammation can improve outcomes following ICH. If the results of this trial show promise, it could support the decision to run a much larger trial to establish whether lowering inflammation improves recovery after haemorrhagic stroke.
 Patients admitted to a neurosurgical centre within 8 hours of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) on brain imaging will be considered for study participation. Potential participants will be identified by the clinical team and will be referred to the research teams at the sites following usual and established pathways. These pathways may include potential participants being identified by; (i) Screening the acute referral databases/medical records, (ii) Attendance at ward round and, (iii) Referral by Accident and Emergency team. All members of the research teams at the sites have an existing working relationship with the clinical teams and are employed by the research site (hospital Trust). This procedure is employed at sites in order to identify potential participants for all acute and hyper acute research studies.
 Capacity to consent may be an issue within this patient group. An appropriately trained member of the research team will carry out a formal assessment of capacity, where appropriate. Where it is not possible to obtain consent from the patient due to lack of capacity, the investigators will seek consent from their personal legal representative. If the patient lacks capacity to consent to participation and no personal legal representative exists, the decision to include the patient will be made by a senior member of the clinical team who is independent of the research team (professional legal representative).
 In the event that a patient has the capacity to consent to participation, but is unable to complete and sign the relevant consent form due to physical difficulties resulting from their clinical condition or pre-existing physical impairments (e.g. visual difficulties or limb weaknesses), witnessed, verbal consent will be obtained. The patient will be asked to orally confirm their willingness to participate in each stage of the trial to the professional legal representative (most likely a member of the clinical team independent of the research group) who will then be asked to confirm this consent in writing. In the event that the physical difficulties resolve during the patient's inclusion in the trial, a further consent form will be completed.
 Where initial consent is obtained from the patient's personal legal representative or the professional legal representative, the capacity of the patient to consent will be reassessed before each research assessment/intervention. If the patient regains capacity, they will be given information about the trial and asked to confirm willingness to continue trial participation by signing a consent form. Where initial consent is given by the patient, it will be made clear that they will remain in the trial should capacity be lost unless the decision to withdraw them is made by their representative, the research team, or by their clinical team.
 Consent to trial participation will include sharing of personal contact data with the trial centre in order to conduct follow up assessment and the optional consent to storage of blood samples for use in other ethically-approved research.
 Following consent, the research nurse will conduct an initial 'baseline' assessment. This will be written in the medical notes and also in an individual research file (Case Report Form). This first assessment will record details of how well the patient was at the time of inclusion in the trial as well as how well they were in the 3 months before stroke. The assessment will also record information such as age, sex and ethnicity and past medical history (including recent infections, previous stroke, risk factors, medications and vaccinations). A physical examination will record measurements of temperature, heart rate and blood pressure. A similar assessment will be repeated on each of the following 4 days after symptom-onset. The final assessment will be completed the morning after the final injection has been given. After this assessment the research team will ask the patient to verbally reconfirm consent that contact details can be passed to the coordinating centre (Chief Investigator's Team at University of Manchester) In addition to the baseline assessment, a research blood sample will be obtained to measure levels of inflammation at baseline. This blood sample will be up to 10ml (2 teaspoons) and will be taken from existing venous lines (where possible) to minimise discomfort for the participant.
 After obtaining the baseline blood samples and baseline assessments, the participant will be randomised to treatment arm or placebo. The system will generate a unique participant identification number which will be used on all documentation from this point to identify subsequent samples, for communications and for data collection purposes. First dose of trial medication must be delivered within 8 hours of ICH and as soon as possible after randomisation.
 Participants will receive 6 injections of identical doses of Trial Drug (Kineret¬Æ or placebo) over 3 days after ICH. However, only half the participants will receive Kineret¬Æ and the other half will receive placebo (dummy drug). The investigators will measure and compare levels of inflammation in the blood of both groups of participants before and after treatment with Trial Drug to assess if inflammation is lower in those who receive Kineret¬Æ compared to those given placebo. The investigators will also assess all brain imaging performed on trial participants in both treatment groups during their in-patient stay to see if there are differences in the number showing signs of further bleeding and brain swelling. If the results of this trial show promise, it could support the decision to run a much larger trial to establish whether lowering inflammation improves recovery after ICH.
 At approximately 3 days after randomisation, the patient will undergo a repeat CT brain scan as part of the research trial. This scan is the same type as the one performed at admission. Although this scan is being performed as part of the research trial, the results will also be available to the doctors looking after the patient and may assist them in deciding on specific treatments. This scan will take approximately 10 minutes to perform but the participant may be away from the ward or department for up to 45 minutes. The scan will be used by the researchers who will compare it to brain imaging performed on admission to hospital.
 In addition to the CT scan, participants may also be asked to undergo a Magnetic Resonance (MR) brain scan between 2-4 days from the onset of the stroke symptoms. This is optional and is dependent on availability of hospital scan appointments. Members of the research team at the recruiting hospital will record everything that happens to the patient during their in-patient stay. At 30 days after randomisation, participants will be followed up to further check their well-being. If the patient is still in hospital on this date, this assessment may be performed face-to-face by a member of the research team. However, if the participant has been discharged home or returned to their local hospital, the researcher will perform this assessment by telephone with the participant or their relative/friend if they are not able or their local healthcare provider. It is expected that this assessment will take around 45 minutes.
 The participant will be contacted again by telephone at approximately 90 days (3 months) by a member of the research team at the trial coordinating centre in Manchester. This assessment will assess the participant's recovery after ICH and will include questions about their mood, level of fatigue and quality of life. It is expected that this assessment will take around 45 minutes. If for any reason, the participant is unable to complete this assessment, a member of their family may answer the questions on their behalf.
 This will complete the patient's participation in the trial. With the participant's permission, the researchers at the recruiting hospital will contact the participant's family doctor (GP), Consultant and any other Health Care Professional involved in their care to let them know of the patient's participation in the trial."

Current therapies are relatively effective and sometimes harmful. Royal Jelly with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties may be used as an adjunct therapy. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Royal Jelly on Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and morning stiffness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 classification criteria, 80 patients with RA, who had active disease (CDAI > 2.8), were randomly assigned to receive Royal Jelly or placebo beside background treatment for 3 months. Morning stiffness, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), evaluator global assessment (EGA) and patient's global assessment (PGA) [based on visual analogue scale (VAS)] were determined before and after 3 months of intervention. The changes in aforementioned indexes were analyzed by SPSS software. Findings: 65 patients completed the study (35 in Royal Jelly and 30 in placebo group). The sex, age, residence, disease duration and drug consumption had no significant changes (P > 0.050). In the first group, CDAI (P = 0.012), SJC (P = 0.024), TJC (P = 0.027), and morning stiffness (P = 0.004) had significant statistical changes; but only changes in morning stiffness were statistically different between the two groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: royal Jelly has good effect on morning stiffness but not on CDAI and may be a suitable adjunct therapy. Further studies may demonstrate more significant results"

A post-hoc analysis of two randomized controlled trials was used to investigate the effects of temporary MTX discontinuation (for 2 weeks or 4 weeks) on responses to seasonal influenza vaccination. The impact of MTX discontinuation on the RA disease activity score (DAS28) and RA flare rate during discontinuation and after reintroduction was examined. The DAS28 increased during the 4-week MTX discontinuation period, before returning to baseline after reintroduction. The overall flare-free survival period did not differ between the groups (log rank p = 0.142). However, during the 4-week MTX discontinuation period, more patients in the MTX-hold group than in the MTX-continue group experienced a flare (20.5% vs. 7.4%, respectively; p = 0.058). After resumption of MTX, the flare rate did not differ between groups. The flare rates in the MTX-continue group and the 2-week and 4-week MTX-hold groups were 5.8%, 10.8% and 20.5%, respectively (p < 0.01). The change in the DAS28 from baseline did not differ significantly between the MTX-continue and the 2-week MTX-discontinue groups. However, there was a significant difference between the 4-week MTX-hold group and the MTX-continue group (p = 0.005). Short-term discontinuation of MTX for up to 2 weeks is safe, whereas discontinuation for 4 weeks is associated with a transient increase in disease flares and activity in RA patients taking a stable MTX dose.Key Points* Methotrexate discontinuation for 2 weeks is safe.* Methotrexate discontinuation for 4 weeks transiently increases flare risk and disease activity.* Disease flare risk and disease activity return to baseline after restarting methotrexate treatment."

The aims of this study were to assess the impact of Ramadan fasting on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) activity and to assess its impact on chronic medications intake in patients with rheumatic diseases. Method(s): This prospective monocentric study included patients with RA or SpA who fasted during Ramadan of 2019. The disease activity and the managing of chronic medications were assessed and compared between two visits: the first one 6 months before starting Ramadan fasting and the second after fasting at least 7 days. Result(s): Fifty-six patients were included: 36 with RA (average age 57.5 +/- 10.9 years) and 20 with SpA (average age 47 +/- 12.6 years). In the RA group, the Disease Activity Scores (DAS) 28 ESR, and DAS 28 CRP decreased after fasting respectively from 4.3 +/- 1.3 to 3.5 +/- 1.4 (p < 0.001) and from 3.4 +/- 1.2 to 2.9 +/- 1.3 (p = 0.001). In the SpA group, Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Scores (ASDAS) ESR and ASDAS CRP decreased respectively from 2.3 +/- 0.5 to 1.9 +/- 0.7 (p = 0.039) and from 1.9 +/- 0.5 to 1.8 +/- 0.8 (p = 0.388). Fasting did not affect significantly either compliance with chronic medications or tolerance. Conclusion(s): Fasting can be a possible way to induce rapid improvement of rheumatic diseases activity. In addition, patients with a specific fear of drug intake during this period can be reassured, which will enhance the adherence to treatment.Key Points* Fasting during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, consists of intermittent fasting observed from sunrise to sunset.* In this set of patients, beneficial effects of intermittent fasting were demonstrated on RA activity, but were less evident in patients with SpA despite a general trend towards improvement.* Fasting did not affect significantly either compliance with chronic medications or tolerance.Copyright ¬© 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR)."

The purpose of this study was investigating the effects of strength training on pain and disease activity in women with primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS) Metodology: blind randomized controlled clinical trial, including 59 women diagnosed with pSS according to ""European-American Consensus Group Criteria"", allocated in two groups: control (30) and exercise (29). Both maintained drug treatment and the exercise group added sixteen weeks of strenght training for one hour, twice a week. The evaluation was performed using the Visual Analogue Scale of Pain (VAS) and the Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI). Results: we did not find significant differences between the means of the groups at the initial moment (p intergroup = 0.778), but the mean of the control group at the final moment was significantly higher than the mean of the intervention group (p-intergroup <0.001).

In addition, to create a culturally adapted American English (AmE) FLARE-RA questionnaire and to examine its attributes of patient-reported RA flare status., METHODS: Using standardized cultural adaptation guidelines, we cognitively debriefed 25 American English speaking rheumatoid arthritis (RA) outpatients and created AmE-FLARE-RA with their input. One hundred three additional RA patients were recruited. Patients completed the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), patient global visual analogue scale (VAS), AmE-FLARE-RA, and self-reports of flare. Physician global VAS, physician-assessed flare, swollen and tender joint count (TJC), and clinical disease activity index (CDAI) were documented. AmE-FLARE-RA and disease activity measures were compared between patient-reported and physician-reported flare categories., RESULTS: Patients were female (89%), with mean (SD) age 51.1 (+/- 15.3) years and mean disease duration (SD) 11.9 (+/- 10.1) years, with 26% in remission/low disease activity. Total AmE-FLARE-RA scores, RAPID3, CDAI, and patient global VAS were significantly higher for both patient-reported flares and physician-reported flares compared with non-flaring patients by self- or physician report (p < 0.05). Total AmE-FLARE-RA scores correlated significantly with RAPID3 (corr = 0.50, p < 0.0001) and with CDAI (corr = 0.45, p < 0.0001).

AmE-FLARE-RA significantly correlated with RAPID3 and CDAI and distinguished between patient-reported and physician-reported flares, making it useful to detect flares in American RA patients.Key Points* The American English FLARE-RA (AmE-FLARE-RA) questionnaire is the result of cognitive debriefing with American RA patients using the British English version of the validated French FLARE-RA and incorporates patient-recommended language modifications..* Patients self-reporting flares had significantly higher AmE-FLARE-RA scores, compared with those without flares at the time of visit. AmE-FLARE-RA scores correlate with RAPID3 and CDAI.* There was a non-statistically significant trend using the AmE-FLARE-RA scores when examining patients with no flare, one flare, or several flares.* AmE-FLARE-RA total scores are uniformly elevated (~ 6.0 on a 0-10 scale), regardless of discordance between patient and MD assessment of flare at time of visit (~ 30%)."

This case-control study was carried out at Zagazig University Hospitals on 99 subjects divided randomly into two groups; 48 RA patients and 51 controls. RA patients fulfilled the revised 2010 EULAR/ACR classification criteria of RA. All patients were subjected to history taking, clinical evaluation, laboratory investigations & plain X-rays. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and PON1 enzyme assay & genotyping were done for both groups. PON1 enzyme levels were significantly higher in patients than controls. Also, there was a significant negative correlation of PON1 enzyme activity with increased CIMT & plaques. The cut-off value of PON1 enzyme level that had the highest CVD prediction was 4.2 U/ml. Although PON1 genotyping was insignificantly different between patients and controls, patients with QQ genotype had the lowest PON1 activity then patients with QR genotype then RR genotype. In RA patients, decreased serum PON1 enzymatic activity and QQ genotyping of Q192R PON polymorphism was associated with increased CIMT & plaques.

There is, however, a possible deleterious interaction between aspirin and NSAIDs on CVD that requires further research. Aspirin, NSAIDs, and to a lesser extent COX-2 inhibitors are associated with increased gastrointestinal side effects and bleeding, alone and in combination.

Linear regression modeled the effect of biologic exposure on changes in disease activity (Disease Activity Score-28 with C-reactive protein [DAS28-CRP]), functional status (modified Health Assessment Questionnaire [mHAQ]), and RA severity (Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data [RAPID3]). Biologic exposure was the ratio of time on a biologic relative to time participating in the BRASS cohort., RESULTS: The analysis included 1395 RA patients, 82.3% female, with 6783 unique study visits from 2003 to 2015. At the patient's first visit, mean (SD) age was 56.3 (14.2) years and mean (SD) duration of RA was 12.7 (11.9) years. Average follow-up duration was 5.59 years (range, 1-13).

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant and antiinflammatory agent which demonstrated analgesic effects in some studies. This study is designed to assess the effects of oral NAC as an adjuvant therapy on the clinical outcomes of patients with active RA., METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 51 RA patients with active RA were studied in 2 groups: NAC group (27 patients) received standard treatment of RA and 600 mg NAC twice a day for 12 weeks, and placebo group (24 patients) received the standard treatment of RA and placebo. Disease activity score (DAS28) was used to assess the activity of RA, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for the severity of pain, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) for the patients' physical performance, and Global Health (GH) parameter for the patients' assessment of their disease activity. The number of tender and swollen joints and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were also determined for each patient. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 (Chicago, IL, USA)., RESULTS: After 12 weeks of intervention, there were no significant differences between two groups in DAS28 score and ESR (P values were 0.4 and 0.6, respectively). However, GH, VAS, and HAQ scores were improved significantly in the NAC group compared to the placebo group., CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that oral administration of NAC may be associated with improving health status in RA patients and considered as an adjuvant therapy in these patients. Further studies with larger sample size, longer study duration and higher doses of NAC are needed to confirm the effects of oral NAC in RA patients.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using longitudinal prescription drug claims data from IQVIA Private Drug Plan database (PDP), Ontario Public Drug Plan database (OPDP), and Regie de l'assurance maladie du Quebec database (RAMQ). Between 07/2008 and 06/2010, bio-naive patients who initiated etanercept were identified and followed for 72 months. Twelve-month retention rates were estimated in one-year increments and factors associated with time to discontinuation over the 72-month period were identified using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The study identified 4528 etanercept patients (61% female, 85% rheumatic diseases, and 15% psoriasis). Twelve-month etanercept retention rates increased significantly for patients following their first year on therapy (p < 0.0001), with 66% of patients retained at year 1 vs. 79, 82, 84, 83, and 79% at years 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. 17.1% (n = 771) of patients were retained for the entire 72-month study. Patients with psoriasis were at increased risk (HR 1.199; p < 0.0001); while public drug coverage plan patients (OPDP HR 0.721; p < 0.0001 and RAMQ HR 0.537; p < 0.0001) were at decreased risk of treatment discontinuation. Twelve-month etanercept retention rates increased significantly for patients following their first year on therapy. Indication and drug coverage plan were associated with patients' time to etanercept discontinuation.

In the 2017 ACR guideline for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, vitamin D intake of 600-800 IU/d is recommended. Considering that RA is prone to vitamin D deficiency, required dose of vitamin D might be higher in osteoporosis patients with RA. However, the optimal dose of vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis patients with RA is not well known. Thus, we aimed to assess the optimal dose of vitamin D supplementation in this patient group. Method(s): Patients with RA, who was diagnosed as osteoporosis (T-score <= -2.5) between January 2013 and December 2016 were included. We classified patients in to four groups according to the dose of vitamin D supplementation (0 IU/d, 400 IU/d, 800 IU/d, >=1000 IU/d). Clinical characteristics, dose of vitamin D supplementation and change in T-score during one year were reviewed and compared among these groups. Kruskal-Wallis test and Fisher's exact test were used for comparison of continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Result(s): In total, 116 osteoporosis patients with RA were included. Mean age was 63.8 (+/-8.7) years and 107 (92.2%) were female. None of the patients had thyroid disease or parathyroid disease. All patients received bisphosphonate for treatment of osteoporosis. In comparison among patients with different doses of vitamin D supplementation, age, sex, prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, RA disease activity, RA medication, BMI, and initial T-score did not significantly differ among groups. However, change of T-score in one year was greatest in the >=1000 IU/d group (p=0.003). Conclusion(s): In osteoporosis patients with RA, vitamin D supplementation of >1000 IU/day may be beneficial in terms of BMD. (Table Presented) ."

METHOD(S): A total of 76 of 156 patients with early RA in remission at 1 year and with available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data at baseline and at 12 months were included. Complete clinical and laboratory evaluations were conducted for the patients. MRI images were assessed according to the Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring (RAMRIS) system. Progression of bone erosions was defined as an increase of 1 or more units in annual RAMRIS score for erosions compared to baseline. RESULT(S): At 1 year, the majority of patients with RA in sustained remission showed some inflammatory activity on MRI (43.4% synovitis, 39.5% bone marrow edema (BME), and 9.2% tenosynovitis), and 25 of the 76 patients (32.9%) showed MRI progression of bone erosions. A significant difference was observed in MRI BME and bone erosion at 1 year, with higher mean score in patients with progression compared to non-progression of erosions (BME, 4.8+/-3.6 vs 3.1+/-2.1, P=0.01; bone erosion, 13.5+/-9.6 vs 4.4+/-3.6, P<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Persistent subclinical inflammations were shown in patients with sustained remission; BME in MRI may be a strong predictor of future radiographic progression of bone erosions in patients with persistent clinical remission."

For generic instruments, the states are generally not labelled by disease types to avoid negative perceptions being incorporated in the preferences. Disease-specific utility instruments tend to identify the disease, thereby incorporating any societal perceptions about that disease into the valuation. This study explores whether labelling a health state affects general population valuations. METHOD(S): An online panel of general population respondents (n = 800) were recruited to complete a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE was designed to evaluate individuals' preferences for different health scenarios pertaining to colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Half the participants were randomly selected to complete a four-attribute DCE (health state before treatment, health state after treatment, duration of life, and disease type). The remaining participants completed an identical DCE except that disease type was excluded. For these respondents, after they completed each choice set they were asked if they would change their answers if the corresponding disease label was applied. For each DCE version, a conditional logit model was used to determine the marginal utility weight for the attribute levels, from which trade-offs and marginal rates of substitution were calculated. RESULT(S): Relationships between personal utility and all attributes were in the hypothesized direction. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics between those completing either DCE version. When adjusted for the two versions, the labels associated with colorectal cancer (beta = -0.40, SE = 0.04, p<0) and type 2 diabetes (beta = 0.28, SE = 0.04, p<0) had an effect on the responses relative to RA. On average, the respondents were willing to forego 1.58 life-years for a health state to be labelled as diabetes rather than RA. Similarly, they would be willing to forego 2.25 life-years for RA rather than colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION(S): The provision of disease labels influenced general population respondent's valuations for a given health state. There was a clear ordering effect such that respondents preferred to have diabetes over RA, and for RA over colorectal cancer. This raises concerns regarding the use of disease-specific utility instruments for guiding difficult policy decisions."

We describe the drug's safety profile of the drug with updated data from an on-going long-term extension (LTE) study. Method(s): Long-term safety of once-daily BARI was evaluated in the ""all-BARI-RA"" dataset, which includes all patients (pts) with active RA exposed to any BARI dose from 8 randomized trials (4 Ph3, 3 Ph2, 1 Ph1b) and 1 LTE study (data up to 01-Sept-2016). Previous all-BARI-RA analyses were provided for comparison (data up to 10-Aug-2015). Placebo (PBO) comparisons were evaluated for up to Wk 24 in the ""PBO 4-mg"" dataset from the 6 Ph2/3 trials in which pts were randomized to BARI 4mg, with censoring at rescue or treatment switch. Dose responses were evaluated based on the 4 Ph2/3 trials in which pts were randomized to 2 or 4mg and includes data from the LTE (the ""2-4mg-extended"" dataset). Because of the latent period for malignancy, 2-4mg-extended was also analyzed without censoring for rescue or dose change (as-randomized analysis). Incidence rates (IRs) per 100 patient-years (PYs) were calculated. Result(s): In the current analysis, 3492 pts received BARI for 6637 total PYs of exposure (an increase of over 2400 PYs from previous analysis); maximum exposure was 5.5 yrs. No differences were seen for BARI 4mg vs PBO in adverse events (AEs) leading to permanent study drug discontinuation, death, malignancy, serious infection, or major adverse cardiovascular event. Herpes zoster IR was significantly higher for BARI 4mg vs PBO (IR 4.3 vs 1.0; 4mg vs. PBO, respectively). In 2-4mg-extended, no significant differences were observed comparing BARI 2 vs 4mg for the above-mentioned events. Malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) IRs were 0.5 and 1.3 for 2 and 4mg, respectively, with as-treated analysis and 0.7 and 0.9 with as-randomized analysis. The following IRs were observed in the current all-BARI-RA: lymphoma (0.09), gastrointestinal perforation (0.05), and tuberculosis (0.15, all in endemic areas). The IRs for these events were also similar to those previously reported. Fewer than 1% of pts discontinued due to abnormal laboratory results. Conclusion(s): Patients with moderately to severely active RA, including patients exposed for up to 5.5 years, baricitinib maintained a safety profile that was similar to that previously reported1 and acceptable in the context of demonstrated efficacy."

Bisphosphonates, the recently developed bone resorption inhibitors, have demonstrated significant therapeutic effects on senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid (ZOL), with or without methotrexate (MTX), for the prevention and treatment of bone destruction in RA patients. METHODS: we recruited 66 RA patients with symptoms of secondary osteoporosis. They were randomized into three treatment groups-combined treatment with MTX and ZOL, ZOL monotherapy, or MTX monotherapy-in two consecutive 6-month periods. The participants were followed for 12√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞months. At the end of each treatment period, improvement in disease activity, bone destruction, and fracture risk were evaluated. RESULTS: combined treatment with ZOL and MTX had significantly better clinical efficacy compared with either ZOL or MTX monotherapy (P < 0.05). The combination significantly improved the lumbar spine and hip BMD and reduced FRAX scores, suggesting that ZOL combined with MTX reduces bone loss and risk of hip fracture in RA patients with secondary osteoporosis. CONCLUSION: ZOL has a synergistic effect when combined with MTX, inhibiting RA disease activity, reducing fracture risk, and improving quality of life in RA patients with secondary osteoporosis.

At the end of the treatments, arthritic score was determined and then the animals were sacrificed. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum levels of HSP70, interleukin-17 (IL-17), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), rheumatic factor (RF), C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were determined., RESULTS: In the AR group, all parameters increased significantly, except for GPx, which showed a pronounced decrease. The 17-AAG and/or MTX treatments significantly reduced arthritic score, ESR, IL-17, TNF-alpha, RF, CRP, MDA, and MMP-9 with significant increase in GPx compared to the AR group. The HSP70 level was significantly higher in the AR + 17-AAG and the AR + 17-AAG + MTX groups but significantly lower in the AR + MTX group as compared to the AR group. Also, it was significantly lower in the AR + MTX group as compared to the AR + 17-AAG group., CONCLUSION: We concluded that HSP70 induction by 17-AAG attenuated the inflammatory process in a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model induced by collagen, which suggested that HSP70 inducers can be promising agents in the treatment of RA."

They were classified into remission and non-remission groups at 24 weeks of iguratimod therapy. Remission was defined as a state with a disease activity score (DAS) <2.6 in 28 joints (termed DAS remission) and total power Doppler ultrasound (US) score <3 (termed US remission). The serum MMP-3 levels at baseline and at 12 weeks were compared between these two groups., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the serum MMP-3 levels at baseline between the DAS and US remission groups and the non-remission group. The serum MMP-3 levels at 12 weeks in the US remission group were significantly lower than those in the non-remission group. The ratios of the serum MMP-3 levels at baseline to those at 12 weeks in both the DAS and US remission groups were significantly lower than those in the non-remission group. An MMP-3 ratio <0.86 was determined as the cut-off value to predict US remission at 24 weeks., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the ratios of the serum MMP-3 levels at baseline to those at 12 weeks could be used to predict remission in RA patients who are administered iguratimod as an add-on to bDMARDs."

Clinical observations often provide more accurate outcome data in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than clinical trials. Limitations of clinical trials to depict long-term outcomes in RA include a relatively short observation period, patient selection resulting from exclusion criteria, inflexible dosage schedules and concomitant drug therapies, evidence that some markers of inflammatory activity are suboptimal surrogate indicators of long-term articular damage, the fact that statistically significant results are not necessarily clinically important, the influence of the design on the results - despite a control group, ignoring of individual variation in reporting results, the non-standardized interpretation of side effects which introduces bias, distortion of the 'placebo effect', and lack of capacity to detect rare side effects. The clinical trial represents only an initial step in the evaluation of a therapy for a chronic disease. Awareness of these limitations should lead to the improved design of clinical trials and clinical studies to improve the long- term outcome for people with RA."

Our aim was to explore IA patients' perspectives on strategies to support medication adherence., Methods: We collaborated with a leading arthritis patient group and conducted a qualitative study on individuals with IA who were taking at least one medication for their IA. An experienced facilitator led participants through a focus group exercise where participants were asked to design, and then discuss, strategies and/or tools supporting medication use. We applied thematic analysis using an iterative, constant comparative approach., Results: We studied six focus groups with 27 participants diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and comparatively under-represented conditions in this research area such as Sjogren's syndrome. Five themes emerged throughout the analysis. Two themes - 1) adapting to life with IA and 2) the complexities and dynamic nature of taking medications - describe learning to live with a chronic condition and the challenges encountered when using long-term medications. Three themes - 3) developing lifestyle strategies for medication use (eg, having physical reminders and prompts), 4) becoming informed about medications (eg, information at time of diagnosis, means of receiving information) and 5) receiving support (eg, from health care team members, from family) - offer perspectives on facilitators to medication use. From the relationship between the latter themes, a framework was developed that encompasses means of receiving information and support as actionable targets for patient-oriented adherence interventions for IA., Conclusion: This patient-oriented study highlights the importance of developing timely adherence interventions for IA. Our findings also led to a framework describing means of receiving information, such as through digital media and support, including from health care team members and family, as actionable targets for patient-oriented adherence interventions for IA."

This work characterized upadacitinib population pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and RA patients and the effects of covariates on upadacitinib exposure., METHODS: Upadacitinib plasma concentrations (n = 6399) from 107 healthy subjects and 466 RA patients from three phase I and two 12-week RA phase IIb trials (1-48 mg immediate-release doses across studies) were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The models were qualified using bootstrap and stochastic simulations., RESULTS: A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination described upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. Estimates (95% bootstrap confidence interval) for upadacitinib oral clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, absorption lag time, and mean absorption time were 39.7 (37.8-41.5) L/h, 210 (196-231) L, 0.48 (0.47-0.49) h, and 0.08 (0.04-0.12) h, respectively, for a typical healthy male. Matching on other covariates, a 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was estimated for females relative to males, and for subjects with RA relative to healthy volunteers, respectively. Subjects with RA with mild or moderate renal impairment were estimated to have 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib AUC, respectively, compared with subjects with RA with normal renal function. Upadacitinib clearance was not correlated with body weight., CONCLUSIONS: Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics follow dose-proportional, bi-exponential disposition. A slightly lower upadacitinib clearance is estimated in subjects with RA than in healthy volunteers, consistent with observations for other JAK inhibitors.

Alpha9 integrin is expressed by synovial tissue lining cells and has been identified as a putative key molecule in the development and exacerbation of RA (Kanayama et al. 2009). ASP5094 is a recombinant humanized anti-human alpha9 integrin IgG1 monoclonal antibody under development for the treatment of RA. A first-in-human study in healthy subjects has demonstrated that single intravenous (IV) ASP5094 doses up to 10 mg/kg had an acceptable safety profile and were well tolerated. The purpose of this study was to establish the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of ASP5094 in patients with RA on methotrexate (MTX). Method(s): Patients (aged 18-65 years) with RA on a stable regimen (10-25 mg/week) of MTX were eligible for this phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending-dose study. Eligible patients were assigned to one of three sequential cohorts to receive increasing IV doses of ASP5094 (1, 3, 10 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for a total of three doses (Day 1, 29, and 57). A total of 10 patients were assigned to each cohort and randomized 4:1 (ASP5094, n=8; placebo, n=2). The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of ASP5094 in patients with RA on MTX. Exploratory objectives included the pharmacodynamics of ASP5094, assessed by the alpha9 integrin receptor occupancy rate in neutrophils as a surrogate for alpha9 integrin binding in joints at the level of synoviocytes. Formation of anti-ASP5094 antibodies was assayed using a validated method. Result(s): At all dose levels, ASP5094 was well tolerated. No difference was observed between treatment groups in either the nature or frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or TEAEs considered related to ASP5094, and no dose-response relationship was observed. Two patients permanently discontinued the study due to possible treatmentrelated AEs: one patient treated with ASP5094 (1 mg/kg) discontinued due to a mild, intermittent tremor. The other patient, treated with placebo, discontinued due to a mild second-degree atrioventricular block, which resolved the same day. Pharmacokinetic steady state was not reached after three administrations of ASP5094 (regardless of dose level) because of slow elimination. ASP5094 exhibited nonlinear, target-mediated drug disposition pharmacokinetics. A trend of dose-dependent increase in receptor occupancy was observed. Median receptor occupancy was >90% for all ASP5094 doses on Day 1 and was maintained at >80% for approximately 2 weeks after each dose within 1 mg/kg dose cohort. For doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, median receptor occupancy was maintained by >80% throughout the treatment period until Day 85 and Day 141, respectively. No patient had confirmed positive titers for anti-ASP5094 antibodies. Conclusion(s): In this study, multiple IV doses of ASP5094 had an acceptable safety profile and were well tolerated in patients with RA on stable doses of MTX. ASP5094 exhibited a nonlinear PK disposition and demonstrated dosedependent, high, and prolonged neutrophil alpha9 integrin receptor occupancy rates."

Herein, we report the long term results up to Week (wk) 52 of the same study. In this study (NCT00928512), RA patients (>=18 years; n = 237) with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to receive monthly s.c injections of secukinumab 25, 75, 150, 300 or placebo. After wk16, secukinumab responders remained on the same dose, while doses were escalated in non-responders at wk20 (except in patients initially on 300 mg). All placebo patients were switched to secukinumab 150 mg. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving ACR20 at wk16 followed through wk52. Demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable across all groups. ACR20 responders at wk16 were higher (but not statistically significant) with secukinumab 75 mg (47%), 150 mg (47%) and 300 mg (54%) versus placebo (36%) and maintained their ACR responses through wk52 [75 mg (57%), 150 mg (90%), 300 mg (71%)]. ACR50/70 responses at wk24 and wk52 were highest in patients who remained on secukinumab 150 mg (ACR50/70: wk24 = 50/20%, wk52 = 55/40%), as did responders who switched from placebo to secukinumab 150 mg (ACR50/70: wk24 = 39/6%, wk52 = 50/22%). In secukinumab responders, DAS28- CRP reductions were sustained up to wk52 along with improved HAQ scores (wk24 = 0.6, wk52 = 0.8). Nonresponders did not gain much additional efficacy after dose escalation as assessed by ACR20/50/70 and DAS28- CRP. The overall rates of AEs from wk20~C60 were comparable to those observed up to wk20 (60-70%). Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to study discontinuation. From wk20-60, infection rate was 31.9% with six infections reported as SAEs. In total, 28 SAEs were reported in 21 patients. There were 3 malignancies reported and no deaths. RA patients on secukinumab who achieved an ACR20 response at week 16 maintained their response and demonstrated a reduction in disease activity over time. There were no safety signals with secukinumab related to specific organ class and the frequency of AEs remained stable over time."

Results showed that baricitinib significantly increased LDL-C levels, the net mean change was 13.15 mg/dl with 95% CI 8.89~17.42 (I2 = 0) and the net LSM was 11.94 mg/dl with 95% CI 7.52~16.37 (I2 = 84%). HDL-C also increased obviously with the net LSM change was 7.19 mg/dl (95% CI, 6.05~8.33, I2 = 47%) and net mean change was 5.40 mg/dl (95% CI, 3.07~7.74, I2 = 10%). Subgroup and meta-regression analysis demonstrated baricitinib induced LDL-C and HDL-C increases in a dose-response manner. However, both the pooled RRs of MACEs and differences of cardiovascular risk scores were not statistically significant across groups., CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that baricitinib induced a stable dose-response increase in LDL-C and HDL-C levels. Since the causality association between altered lipids and cardiovascular risk was not identified yet, this issue cannot be completely dismissed. Future research is needed to fully dissect the implications of these lipid changes."

Patients/treatment: patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite methotrexate were randomized (3: 1) to toreforant 30¬†mg/day (weeks¬†0‚Äì52) or placebo (weeks¬†0‚Äì12) followed by toreforant 30¬†mg/day (weeks¬†12‚Äì52). Methods: primary biomarker analyses comprised 39 different proteins/mRNA transcripts measured in synovial biopsy (n = 39) and/or time-matched serum (n = 15) samples collected at baseline and week¬†6. Clinical response was assessed using C-reactive protein-based 28-joint disease activity scores. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: among 21 randomized, treated patients (toreforant-16, placebo-5), 18 (toreforant-13, placebo-5) completed the 12-week double-blind period (none completed open-label treatment) prior to the early study termination. Biomarker profiling indicated potential modest effects of toreforant on gene expression of histamine-1-receptor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-8 in synovium. Potential trends between biomarkers and clinical response were observed with synovial monocyte chemoattractant protein-4 and phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinases and serum matrix metalloproteinase-3. Minimal synovial gene expression of interleukins-17A and 17F was detected. Conclusions: while clear biomarker signals associated with toreforant pharmacology in RA patients were not identified, modest associations between biomarkers and clinical response were noted. Synovial expression of interleukins-17A/17F was minimal. Limited sample size warrants cautious interpretation"

Pts completing the 6-month DB period entered the LTE to receive ~10 mg/kg ABA + background DMARDs. Pts left the study after 5 years of treatment or when ABA became commercially available in their country. Safety was assessed for pts who received = 1 ABA dose during the LTE up to ~5 years. DAS28[CRP]), HAQ-DI and SF-36 scores were assessed for pts randomized to ABA who entered the LTE. DAS28(CRP) data are presented up to Year 4.5 and HAQ-DI and SF-36 data up to Year 4.Results: 317/322 completers of the DB period entered the LTE (218/317 had been randomized to DB ABA). ABA-treated pts who entered the LTE had a mean DAS28(CRP) of 6.5 and a mean HAQ-DI of 1.8 at baseline. Mean exposure (range) to ABA was 42.2 (3.7-65.5) months in the DB period and LTE combined. During the LTE, 69/317 (21.8%) and 36/317 (11.4%) pts discontinued due to lack of efficacy and adverse events (AEs), respectively. Incidence rates (per 100 patient-years [pt-yrs]) of serious AEs and serious infections were 26.0 and 5.3 versus 19.6 and 3.4 in the DB period versus the LTE, respectively. No cases of TB or opportunistic infections occurred in the LTE. Rates of malignancies and autoimmune events per 100 pt-yrs, respectively, were 3.5 and 1.8 in the DB period versus 2.2 and 1.5 in the LTE. Five deaths (respiratory distress, asphyxia, staphylococcal wound infection, metastatic neoplasm, natural cause) occurred in the LTE. Reductions in DAS28 were observed through the LTE: mean changes (95% CI) from baseline were-2.0 (-2.2,-1.8) at Month 6 versus-2.9 (-3.1,-2.6) at Year 4.5. Reductions in HAQ-DI were maintained from Month 6 through the LTE:-0.5 (-0.6,-0.4) at Month 6 and-0.6 (-0.7,-0.5) at Year 4. Improvements from baseline in PCS and MCS were maintained during the LTE, with 7.5 (6.1, 8.8) and 5.8 (4.2, 7.5) at Month 6 versus 8.7 (6.9, 10.5) and 5.4 (3.2, 7.6) at Year 4, respectively.Conclusion: During the ATTAIN LTE, ABA was well tolerated with consistent safety relative to the DB period. Improvements in disease activity, physical function and HRQoL observed in the DB period were sustained in the LTE, supporting long-term use of ABA in anti-TNF inadequate responders."
9738367,,10.3899/jrheum.190494,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of comparing the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) consensus treatment plans (CTPs) in treating new-onset, moderate juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) using the CARRA registry, and to establish appropriate analytic methods to control for confounding by indication and missing data. METHOD(S): A pilot cohort of 39 JDM patients from the CARRA registry was studied. Patients were assigned by the treating physician, considering patient/family preferences, to one of three CTPs: methotrexate and prednisone (MP), intravenous methylprednisolone, methotrexate and prednisone (MMP) or intravenous methylprednisolone, methotrexate, prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin (MMPI) .The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving moderate improvement at 6 months under each CTP. Statistical methods including multiple imputation and inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to handle missing data and confounding by indication. RESULT(S): Patients received MP (n=13), MMP (n=18) and MMPI (n=8). Patients in all CTPs had significant improvement in disease activity. Of the 36 patients who remained in the pilot study at 6 months, 16 (44%) of them successfully achieved moderate improvement at 6 months (6/13, 46% for MP; 7/15, 47% for MMP; 3/8, 38% for MMPI).After correcting for confounding there were no statistically significant pairwise differences between the CTPs (p = 0.328-0.88). CONCLUSION(S): We gained valuable experience and insight from the pilot study to guide the design and analysis of comparative effectiveness studies using the CARRA registry CTP approach. Our analytical methods can be adopted for future comparative effectiveness studies and applied to other rare disease observational studies."

Patients were female with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, aged >=55 years, and had no history of rheumatoid arthritis or corticosteroid use. Outcomes included percentage changes in lumbar-spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD) from baseline to 24 weeks, safety in matched-pair patients, and long-term percentage changes in LS-BMD and fragility fracture incidence in the matched fracture prevention trial (FPT) population. The determination of the acceptability of bridging results was based on the International Conference on Harmonization E5 guidelines., Results: A total number of 228 patients from each study were matched and paired. Patients were similar at baseline (P-values >0.33) except for ethnicity (98% Caucasian for FPT). For changes in LS-BMD from baseline to week 24, treatment with teriparatide showed significantly greater increases (P-values <0.001; least-squares mean difference: 5.0% in the Chinese study and 5.4% in FPT) than comparator (calcitonin/placebo). The safety profiles over 24 weeks were similar between two studies. For matched-pair FPT patients, long-term changes in LS-BMD were significantly greater (least-squares mean difference: 11.5%, P<0.001) and the fragility fracture rate was marginally lower in the teriparatide group compared with the placebo group (13.1% vs 22.3%, P=0.070)., Conclusion: Assuming similar pharmacokinetic profiles for teriparatide between populations, comparable increases in LS-BMD and consistent safety profiles within 24 weeks of the treatment suggest long-term LS-BMD results from the FPT may be applicable to Chinese population."

This study is aimed to investigate the effects of balneotherapy and aquatherapy in the treatment of RA patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 59 patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for RA were included this study. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups. Group 1 (n=20) received balneotherapy, group 2 (n=20) received an aquatic exercise program and group 3 (n=19) was accepted as control group. These programs were applied five times a week, over three weeks (15 sessions). Patients were evaluated for clinical and laboratory parameters. Clinical parameters included pain,duration of morning stiffness, number of swollen and tender joints, disease activity score (DAS28), Modified health assessment questionnaire (mHAQ), physician's and patient's global assessment and hand grip strength. Laboratory evaluation included erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The assessment parameters were measured before, at the end of and after 3 months of the therapy. Results: The mean age of the patients was 54+10.7 (25-75) years and the mean disease duration was 122.3+98.1 (1-424) months. In aquatic exercise group we observed an improvement in DAS28 scores (p<0.001), in the number of tender joints (p<0.005), in VAS scores (p<0.005), mHAQ (p<0.05), physician's and patient's global assessments (p<0.05). Also there was a statistically significant decrease in ESR results in aquatherapy group compared to other groups (p<0.05). However no statistically significant difference was obtained between three groups (p>0.05). Conclusion: This study shows that aquatic exercise program is beneficial in the management of DAS28, pain, HAQ parameters and should be taken in to consideration in planning exercise therapy for RA patients."

One hundred ten patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were using etanercept (ETN) for more than 3 months and still had high or moderate active RA were allocated randomly into two equal groups: one of them treated with 1000 mg/day NCL and the other treated with 1000 mg/day lactose in capsule dosage form. The study duration was 8 weeks. Clinical efficacy of the NCL was measured depending on scoring of the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28), simple disease activity index (SDAI), clinical disease activity index (CDAI), and Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at the baseline and at the end of the 8-week treatment period. Moreover, blood sample were taken from the patients at baseline and at after 8 weeks of treatment for measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 1beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin. At the end of the clinical study, patients had good response to NCL when added to the ETN with a high significant improvement in the SJC, TJC, DAS-28, CDAI, SDAI, and HAQ-DI compared to patients who were received placebo drug. In addition to that, 33% of patients achieved an ACR 20% response (ACR20) on NCL and ETN. Of these, 4% achieved ACR50 and another 4% achieved ACR70 response. While those group treated by placebo + ETN, 5% achieved ACR20 response and no one reached to ACR50 or ACR70 response. Twenty-seven percent of RA patients who have taken the NCL achieved moderate EULAR score while only 17% from the group that taken placebo with ETN achieved moderate response. On the other hand, no significant reduction was found in CRP, ESR, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, while IL-1 beta reduced significantly after treatment with NCL. Treatment with NCL also exerts a significant lowering in the serum level of the E-selectin, ICAM1, and VCAM1 when compared to their value in baseline level. In RA disease, the use of NCL as adjuvant with ETN has resulted in a marked reduction in clinical assessment scoring indices and significantly decreased the E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 with marked improvement in the quality of life of patients.Copyright ¬© 2018, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR)."

Its reliability applied to metatarsophalangeal (MTP 1-5) joints is unknown and was studied in early arthritis and clinically suspect arthralgia., METHODS: Patients underwent 1.5 Tesla MRI of MTP, metacarpophalangeal (MCP 2-5), and wrist joints. Two paired readers scored bone marrow edema (BME), synovitis, tenosynovitis, and erosions. Interreader reliability was assessed of 441 consecutive early arthritis patients at baseline, 215 by 2 readers, and the remaining 226 by 2 different readers. Two readers scored baseline MRI of 82 consecutive patients with clinically suspect arthralgia, and 40 randomly selected patients by 9 readers. Intrareader reliability was determined on a random set of 15 early arthritis patients, scored twice by 2 readers. For change scores, 30 early arthritis patients with baseline and 1-year followup MRI were scored by 2 readers. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Bland-Altman (BA) plots, and smallest detectable change (SDC) were determined. MRI data of MTP joints were compared to wrist and MCP joints., RESULTS: Interreader ICC and mean scores in early arthritis were BME ICC 0.91-0.92 (mean 1.5 +/- SD 2.6), synovitis 0.90-0.92 (1.3 +/- 1.7), tenosynovitis 0.80-0.85 (1.1 +/- 1.8), and erosions 0.88- 0.89 (0.7 +/- 1.0). In patients with clinically suspect arthralgia, ICC were comparable. Intrareader ICC for inflammatory MRI features were 0.84-0.98, for erosions 0.71 (reader 1), and 0.92 (reader 2). Change score ICC were >= 0.90, except erosions (0.77). SDC were <= 1.0. BA plots showed no systematic bias. Reliability scores of MTP joints were similar to MCP and wrist joints., CONCLUSION: Status and change MRI scores of BME, synovitis, tenosynovitis, and erosions of MTP joints can be assessed reliably by RAMRIS."

Methods Focus groups were used to identify key attributes of potential preventive treatment for RA (reduction in risk of RA, how treatment is taken, chance of side effects, certainty in estimates, health care providers opinion). A web-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) was administered to people at-risk of developing RA, asking them to first choose their preferred of two hypothetical preventive RA treatments, and then between their preferred treatment and ‚Äòno treatment for now.‚Äô DCE data was analyzed using conditional logit regression to estimate the significance and relative importance of attributes in influencing preferences. Results Two-hundred and eighty-eight first-degree relatives (60% female; 66% aged 18‚Äì39 years) completed all tasks in the survey. Fourteen out of fifteen attribute levels significantly influenced preferences for treatments. How treatment is taken (oral vs. infusion Œ≤0.983, p<0.001), increasing reduction in risk of RA (Œ≤0.922, p<0.001), health care professional preference (Œ≤0.900, p<0.001), and avoiding irreversible (Œ≤0.839, p<0.001) or reversible serious side effects (Œ≤0.799, p<0.001) were most influential. Predicted uptake was high for non-biologic drugs (e.g. 84% hydroxycholoroquine), but very low for atorvastatin (8%) and biologics (<6%). Conclusion Decisions to take preventative treatments are complex, and uptake depends on how treatments can compromise on convenience, potential risks and benefits, and recommendations/preferences of health care professionals. This evidence contributes to understanding whether different preventative treatment strategies are likely to be acceptable to target populations"

In addition to a reduction of pain and improved function, serially applied mud baths lead to a reduction in the inflammatory processes, which often underlie degenerative and inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
OBJECTIVE: this study investigated the effects of serial mud baths on parameters of functional health, on pain perception and at the molecular level in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and degenerative alterations, e.g. gonarthritis and/or coxarthritis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: a total of 41 patients with inflammatory rheumatic (33 RA and 8 AS) and 40 patients with degenerative diseases were subdived into 2 groups by computer-assisted randomization. In each group a subgroup received 9 serial mud baths within 21 days in addition to a multimodal physical rehabilitative complex treatment (intervention groups). In the other subgroups only the physical rehabilitative treatment was carried out and no mud baths were administered (control group). The outcome parameters were assessment of the functional capacity and pain perception (HAQ, FFbH, VAS and WOMAC), diesease activity (DAS28 and BASDAI) as well as laboratory markers of inflammatory activity (CRP, BSG, IL-1 beta and IL-10) and the patient assessment.
RESULTS: in the intervention groups after serial mud baths there was a significant improvement in the functional parameters (HAQ and FFbH, both p‚ÄØ<‚Äâ0.01) and a significant reduction in pain strength (VAS, p‚ÄØ<‚Äâ0.01) persisting for 3 months after the end of treatment. A significant reduction in disease activity (RA in DAS28 and AS in BASDAI) could be shown for the intervention groups as well as the control groups, whereby the effect strength was more pronounced in the intervention groups. In patients with gonarthritis and/or coxarthritis a significant improvement in functional limitations (WOMAC, p‚ÄØ<‚Äâ0.01) was only found in the intervention groups. A significant improvement in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta (p‚ÄØ<‚Äâ0.01) was only found in the intervention groups with a simultaneous increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (p‚ÄØ<‚Äâ0.01). The CRP and BSG remained within the normal range and showed no significant changes even after serial mud baths.
CONCLUSION: mud baths applied within the framework of a physical rehabilitative complex treatment brought about an improvement of parameters of functional health for both inflammatory rheumatic and degenerative diseases.

9738487,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/ar3685/fulltext.html,10.1186/ar3685,"Purpose: Maraviroc (MVC) is an antagonist of the human chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and has been approved for use in treatment of patients infected with the CCR5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus, Type-1 (HIV). Presence of a nonfunctional receptor of the CCR-5 gene resulting from a 32-base pair deletion has been associated with a reduced incidence and severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Levels of the CCR-5 receptors ligands, RANTES, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta are also increased in synovial fluid of RA subjects. Maraviroc 300 mg BID was investigated in this study to determine whether CCR-5 antagonism would prove safe and effective in the treatment of RA patients on background methotrexate (MTX). Method: This study was divided into two components: Safety/PK (data not shown) and Proof-of-Concept (POC). The Safety/PK component enrolled 16 subjects and demonstrated that MVC 300 mg BID was well tolerated and there was no drug-drug interaction with MTX. The POC component was a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Subjects with active RA, receiving stable weekly MTX (>= 10 mg and <=25 mg) for at least 12 weeks were eligible for enrollment if they had at least 6 tender and swollen joints and CRP >=7.0 mg/L. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to MVC or placebo treatment for 12 weeks and the primary endpoint was ACR20 response. Subjects on background biologic therapy, other oral DMARDs (except antimalarials) and those homozygous for the CCR5mu32 mutation were excluded from entry. Results: The study was terminated at the time of a planned interim analysis for futility. 110 subjects were enrolled: 77 (MVC 300 mg BID) and 33 (placebo BID) with similar demographic features across both treatment groups. There was no significant difference between MVC and placebo in ACR20 responder rate utilizing the full analysis set (MVC: 27.27% vs. placebo: 18.18%; p value=0.155); ACR50 and ACR70 were not different. Components of the ACR response, including CRP were not changed. MVC was safe and well tolerated with the majority of AEs mild to moderate in nature. The most common all causality AEs in the MVC-treated group were constipation (7.8%), nausea (5.2%), fatigue (5.2%), urinary tract infection (3.9%) and respiratory tract infection (2.9%) compared to placebo. There were no clinically significant findings in vital signs, ECG measurements or clinical laboratories including transaminases. There were no SAEs reported in the treated population. Conclusion: Selective antagonism of CCR-5 using MVC failed to improve the signs and symptoms of RA in subjects with active disease on background MTX. Treatment with MVC was safe and well tolerated in RA subjects over 12 weeks. No impact in transaminases was noted in subjects receiving MVC vs. placebo despite background MTX use in this population."

The safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BI 655064, a novel humanised antagonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody, were investigated in this first-in-human trial., METHODS: Healthy male subjects (n = 72) were randomised 3:1, within each BI 655064 dose group, to single intravenous (IV; 0.2-120 mg) or subcutaneous (SC; 40-120 mg) doses of BI 655064 or placebo. Safety, plasma exposure, CD40 receptor occupancy and CD40L-induced CD54 upregulation were assessed over 12 weeks., RESULTS: Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 43% of subjects (n = 31). Frequency and intensity of AEs were generally similar between BI 655064 and placebo and showed no dose relationship. The most frequent AEs were headache and nasopharyngitis. One mild rash and one local reaction occurred with SC BI 655064; two serious AEs were reported, both judged unrelated to BI 655064. Pharmacokinetic evaluation demonstrated a more than proportional increase in plasma exposure relative to BI 655064 dose, with a terminal half-life between 4 h and 4 days IV and approximately 5 days SC; doses >= 20 mg IV and 120 mg SC showed > 90% CD40 receptor occupancy and inhibition of CD54 upregulation, which lasted 7 days in the 120 mg IV and SC groups., CONCLUSIONS: Single doses up to 120 mg BI 655064 IV and SC were well tolerated and showed a high potential to block the CD40-CD40L pathway, supporting further clinical development of BI 655064 in patients with autoimmune disease., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01510782."

9738512,,10.2165/00044011-200222020-00001,"The anti-xerostomia effects of muscarinic agonists (cholinomimetics) are reviewed. Cevimeline (cevimeline monohydrochloride hemihydrate) is a novel muscarinic agonist that stimulates salivary secretion in animals and humans both with normal salivary gland function and with impaired salivary secretion (xerostomia or oral dryness) as effectively as pilocarpine. Other classic and nonselective muscarinic agonists, such as arecoline, carbachol, muscarine and oxotremorine, as well as acetylcholine, failed to exhibit a sufficient salivation effect even at sublethal doses in animals.Oral administration of cevimeline 30mg to humans induces a moderate and lasting increase in salivary flow, and the effect is maintained for at least 4 to 6 hours, longer than with pilocarpine. Mean increases in salivary flow rates after cevimeline treatment were 2-fold higher than after placebo, and no evidence of tolerance of the pharmacological effect has been observed during prolonged administration for up to 12 months.The clinical efficacy of cevimeline in relieving symptoms of xerostomia, including oral dryness and difficulties in chewing, swallowing and speaking, has been demonstrated by placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trials in the USA and Japan. In these studies, cevimeline 30mg three times daily increased salivary flow and improved the symptoms of xerostomia in a significantly higher percentage of patients compared with placebo. Some patients receiving cevimeline therapy for xerostomia experienced adverse events such as sweating, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting), dizziness and rigors; these effects were related to muscarinic activity and were generally mild and tolerable in comparison with those of pilocarpine.These findings suggest that muscarinic M3 agonists are suitable for the treatment of xerostomia. Cevimeline in particular has a long-lasting salivation effect with fewer adverse events than pilocarpine, and so is expected to be more useful for the treatment of xerostomia in patients with Sjogren's syndrome, reducing symptom severity and improving their quality of life."

Design: A randomised observer-blinded controlled trial and economic evaluation with an initial assessment at randomisation and follow-ups at 12, 24 and 36 months. Setting: Five rheumatology centres in England. The 'symptomatic care' patients were managed predominantly in primary care with regular visits by a rheumatology specialist nurse. The 'aggressive care' patients were managed predominantly in the hospital setting. Participants: Patients with RA for more than 5 years were screened in rheumatology clinics. Interventions: The symptomatic care patients were seen at home every 4 months by a rheumatology specialist nurse and annually by the rheumatologist. The aim of treatment was symptom control. The aggressive care patients were seen at least every 4 months in hospital. Their treatment was altered (following predefined algorithms) with the aim of suppressing both clinical and laboratory evidence of joint inflammation. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measure was the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Others included the patient and physician global assessment, pain, tender and swollen joint counts, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the OSRA (Overall Status in Rheumatoid Arthritis) score. X-rays of the hands and feet were performed at the beginning and end of the study. The EQ-5D was used in the health economic evaluation. Comprehensive costs were also estimated and were combined with measures of outcome to examine between-group differences. Results: A total of 466 patients were recruited; 399 patients completed the 3 years of follow-up. There was a significant deterioration in physical function (HAQ) in both arms. There was no significant difference between the groups for any of the clinical outcome measures except the physician global assessment [adjusted mean difference 3.76 (95% CI 0.03 to 7.52)] and the OSRA disease activity component [adjusted mean difference 0.41 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.71)], both in favour of the aggressive arm. During the trial, second-line drug treatment was changed in 77.1% of the aggressive arm and 59.0% of the symptomatic arm. There were instances when the rheumatologist should have changed treatment but did not do so, usually because of mild disease activity. The symptomatic arm was associated with higher costs and higher quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). There was a net cost of 1517 per QALY gained for the symptomatic arm. Overall, the primary economic analysis and sensitivity analyses of the cost and QALY data indicate that symptomatic treatment is likely to be more cost-effective than aggressive treatment in 58-90% of cases. Conclusions: This trial showed no benefit of aggressive treatment in patients with stable established RA. However, it was difficult to persuade the rheumatologist and/or the patient to change treatment if the evidence of disease activity was minimal. Patients in the symptomatic arm were able to initiate changes of therapy when their symptoms deteriorated, without frequent hospital assessment. Approximately one-third of current clinic attenders with stable RA could be managed in a shared care setting with annual review by a rheumatologist and regular contact with a rheumatologist nurse. Further research is needed into disease progression and the use of biological agents, minimum disease activity level below which disease progression does not occur, cost-effectiveness through shared care modelling, the development of a robust and fail-safe system of primary-care based disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) monitoring, and predicting response to DMARDs. ¬© Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2005.

To perform a Cochrane systematic review of benefit (American College of Rheumatology 50% improvement criteria; ACR50) and safety (adverse events and withdrawals) of golimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OVID Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), and Current Controlled Trials databases for randomized or controlled clinical trials of golimumab compared to placebo or disease-modifying antirheumatic drug in adults with RA. Two authors independently selected appropriate studies and abstracted study characteristics and safety and efficacy data and performed risk-ofbias assessment.We calculated mean differences for continuous measures, and relative risks for categorical measures. Results. Four randomized controlled trials with 1231 golimumab-treated and 483 placebo-treated patients were included. Of these, 436 were treated with golimumab at 50 mg every 4 weeks [a dosage approved by the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)]. At an average of 4-6 months, compared to patients treated with placebo and methotrexate (MTX), patients treated with the FDA-approved dosage of golimumab and MTX were 2.6 times more likely to reach ACR50 (p = 0.005, 95% CI 1.3, 4.9; absolute percentage, 38% vs 15%) and 0.5 times as likely to have overall withdrawals (p = 0.005, 95% CI 0.3, 0.8; absolute percentage, 5% vs 10%). Golimumab-treated patients were significantly more likely than those taking placebo to achieve remission (22% vs 4%; p < 0.00001), and to have improvement in functional ability on the Health Assessment questionnaire [0.2 points lower (p < 0.00001, 95% CI 0.25, 0.15); absolute risk difference, -20% (95% CI -25% to -15%); relative percentage difference, -11% (95% CI-14% to -8.3%)]. The studies were too small and short to be powered sufficiently for safety outcomes, but no substantive statistically significant differences were noted between golimumab and placebo regarding adverse events, serious adverse events, infections, serious infections, lung infections, tuberculosis, cancer, withdrawals due to adverse events, and withdrawals due to inefficacy and deaths. Conclusion. At the approved dosage, in patients with active RA taking background MTX, golimumab is significantly more beneficial than placebo. The short-term safety profile is reasonable. Longterm surveillance studies are needed for safety assessment. The Journal of Rheumatology Copyright  2010. All rights reserved."

As with any new agent, it is important to assess the safety and tolerability of abatacept, and hence an integrated safety analysis of five randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind core abatacept clinical trials was performed. The 2,944 patients enrolled had active RA and were receiving a variety of biologic and non-biologic background disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Overall, 1,955 patients were treated with abatacept during the double-blind periods, and 2,688 during the cumulative double-blind and open-label periods (yielding 4764 patient - years of exposure in total). Overall frequencies of adverse events (AEs; 88.8% vs. 85.1%), serious AEs (SAEs14.0% vs. 12.5%) and malignancies (1.4% vs. 1.1%) were similar in abatacept- versus placebo-treated patients, respectively (regardless of the potential relationship to the study therapy). Discontinuations due to SAEs were 2.8% in the abatacept group vs. 1.6% in the placebo group. The frequency of serious infections was low overall (3.0% vs. 1.9% in abatacept- versus placebo-treated patients, respectively). Acute infusional AEs (9.8% vs. 6.7% in the abatacept versus placebo groups, respectively) were mostly mild-to-moderate in intensity. Safety data through cumulative exposure were consistent with those from the double-blind periods; there was no evidence of an increase in the incidence of serious infections or malignancies with increasing exposure to abatacept. Abatacept was associated with low levels of immunogenicity, with no detectable association between immunogenicity and safety or efficacy. Abatacept treatment did not result in a higher rate of seroconversion for antinuclear or anti-dsDNA antibodies versus placebo, and was associated with a similar frequency of autoimmune events versus placebo (1.4% vs. 1.8%, respectively). Moreover, treatment with abatacept may not markedly impair the response to vaccination in healthy volunteers or RA patients. Overall, these findings suggest that abatacept has acceptable safety and tolerability in patients with RA. Ongoing follow-up will monitor whether these features are maintained over long-term abatacept use. ¬¨¬© Copyright Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2007."
9738520,,10.1007/s10195-012-0199-6,"Introduction: Total hip arthroplasty is one of the most frequently used in elective orthopaedic surgery, with minimally invasive methods being more and more frequently described to perform this operation. Unfortunately, to date, the expected benefit (decreased tissue damage) of these minimally invasive techniques has not been objectively measurable. The physiological response to local tissue damage including the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and bone induces a local inflammatory and systemic reaction designed to maintain the immune balance of the organism and stimulate the repair process. We prospectively analysed the inflammatory response after total hip arthroplasty was performed using 2 different approaches: posterolateral and anterior minimally invasive (AMIS). Objectives: The goal of this study was to measure and compare the systemic inflammatory response of patients who were operated on using 2 different techniques, the anterior minimally invasive and the posterolateral. Cytokine levels were used as markers of inflammatory response with the hypothesis that the anterior minimally invasive approach should produce lower levels of circulating cytokines when compared with the posterolateral approach, based on lower local tissue trauma. The secondary objective was to evaluate the functional recovery of patients at 1 year after surgery. Methods: Having obtained the permission of the ethics committee and patient consent - any patient who met the required standard for hip replacement, who had not had prior hip surgery, who had made use only of anti-prostaglandin or opiates such as anti-inflammatory painkillers in the last 15 days prior to surgery, was considered for enrollment. Patients who had not suspended the anti-inflammatory therapy with steroid drugs or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in at least 15 days, had cardiovascular disease requiring pre-operative treatment, had immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, required an arthroplasty to treat a fracture, had had prior hip surgery, a clinical history of infection or current infection at the time of intervention or who required cemented prosthetic components, were excluded. The enrollment to one group or the other was perfomed in a pseudo-randomised way. In order to obtain two homogenous groups of patients, preoperative data such as age, sex, comorbidities, and medications such as antiplatelet-anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory, BMI, ASA was collected. Also collected was perioperative data such as duration of surgery, bleeding, transfusions performed, length of the incision, type of anaesthesia, details of the prosthesis, intraoperative complications, VAS of pain, length of hospitalisation. Tests were performed on the levels of cytokines (IL6, IL10, IL8, TNF alfa) on plasma from venous blood sampling 1 hour before and 1 hour after the intervention, and subsequently 24 hours and 3 days after surgery, for example serum creatine kinase (CK) and C-reactive protein (CRP). By measuring the levels of these markers before and after surgery, we could compare the increment reported between the two different groups of patients. Rating the function through the WOMAC score: pre-op, 4 weeks, 1 year. Evaluation of the patient's ability to forget about the hip replacement through Joint Forgotten Score: 4 weeks, 1 year. Also, radiographic evaluation of the pelvis: immediate post-op, 4 weeks, 1 year. Results: Preliminary results of the study are presented. The post-operative levels of IL6 are encouraging for the AMIS group, in combination with a rapid functional recovery. Conclusions: The results of our work seem to indicate that invasiveness can be measured according to the systemic inflammatory response resulting after local tissue damage. In agreement with other authors, the correct enrollment of patients is mandatory, especially with regard to the use of an anti-inflammatory steroid and COX2 that alter the systemic inflammatory response."

cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is responsible for elevated production of prostaglandins
in inflamed joint tissues and is involved in the mediation of pain. In contrast,
COX-1 is a constitutively produced isoenzyme that is involved in the synthesis of
eicosanoids that have important homeostatic functions, for example, in the
gastric mucosa and platelets. This new knowledge led to the development of drugs
that are highly specific inhibitors of COX-2 while not inhibiting COX-1 at
maximally efficacious dosages. The first COX-2 specific agent approved for
clinical use in the United States was celecoxib. Large multicenter trials have
shown that celecoxib at dosages of 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID is as effective as
naproxen 500 mg BID in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. Another
large multicenter trial also demonstrated that celecoxib 200 mg BTD and 400 mg
BID is as effective as naproxen 500 mg BID in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
(RA). A comparative trial showed that celecoxib 200 mg BID is as effective as
diclofenac SR 75 mg BID in patients with RA. The potential of COX-2 specific
inhibitors to provide antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy equivalent to that
of conventional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs without the adverse
gastrointestinal mucosal and platelet effects associated with nonspecific COX
inhibitors promises to revolutionize the clinical care of arthritis patients."

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of adults with advanced refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: The effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily) in the treatment of advanced refractory rheumatoid arthritis was assessed in three 24-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trials (two placebocontrolled [n = 229 and n = 214] and one with ciclosporin 2.54mg/kg/day as a comparator [n = 842]).

Overall, 959/1262 (76%) of patients in the main analysis group were female and 1189/1262 (94%) were Caucasian. Results: In the placebo-controlled trials, the American College of Rheumatology 20% responder index rate did not differ significantly between mycophenolate mofetil and placebo (19.7% [29/147] vs 13.0% [9/69] and 15.8% [22/139] vs 10.1% [7/69]; p < 0.05 for both studies). Consequently, the activecomparator trial was stopped prematurely before completion and efficacy analyses were not performed. Treatment-emergent adverse events were experienced by 51.6% (371/719), 73.1% (304/416) and 36.1% (53/147) of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin and placebo, respectively. Hypertension, increased serum creatinine, muscle cramps, hirsutism and hypertrichosis were more than twice as common with ciclosporin as with mycophenolate mofetil. In all three trials, the incidence of serious adverse events with mycophenolate mofetil was 12.1% (compared with 11.3% and 7.5% for ciclosporin and placebo, respectively). Conclusion: Mycophenolate mofetil did not achieve a significant difference from placebo in terms of disease improvement in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis. A descriptive analysis of adverse events suggests mycophenolate mofetil was generally as well tolerated as ciclosporin in this patient population. ¬© 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

To perform a cost effectiveness analysis of cyclosporine (CyA) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. Five randomized controlled parallel group clinical trials were selected for metaanalysis. A fixed effects model was used to calculate the treatment effects among the studies. An incremental economic analysis was performed from both a societal perspective and the perspective of Ontario Ministry of Health (MOH). A placebo comparison and 2 head to head comparisons were performed. The total treatment cost was calculated for a typical patient based on a modified intent to treat approach modelled over a one year period. Results. CyA produced a 25% or greater improvement in tender joint count in 35% of the patients relative to 17% of patients receiving placebo. There was no significant difference in improvement between CyA and azathioprine (Aza) or D-penicillamine (D-Pen). From the perspective of the Ontario MOH, the annual incremental cost of achieving the same level of improvement between CyA and Aza was found to be $1,473, and between CyA and D-Pen, $1,618; the annual incremental cost effectiveness ratio per patient improved of adopting CyA over placebo was $11,547. From a societal perspective, the incremental cost of CyA was $2,886 and $3,731 between Aza and D-Pen, respectively. The annual incremental cost effectiveness ratio against placebo was $20,698. Conclusion. Given budgetary constraints on provincial drug plans, guidelines identifying patients in whom the cost effectiveness of CyA may be expected to be most favorable need to be explored. When CyA is the last option available to alleviate RA, whether it is 'good value for money' depends upon the importance placed on patient improvement by the patients and/or by society, and on the alternative uses of the same scarce resources."

Inhibition of COX-1 is thought to be the main cause of the gastrointestinal unwanted effects of NSAIDs, whilst inhibition of COX-2 results in anti-inflammatory effects. Rofecoxib (Vioxx - MSD) and celecoxib (Celebrex - Searle) have been developed as selective inhibitors of COX-2. Rofecoxib is licensed for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis, but not for rheumatoid arthritis. The manufacturer claims that in clinical studies rofecoxib inhibits COX-2 but not COX-1, has the power of high-dose NSAIDs - diclofenac and ibuprofen and superior GI safety profile compared to conventional NSAIDs. Celecoxib is licensed for symptom relief in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The manufacturer claims that celecoxib has comparable efficacy and superior GI tolerability when compared to diclofenac or naproxen. Here, we review rofecoxib and celecoxib and consider whether they are safer than conventional NSAIDs."

Biological agents aimed at specifically antagonising tumour necrosis factor (TNF) are effective in the treatment of adult rheumatoid arthritis. A recent trial of etanercept, a genetically engineered fusion protein consisting of the Fc domain of human IgG1 and the TNF receptor p75, has demonstrated that this agent is also well tolerated and effective in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Etanercept offers a promising new alternative for patients with JIA who have persistently active arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate. Further studies are needed to clarify whether etanercept is equally effective in the various onset types of JIA (oligoarthritis, polyarthritis and systemic arthritis), whether it can modify disease progression and whether it can be administered safely for long periods of time to children."

This report describes the selection of dose level and frequency of LY2189102 treatment using modeling and simulation of LY2189102 PK/PD relationships. Materials and methods: Data from 106 patients were used in this analysis. A 2-compartment mammillary model with dose-dependent first-order input and bioavailability was fitted to pooled PK data from this study and a previous study conducted in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving LY2189102 intravenously. Bioavailability (F) was coded as F=1/(1+exp(-(FA+FS/Dose))), and the absorption half-life (TKa) was coded as TKa= alpha . F, where FA, FS and alpha were estimated parameters, and Dose is in mg. Concentrations predicted using the individual Bayesian estimates of PK parameters were used as a forcing function in the PK/PD model, which simultaneously fitted fasting glycemia, insulinemia and HbA1c data. In this model, glucose-dependent insulin secretion capacity (ISC) had a zero-order input and LY2189102-concentrationdependent (inhibitory Emax) first-order output. Glycemia and insulinemia were interdependently related through ISC and fixed insulin sensitivity and liver glucose output parameters. HbA1c was governed by an input rate that is dependent on glycemia and unglycated hemoglobin, and a first order output. Simulations of a wide range of doses and administration frequencies, from once weekly to once every 6 weeks, were conducted. Results: Data from 5 patients whose PK profiles indicated presumed development of immunogenicity were excluded. The total clearance (CL), distributional clearance (Q), central volume (Vc), peripheral volume (Vp), FA, FS and alpha were (estimate (%SEM)) 9.45 (4.4%) mL/h, 25.1 (16%) mL/h, 3.06 (7.7%) L, 1.91 (7.7%) L, -0.42 (25%), 0.837 (21.1%) and 217 (10.9%) h, respectively. Inter- individual variability in CL, Vc, Vp and Tka was 44.2%, 51.9%, 69.2%, and 57.9%, respectively. Placebo effect, LY2189102's maximum inhibition of insu lin secretion output (Imax), the concentration at 50% effect (IC50), and insulin secretion loss rate constant were 6.5% (45%), 10.4% (39%), 342 mug/L (277%), and 4.72 mo-1 (37%), respectively. Inter-subject variability in PD parameters was modest. Simulation, conditional on final estimates, showed that while total administered doses saturably determined the magnitude of response, all studied administration schedules were essentially equivalent, probably due to the long half-life of the compound. A dose of 60 mg, administered once every 6 weeks, sustains near maximum glycemic response (-0.9 mM from baseline, -0.55 mM from placebo), while an 18 mg dose sustains 75% of the maximal response. Glycemic response plateaus by 3 months, while the HbA1c response at 6 months was 14% higher than that at 3 months. Conclusion: Dosing (SC) of LY2189102 can be as infrequent as once every 6 weeks, potentially offering a convenient therapeutic alternative for patients with T2DM."
9738545,,10.1007/978-1-4757-2043-3_4,"Inflammation of the synovial membrane in rheumatoid arthritis is mediated by specialized cells necessary for immune response. The most prominent features are the accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes, lymphocytes and leukocytes in the proliferating tissue. Pro-inflammatory and proliferative signals are transmitted to the bone marrow and to the synovial membrane. The result is a monoclonal stimulation of specific cell lines, and synovial proliferation in the inflamed joint. Angiogenesis, synovial hypertrophy, and increased perfusion facilitate the accumulation of inflammatory cells. Components of the autoimmune reaction are described in the international system of classification, the CD-System (cluster of differentiation). Pro-inflammatory signals are mediated by metabolites of arachidonic acid. Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, lipoxines and hydroxy fatty acids, derived from this PUFA, stimulate the formation and the activity of adhesion molecules (integrines), cytokines (gamma-interferon, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor-necrosis factor), chemokines (interleukine-8, macrophage-chemotactic peptide, RANTES and colony -stimulating factors ((CSF, granulocytes / monocytes-CSF, Multi-CSF (= IL-3)). Dietary means to mitigate inflammation comprise reduction of arachidonic acid, and increased intake of eicosapentaenoic acid and antioxidants. In the literature 12 randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind studies, fulfilling GCP-criteria, demonstrate a moderate but consistent improvement of clinical findings and laboratory parameters in patients with RA. A dose-response relationship was established up to an daily dose of 2.6 gram fish oil, equivalent to about 1.6 gram EPA. In these experiments EPA was the omega-3 fatty acid responsible for improvement, with distinct effects on inhibition of cytokines formation (IL-1 to IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF), decreased induction of proinflammatory adhesion molecules (selectines, intercellular adhesions molecule-1 (ICAM-1)), and degrading enzymes (e.g. phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible NO-synthetase). Only one study reports the relevance of the background diet. From this study it became apparent that reduction of dietary arachiclonic acid improves the incorporation and the clinical benefit of EPA."

Methods: The study included 40 patients with RA who had an inadequate response to conventional therapy (identifier: IRCT2014011213739N2). The patients were permitted to continue the conventional therapy excluding NSAIDs. 21 of them were treated orally by M2000 at a dose of 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks and the others did not. Serum samples were collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after treatment and were tested for the serum level of anti-CCP and anti-dsDNA antibodies using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The serum level of RF and C-reactive proteins (CRP) was determined by the immunoturbidimetric assay, respectively. Results: At baseline, all patients in the M2000 treated group and the control group were positive for anti-CCP, RF. moreover, 4 of 21 (19%) in the M2000 treated group and 2 of the 19 (10.5%) patients in the control group were positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies, respectively.

Tumor necrosis factor blocking therapy is effective but there remain concerns about long-term risks. Combining disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is a widely used therapeutic alternative; however, there is uncertainty surrounding the most effective regimen. A popular combination is methotrexate plus sulfasalazine, but each of these DMARDs can also be used in combination with other DMARDs and in triple therapy regimens. However, wide variations in study size, design, steroid usage and approaches to combination therapy have made it difficult to form firm conclusions regarding their efficacy. Generally, combination therapy is well tolerated and associated with no significant increase in the rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy. Methotrexate-sulfasalazine, methotrexate-chloroquine, methotrexate-ciclosporin, methotrexate-leflunomide, methotrexate-intramuscular-gold and methotrexate-doxycycline are effective combination regimens. Triple DMARD therapy is better than various DMARD monotherapy and dual therapy regimens. Methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine may have synergistic anti-inflammatory properties. Clinical trial evidence to support the use of other methotrexate and sulfasalazine combinations is often weak or lacking. Further investigation is required to determine the most effective regimen and approach to combination therapy."

Data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis revealed that dose tapering combined with tight control of disease activity is successful. For psoriasis patients the lowest effective dose of biologics needs to be determined. The objective was to assess whether dose tapering of biologics guided by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) scores in psoriasis patients with controlled disease activity is non-inferior (NI) to usual care.
METHODS/DESIGN: this is a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized, non-inferiority trial with cost- effectiveness analysis. One hundred and twenty patients with stable low disease activity (PASI‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ5 and DLQI‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ5) for at least 6¬†months with a stable use of adalimumab, etanercept or ustekinumab will be randomized 1: 1 to the dose reduction group or usual care. In the dose reduction group, the treatment intervals will be prolonged stepwise, resulting in a 33% and 50% dose reduction, respectively. Disease activity is monitored every three months with PASI and DLQI. In case of flare the treatment is adjusted to the previous effective dose. The primary outcome (PASI) at 12¬†months will be analyzed with ANCOVA in which the baseline PASI will be included as covariate to gain efficiency. The secondary outcomes include number of and time to disease flares, health-related quality of life, serious adverse events, and costs.
DISCUSSION: with this study we want to assess whether disease activity guided dose reduction of biologics can be achieved for psoriasis patients with low stable disease activity, without losing disease control. By using the lowest effective dose of biologics, we expect to minimize side effects and save costs.

Methods: a total of 105 patients with persistently active RA and poor responses to traditional medication were randomly divided into MSCT and control groups. Outcomes were evaluated according to the 28-joint Disease Activity Score and Health Assessment Questionnaire, serological indicators, regulatory T cell (Treg) to T helper 17 (Th17) cell ratio, and inflammatory cytokine levels. Twelve weeks after MSCT, the outcomes of the MSCT group were evaluated according to the European League against Rheumatism response criteria. Patients with a good or moderate response were added to the response group, and those with no response were added to the no-response group. Results: no serious adverse events were reported for either MSCT subgroup (28 in the response group and 24 in the no-response group). The therapeutic effects lasted for 48 weeks without continuous administration. Notably, a transient increase in serum IFN-gamma (>2 pg/ml) levels was observed in the response group, but not in the no-response group. Furthermore, an increase in IL-10 levels and the Treg/Th17 ratio and a reduction in IL-6 levels appeared 2-3 weeks after the transient IFN-gamma increase.

METHOD: this phase III double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled study (NCT01770379) randomized (1: 1: 1) patients to subcutaneous secukinumab 150¬†mg, secukinumab 75¬†mg, or placebo at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then every 4¬†weeks. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 24 was the primary endpoint. Secondary outcomes included the 28-joint Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and ACR50 at week 24. Long-term treatment was planned for 5¬†years.
RESULTS: aCR20 response rates at week 24 for the secukinumab 150¬†mg and 75¬†mg groups were not statistically superior to placebo. None of the secondary endpoints was met for either secukinumab dose. Although not statistically significant, compared with placebo, numerically greater differences in least squares mean changes from baseline in HAQ-DI score and numerically higher ACR50 response rates were observed at week 24 in both secukinumab treatment groups. No new or unexpected adverse events were observed in this study compared with the large secukinumab safety database across psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other RA studies.
CONCLUSIONS: given that other second-line therapies have demonstrated efficacy in RA patients who failed to respond to TNF-Œ± inhibitors, these findings may suggest that interleukin-17A inhibition with secukinumab does not provide additional benefit to these patients. This study further confirms the well-characterized safety profile of secukinumab."

Because A77 1726 has a long half-life (2 weeks), treatment with oral leflunomide is initiated with a loading dose of 100 mg once daily for 3 days and continued with 20 mg once daily. Results of large randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials of up to 24 months' duration have shown that leflunomide is significantly superior to placebo and at least as effective as sulfasalazine in improving primary outcome measures, such as tender joint counts, swollen joint counts and physicians' and patients' global assessment, in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Whereas improvement in all primary outcome measures with leflunomide was similar to or significantly less than that with methotrexate after 12 months, the efficacy of both agents was similar after 24 months. The therapeutic effect of leflunomide appears earlier (at 4 weeks) than that of sulfasalazine or methotrexate, and reduction from baseline values in functional disability was significantly greater with leflunomide than with sulfasalazine, methotrexate or placebo at end-point. Leflunomide was at least as effective as sulfasalazine or methotrexate in delaying the rate of radiological progression of disease. The most common adverse events reported in patients receiving leflunomide in randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were diarrhoea (27%), respiratory infections (21%), nausea (13%), headache (13%), rash (12%), increased serum hepatic aminotransferases (10%), dyspepsia (10%) and alopecia (9%). Leflunomide was as well tolerated as sulfasalazine or methotrexate in clinical trials. Monitoring of serum hepatic enzyme levels is recommended in patients receiving leflunomide. The drug is not recommended in female patients who are or may become pregnant. Drug treatment should be discontinued, and hastened drug elimination procedure should be considered, in male patients wishing to father a child. 16 potential cases of pancytopenia and 9 cases of serious skin reactions have been associated with the use of leflunomide in 76,000 patients to date. Conclusions: Leflunomide is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug which reduces the signs and symptoms of inflammatory arthritis and delays the radiological progression of disease in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The drug appears to be as effective and as well tolerated as sulfasalazine or methotrexate, and represents a suitable alternative to these agents in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Benefits with leflunomide are evident within 4 weeks and efficacy is maintained for durations of up to 24 months."

The most frequent reason for not reaching remission remains the Patient Global Disease Activity (PGA) score; about a third of current patients are in Quasi-Remission (all components of ACR Boolean remission <=1 except PGA). PGA strongly correlates with Pain, Fatigue, Functional limitations and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) may be effective to address the full array of RA patients' symptoms. Our objective is to evaluate the impact of MBSR on depressive symptoms, pain, fatigue, PGA and disease activity in RA patients with controlled clinical inflammation. Method(s): Support was obtained from CIORA for a pilot study. Approval was obtained from the CHUS Ethics committee. RA patients (from a pool of =2000 followed at the CHUS) seen during regular follow up are evaluated for controlled disease (<=2 SJC under stable treatment) and for depressive symptoms (Center for Evaluation Studies-Depression (CES-D) >= 16). Participation to group MBSR (8 weekly sessions plus an additional day session) aiming at improving depressive symptoms is offered. Consenting patients will be randomized to a control (standard care) or MBSR group. Questionnaires (pain, fatigue, function, coping, anxiety, depression), Simple Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and serum and saliva samples will be collected at baseline and at 6 months. Qualitative analysis of hurdles and facilitators of patient participation is planned at the end of the MBSR session. At 6 months, patients in the control group will be offered the MBSR intervention. Follow-up post-MBSR is planned every 6 months up to 24 months. Result(s): About 15% of RA patients with <=2 SJC and stable antirheumatic treatment report a CES-D score >= 16. As expected, the CES-D score correlates with PGA, Pain and Fatigue levels. Recruitment is currently ongoing with a target of 30 patients (15 in each group). Results at 6 months of the first MBSR group and patient feedback on patient recruitment strategies will be available at the time of the annual meeting. Conclusion(s): The need for an intervention to address persistent symptoms in RA patients with controlled inflammatory disease is real, although many patients appear reluctant to participate in a time-consuming intervention aimed primarily at improving depressive symptoms. Pending the results of the qualitative analysis, our experience suggests that putting more emphasis on Pain, Fatigue, Anxiety and Quality of life may be more appealing to patients. This may affect the recruitment strategy for the next MBSR groups."

'Treating to target' has been shown to be effective in active established disease and also in early disease. However, there is a lack of nationally agreed treatment protocols for patients with established rheumatoid arthritis who have intermediate disease activity. This trial is designed to investigate whether intensive management of disease leads to a greater number of remissions at 12 months. Levels of disability and quality of life, and acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be examined., METHODS: The trial is a 12-month, pragmatic, randomised, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre trial undertaken at specialist rheumatology centres across England. Three hundred and ninety-eight patients with established rheumatoid arthritis will be recruited. They will currently have intermediate disease activity (disease activity score for 28 joints assessed using an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 3.2 to 5.1 with at least three active joints) and will be taking at least one disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. Participants will be randomly selected to receive intensive management or standard care. Intensive management will involve monthly clinical reviews with a specialist health practitioner, where drug treatment will be optimised and an individualised treatment support programme delivered based on several principles of motivational interviewing to address identified problem areas, such as pain, fatigue and adherence. Standard care will follow standard local pathways and will be in line with current English guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Patients will be assessed initially and at 6 and 12 months through self-completed questionnaires and clinical evaluation., DISCUSSION: The trial will establish whether the known benefits of intensive treatment strategies in active rheumatoid arthritis are also seen in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis who have moderately active disease. It will evaluate both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials, ID: ISRCTN70160382 . Registered on 16 January 2014."
9738630,,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018540,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) above the baseline risk attributable to traditional CVD risk factors seen in the general population. Exercise in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is designed specifically for high-risk primary prevention and those with established CVD. Even though the European League Against Rheumatism guidelines state that exercise is safe for individuals with RA and exercise can reduce CVD risk, patients with RA rarely participate in CR. Thus, little is known about CR's impact on inflammatory and CVD risk in the RA population. The purpose of this trial is to determine the feasibility of a 12-week CR programme for patients with RA and whether it decreases CVD risk without exacerbating RA., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised controlled trial whereby 60 participants with RA will be recruited and randomly assigned to either standard of care (SOC) treatment or SOC plus a 12-week CR programme (60 min of education plus two 60 min aerobic exercise sessions/week). Exercise will be performed at 60%-80% of heart rate reserve. Outcome measures (Framingham Risk Score, resting heart rate, blood pressure, blood lipids, markers of systemic inflammation (ie, interleukin (IL) 6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Clinical Disease Assessment Index, Disease Activity Score-28, physical activity levels and peak cardiorespiratory fitness) will be assessed preintervention (week-0), postintervention (week-13) and 6 months postintervention., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Nova Scotia Health Authority Research Ethics Board. Results will be submitted for publication in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01534871; Pre-results.

METHODS: Tear and serum samples were collected from 30 healthy volunteers, 30 DE patients with non-Sjogren's syndrome DE (NSSDE) and 30 DE patients with primary SSDE. The eight most frequent symptoms of DE were scored. All patients underwent corneal and conjunctival staining, tear film breakup time (TBUT), and Schirmer I test. The serum and tear levels of IL-33 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of IL-33 expression and its correlation with Th cytokines and disease severity were also analyzed. RESULTS: We found that symptom scores and corneal staining grade were significantly higher in SSDE group compared with NSSDE and control group, whereas the results of TBUT and Schirmer I test were significantly lower in SSDE group compared with NSSDE and control group. The tear levels of IL-33 were significantly increased in tears of SSDE patients compared with those of controls and NSSDE patients (P < 0.05). Moreover, the elevated tear levels of IL-33 were positively correlated with symptom scores but negatively correlated with tear film breakup time and Schirmer I test in both NSSDE and SSDE patients (P < 0.05). The tear levels of IL-33 of both NSSDE and SSDE patients were also positively correlated with tear levels of IL-4 and IL-5 (P < 0.05). Correlation between the serum levels of IL-33 with Th1/17/Treg cytokines was not found. CONCLUSION: Elevated tear levels of IL-33 were associated with the Th2 cytokines and disease severity of DE. Therefore, IL-33 may have important roles in the immunopathogenesis of the DE."

In addition, differences in socio-demographic and clinical characteristics between users and non-users were explored.
METHODS: as part of regular care the care booklet was distributed among RA-patients of two hospitals in the Netherlands. 1000 patients received the care booklet by mail, whereas another 1000 received an information letter with the option to order the care booklet. Four months after distribution, a random sample of 810 patients (stratified by hospital and distribution method) received a questionnaire on the use of the booklet, social-demographic and clinical characteristics. To compare effects between the two distribution strategies and differences between users and non-users univariate and multilevel regression analyses were performed. Secondary analysis included a per-protocol analysis (excluding participants who did not order the care booklet).
RESULTS: one hundred ninety four patients in the 'unsolicited supply' and 176 patients in the 'supply on demand' group (46%) returned the questionnaire. In the 'supply on demand' group 106 (60.2%) participants ordered the care booklet. In total, no difference was found in use between the 'unsolicited supply'-group (23.2%) and the 'supply on demand'-group (21.6%) (OR 0.9 CI: 0.6-1.5). However, the proportion of users among patients in the 'supply on demand'-group who ordered the booklet (35%) was significantly higher than in the 'unsolicited supply'-group (OR 1.9 CI: 1.1-3.2). Regardless of distribution method, use of the care booklet was associated with being married (OR 2.4 CI: 1.2-4.6), higher disease activity (mean difference 0.5 CI: 0.0-1.1), more activity limitations (mean difference 0.2 CI: 0.1-0.4), use of corticosteroids (OR 1.9 CI: 1.0-3.5), perception of disease course as fluctuating (mean difference 1.4 CI: 0.5-2.3) and higher educational needs (mean difference 9.7 CI: 2.9-16.6).
CONCLUSIONS: from an economic and environmental perspective a 'supply on demand'-distribution strategy could be recommended. Results of this study provide starting points to optimize further implementation strategies of a care-booklet in routine care.

9738665,,10.2169/internalmedicine.41.608,"In the past 5 years approximately 500 patients worldwide suffering from severe autoimmune disease (AD) have received an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as treatment following high-dose chemotherapy. The EBMT and EULAR data base contains 370 registrations, the most frequently transplanted ADs being multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Around 70% responded initially well, with durable remission/stabilization seen more frequently in MS and SSc than in RA and SLE, the latter having around 2/3 relapses, the majority of which respond to simple agents. Overall 8% transplant-related mortality was seen with large inter AD differences (12.5% in SSc and only one patient in RA) probably reflecting the degree ot vital organ involvement at the time of transplant. This phase I/II data has led to a running phase III randomized trial in SSc called the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, and it will soon begin in MS (ASTIMS) and RA (ASTIRA). The concept of immunological ""re-setting"" has evolved, and needs to be confirmed by longer follow-up and the multicentre, international phase III randomized studies."
9738667,,10.4066/biomedicalresearch.62-18-412,"Background: Systemic inflammation has been associated with obesity, with elevated levels of triglycerides and reduced levels of HDL-cholesterol. Aim: To determine the frequency of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients suffering of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and to compare the evolution of MetS parameters during DMARD (Disease-Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs) therapy versus combination of DMARDs and biologics. Methods: The study was conducted on 277 RA patients, 115 AS patients and 103 PsA patients. Patients with inflammatory rheumatisms and MetS were randomized into two groups per disease (RA, AS and PsA). Group 1 underwent DMARD therapy. Group 2 followed a combination of DMARDs and biologics. Patients were assessed for the inflammatory status (C-reactive protein) and MetS (triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and blood pressure) initially, after 1 y and after 2 y. Results: 88 RA patients (31.7%), 16 AS patients (14%) and 35 PsA patients (34%) met the criteria for MetS. RA, AS and PsA patients with MetS who followed a combination of DMARDs and biologic therapy had significant improvement of triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol compared to patients who followed only DMARDs both at 1-y and 2-y assessments. There were no differences of the blood pressure in the two groups. Conclusion: The frequency of MetS was higher in RA and AS patients than in PsA patients. Biologic therapy could influence the evolution of MetS in patients suffering of autoimmune inflammatory rheumatisms.

One plausible mechanism for this TP-DI is through the pharmacodynamic effect of MTX on immunogenicity. However, there is no definitive evidence to substantiate this mechanism, and other competing hypotheses, such as MTX suppressing FcgammaRI expression thereby affecting mAb PK, have also been proposed. In order to understand this mechanism, a cynomolgus monkey study was conducted using golimumab as a model compound. Golimumab elicited high incidences of immunogenicity in healthy cynomolgus monkeys. Concomitant dosing of MTX delayed the onset and reduced the magnitude of anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation. The impact of MTX on golimumab PK correlated with the ADA status. Prior to ADA formation, MTX has no discernable effect on golimumab PK. Additionally, no alteration in FcgammaRI expression was observed following MTX treatment. The impact of MTX on golimumab immunogenicity and PK has been observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis. In a representative phase 3 study of golimumab in patients with PsA, patients not receiving concomitant MTX was reported to have ~30% lower steady-state trough golimumab levels compared to those who received MTX. However, further analysis showed that PsA patients who were negative for ADA in both treatment groups had comparable trough levels of golimumab. Taken together, our results suggest that the mechanism of TP-DI between MTX and golimumab can mostly be attributed to the pharmacodynamic effect of MTX, i.e., the lowering of immunogenicity and immunogenicity-mediated clearance of mAbs."

Dkk-1 and sclerostin are the main inhibitors of the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway and play a key role in the regulation of both bone formation and resorption. We performed this study in order to compare the serum levels of the WNT-pathway regulators along with bone turnover markers (BTM) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) between three different groups: one group of female patients affected by PsA, one group of female patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and healthy female controls (HC). This is a cross-sectional study including 33 patients with PsA classified with the CASPAR criteria, 35 HC, and 28 patients with RA classified with the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria. Intact N-propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), Dickkopf-related-protein 1 (Dkk-1), sclerostin, PTH, and 25OH-vitamin D serum levels were dosed. The PsA group showed significantly lower Dkk-1 levels when compared to the HC and RA groups. Dkk-1 in the RA group was significantly higher than HC. A similar trend was documented for PTH. In the PsA group, CTX-I was found to be lower than in both the RA and HC groups. This study demonstrated for the first time that Dkk-1 levels in PsA are lower than HC, in contrast with RA, in which they are increased. These results might contribute to explain the different bone involvement of the two different diseases."

Aim of the study is to assess the relationship between Femoral Neck Anteversion (FNA), LBP, and spinopelvic parameters in patients undergoing Total Hip Replacement (THR) for unilateral severe primary HOA., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 91 patients were recruited. Inclusion criteria were: grade 5 or 6 unilateral HOA, according to Turmezei, and Harris Hip score (HHS) <60. Exclusion criteria were: secondary hip osteoarthritis (dysplasia of the hip, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis); previous surgery of the spine, hip or knee; scoliosis with a Cobb angle greater than 10degree; spondylolisthesis; history of spine fractures; previous bone tuberculosis or any spine infections; any contraindications to CT; BMI >30. Patients were divided into two homogeneous Groups according to the presence (Group-A) or not of concomitant LBP (Group-B). All patients underwent preoperatively a hip CT scan to evaluate FNA, Acetabular Anteversion (AA), and Combined Anteversion (CA = FNA + AA). DELTAFNA, DELTAAA and DELTACA were calculated as the differences between the arthritic hip and the normal hip angles in each Group. Full spinal X-rays in upstanding position were performed before (baseline) and 6 months after THR (follow-up) to calculate spinopelvic parameters. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated at baseline and at follow-up using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), HHS, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RM), and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The intra-group and inter-group variability were assessed using, respectively, paired and unpaired t tests. At baseline, the association between HRQoL scores and DELTAFNA, DELTAAA, and DELTACA was analysed by the Pearson correlation test., RESULTS: At baseline, in Group-A, there was a significant difference between arthritic FNA and normal hip FNA, while no differences were found in AA between the two hips. A close correlation was observed between DELTAFNA and Spine-VAS (r = 0.788), ODI (r = 0.824), and RM (r = 0.775). In Group-B, there was not a significant difference in FNA and AA between the two hips. At recruitment, in Group-A patients, we recorded a higher LL, SS, PI, SVA(C7), and a lower PT and T1-SPI compared with Group-B subjects. Six months after THR, in Group-A, an improvement of all clinical scores was recorded, as well as, a significant reduction of SS, LL, T1PA, and SVA(C7) and an increment of PT. In Group-B, at follow-up, an improvement of HHS, Hip-VAS, and SF-36 was recorded, while the changes in spinopelvic parameters were not significant., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with concomitant unilateral HOA and LBP showed a marked anteverted FNA in the arthritic hip and a spinopelvic misalignment. After THR, a relief of both hip and low back pain and a change in spinopelvic parameters is observed."

Under the elevated extra-neural pressure, free nerve endings release neuropeptides, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and substance P, thus promoting neurogenic inflammation. Objective: this study aimed to assess the effect of therapeutic neural mobilization (NM) exercises targeting the nervous system on disease impact in RA patients. Methods: a total of 21 RA patients were randomized into NM (n= 11) and control (n= 10) groups. NM group patients performed NM exercises targeting the median, musculocutaneous, femoral, and saphenous nerve, as well as the entire nervous system twice daily for 4-8 weeks. Control RA patients performed gentle joint mobilization exercises targeting the same joints. Primary outcome was the change in pre-/post-treatment score in the validated Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID). Secondary outcome was erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Results: there were no significant differences between the groups at baseline. No adverse events were observed and compliance was over 90%. Post-treatment, favorable changes were observed in the NM group RAID score: -5.1 vs. -0.8; weighted RAID score: -0.79 vs. -0.15. ESR was reduced in the NM group, albeit non-significantly. Regarding the RAID score domains, the NM group demonstrated significant improvements in pain and coping. Conclusion: the current data indicate a beneficial effect of NM exercises on pain and self-efficacy in our RA patients. Larger clinical studies are warranted to determine the clinical effectiveness of NM as a treatment for pain for RA patients and simultaneously address immune and neuropeptide modulation through NM.

9738685,,10.3892/etm.2018.6495,"The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional synthetic or biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). A total of 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The primary effective outcome was the RA improvement to reach an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response rate. The safety outcomes were composed of clinical laboratory parameters. All patients included received 4 mg baricitinib once daily to treat RA for 12 or 24 weeks. The ACR20 response rate in the baricitinib group was significantly higher compared with that in the control group at 12 weeks [relative risk (RR), 1.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.62-1.94; P<0.00001] and 24 weeks (RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.48-2.10; P<0.00001). Similarly, other effective outcome measures also exhibited significant improvements in the baricitinib group compared with those in the placebo group. Regarding the safety outcomes, no significant difference in adverse events (AEs) was identified at 12 weeks (P=0.14), but AEs were significantly higher in the baricitinib group compared with those in the control group at 24 weeks (P=0.03). Most laboratory values were significantly different between the baricitinib and placebo groups; however, the clinical significance of these changes remains to be determined. In summary, the present meta-analysis demonstrated that 4 mg baricitinib once daily was beneficial in patients with active RA with an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional synthetic or biological DMARDs. More high-quality RCTs are required to determine the sustained efficacy and the safety of baricitinib. Copyright ¬© 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved"

The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the quality of life (QoL) in patients after receiving, tapering, or stopping bDMARD treatment. Three hundred and thirty patients with RA and 120 patients with AS were enrolled. Data on the patients receiving bDMARDs were obtained by self-completed questionnaires including the short-form 36 (SF-36) and Global Quality of Life (GQL) scale. A relapse was defined as the QoL becoming worse than that before bDMARD treatment. Significant improvement in all domains of the SF-36 and GQL was noted in the patients after receiving bDMARDs. Improvement in SF-36 was significantly greater in RA patients with a shorter disease duration (< 6 years) and milder patient-assessed disease activity and in AS patients with a shorter disease duration and younger age. There were significant decreases in all domains of the SF-36 and GQL in both groups after reducing/discontinuing bDMARD treatment. The patients in both groups with a shorter period of bDMARD treatment (<= 3 years) had significantly worse SF-36 scores compared to those with a longer period of bDMARD treatment (> 3 years). The relapse rate after reducing/discontinuing treatment was over 90.0% in the RA patients and over 50.0% in the AS patients within 12 months. bDMARDs significantly improved the QoL of the patients with RA and AS. However, interrupting or stopping the treatment protocol worsened the QoL and led to relapses, especially in the patients who used bDMARDs for a shorter period."

Proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1beta and TNFa play a crucial role in induction and maintenance of synovitis, pannus formation and bone and cartilage destruction. Within a few years, these morphological changes may lead to joint destruction and consecutively to functional impairment. Since April 2002 a recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra) is available in Germany for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Anakinra (Kineret) is approved for therapy in combination with methotrexate and should be applied according to guidelines established by the German Rheumatology Society for the use of biologicals in treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The approval of anakinra as a new therapeutic is based on data obtained in large multicenter, placebo-controlled, and randomised trials in comparison to placebo. Treatment of Anakinra as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate lead to significant improvement of signs and symptoms of disease as measured by the ACR 20 (or more) response and was associated with a slower radiographic progression with regard to joint space narrowing and development of erosions. Anakinra showed a favourable safety profile with injection side reactions as the predominant side effect that occurs in 70% of patients usually after 10-12 days of treatment and that are mostly mild to moderate and self-limiting. Patients with previous pneumonia or other risk factors for pulmonary infections such as chronic obstructive lung disease seem to show a slightly increased risk of developing infectious complications of the bronchopulmonary system while being on anakinra and should be monitored appropriately. Combining IL-1ra treatment with the use of anti-TNF agents showed an increased risk of infectious complications in clinical studies and is not recommended at present. Studies are currently assessing the use of anakinra for treatment of other rheumatic diseases like psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis or spondylarthropathy."

Group 1 (n = 60) aimed to achieve SDAI <= 3.3 and Group 2 (n = 60), DAS28 < 2.6. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) were measured at baseline and 12 months. A posthoc analysis was also performed to ascertain whether achieving sustained remission could prevent progression in arterial stiffness., RESULTS: The proportions of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy were significantly lower in Group 1 throughout the study period. At 12 months, the proportions of patients achieving DAS28 and SDAI remission, and the change in PWV and AIx, were comparable between the 2 groups. In view of the lack of differences between the 2 groups, a posthoc analysis was performed at Month 12, including all 110 patients with PWV, to elucidate the independent predictors associated with the change in PWV. Multivariate analysis revealed that achieving sustained DAS28 remission at months 6, 9, and 12 and a shorter disease duration were independent explanatory variables associated with less progression of PWV., CONCLUSION: With limited access to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, treatment efforts toward DAS28 and SDAI remission had similar effects in preventing the progression of arterial stiffness at 1 year. However, achieving sustained DAS28 remission was associated with a significantly greater improvement in PWV. [Clinical Trial registration: Clinicaltrial.gov NCT01768923.]."

To optimise cost-effectiveness, tapering or interruption of TNFi therapy in established RA patients is advocated. We explored whether cessation of TNFi results in impaired vasodilator function and whether this relates to the development of a Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-based flare. Forty-one patients were assessed for eligibility as RA with at least 12 months of low disease activity (based on 28 joint counts); 35 enrolled into the randomised study: 8 were randomised to continue, 27 to stopping TNFi. Forearm vasodilation to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was assessed before cessation of TNFi therapy (visit 1) and 6 months after (dis)continuation of TNFi or at flare (based on DAS28) whichever came first (visit 2). None of the patients who continued their TNFi therapy flared. Eight out of 22 patients who stopped TNFi therapy flared. The vasodilator response to ACh and SNP was reduced significantly in patients who experienced a flare of RA: In patients who did not experience a flare, the vasodilator response to ACh or SNP was not significantly affected. Vasodilator function is reduced after cessation of TNFi, but only when RA reactivates, indicating that early vasodilator dysfunction is a consequence rather than a cause of systemic inflammation in RA and not specifically related to inhibition of TNFalpha signalling. Without close monitoring, microvascular damage can occur after TNFi interruption with potential devastating implications for cardiovascular health., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02130076."

Statistically significant improvements were found in spa therapy compared to control in disease activity (p = 0.006) and patient (p = 0.020) and physician global (p = 0.011) assessments, and a trend toward improvements in pain (p = 0.069) and swollen joints (p = 0.070) at 6 months. A 2-week spa therapy adjunct to usual pharmacological therapy provided beneficial clinical effects compared to usual pharmacological therapy alone, in RA patients treated with traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. These beneficial effects may last for 6 months."

(EAA) on treating active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)., METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial was performed. All the 159 participates with active RA were randomly assigned to the control group (80 cases) and EAA group (79 cases) using concealed random allocation method. In the control group, patients were medicated with leflflunomide and methotrexate for 48 weeks; and patients in the EAA group were administrated with leflflunomide, methotrexate plus EAA (30 g/d). At the time points of 0, 12, 24 and 48 weeks, the clinical outcome measures, including objective pain score, tenderness score, number of painful joints, number of swollen joints, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) score for quality of life, levels of serum rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated protein antibodies (CCP-Ab), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), visual analogue score for pain (VAS), and the overall effificacy were detected and recorded., RESULTS: The objective pain score, number of painful joints and ESR at 12 weeks, tenderness score and HAQ at 24 weeks, and the tenderness score, number of painfull joints, number of swollen joints, HAQ, CRP, RF and CCP-Ab at 48 weeks were signifificantly improved in the EAA group compared with the control group (P<0.01 or P<0.05). At 24 and 48 weeks, the overall effificacy of the EAA group was signifificantly higher than the control group (P<0.01). There were signifificantly higher withdrawal rate of corticosteroids within 12 weeks post-treatment and lower incidence rate of adverse effects in the EAA group compared with the control group (P<0.01 or P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: EAA plus methotrexate and leflflunomide were more effective and safer than the routine use of methotrexate and leflflunomide in the treatment of active RA."

The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib was demonstrated as induction and maintenance therapy in 3 Phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled studies (OCTAVE Induction 1, NCT01465763; OCTAVE Induction 2, NCT01458951; OCTAVE Sustain, NCT01458574) in patients (pts) with moderate to severe UC. Methods We present interim safety and efficacy data up to 3 years of treatment (as of 8 July 2016) from an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, long-term extension study (OLE; NCT01470612) in pts who had completed or demonstrated treatment failure in OCTAVE Sustain, or who were non-res-ponders after completing OCTAVE Induction 1 or 2. Pts in remission at Week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain received tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID); all others received 10 mg BID. At Month 2, all pts underwent endoscopy, and non-responders from Induction were mandated to withdraw if no evidence of clinical response was shown. Remission was defined by a Mayo score <2 with no individual subscore >1, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Binary efficacy endpoints were derived from Mayo score, based on local-read endoscopic subscore. Results 914 pts (5 mg BID, n = 156 [17.1%]; 10 mg BID, n = 758 [82.9%]) received >1 dose of study drug; 381 pts (41.7%) discontinued. The most frequent AE leading to dis-continuation was worsening of UC. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs by system organ class (both doses) were 'infections/infestations' and 'gastrointestinal disorders', and by preferred term were 'nasopharyngitis' and 'worsening of UC Serious infections AEs were reported in 4 (2.6%) and 14 (1.8%) pts with 5 and 10 mg BID, respectively. Malignancies excl. NMSC were reported in 9 (1.2%) pts in the 10 mg BID group (no clustering of malignancy type); none were reported in the 5 mg BID group. No new safety risks were identified. Data 'as observed' for remission and mucosal healing at Months 2, 12 and 24 are shown. Conclusions In pts with moderate to severe UC who remained in the OLE study, no new safety concerns emerged compared with those observed with tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. Efficacy results from this OLE study support sustained efficacy with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID. Funded by Pfizer Inc. [Figure Presented]."

A multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted between March 2012 and July 2014 at ten Chinese hospitals. In total, 320 pSS patients-classified according to the 2002 American-European Consensus Group Criteria-were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive TGP(600 mg, tid) in the TGP group or placebo for 24 weeks in the placebo group. Study personnel, investigators, and patients were blinded to the treatment grouping. The primary endpoint was the improvement of EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) at week 24. The secondary endpoints were dry eyes/mouth/skin/nose/throat/vagina visual analogue scale (VAS), pain and discomfort VAS, fatigue VAS, mental discomfort VAS, patient global assessment (PGA), EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), Schirmer's test, basal/stimulated salivary flow-rate values, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). All adverse events were recorded during the trial period. ESSPRI improved more in the TGP than the placebo group (p < 0.001). Dry eyes/throat/vagina VAS, fatigue VAS, mental discomfort VAS, PGA, Schirmer's test, and ESR also improved more in the TGP group than in the placebo group (all p < 0.05). Stimulated salivary flow-rate values increased in the TGP group at week 12 but not at week 24. Adverse events in TGP group were 10.9%. TGP can alleviate some dryness symptoms as well as disease activity in pSS patients over 24 weeks. TGP was well tolerated by study subjects. TGP seems to be an effective and safe treatment for pSS.

9738790,,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025333,"INTRODUCTION: Observational studies indicate a potentially causal role for interleukin 6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, in pathogenesis of depression, but interventional studies based on patients with depression have not been conducted. Tocilizumab, anti-inflammatory drug, is a humanised monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-6 signalling and is licensed in the UK for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The main objectives of this study are to test whether IL-6 contributes to the pathogenesis of depression and to examine potential mechanisms by which IL-6 affects mood and cognition. A secondary objective is to compare depressed participants with and without evidence of low-grade systemic inflammation., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a proof-of-concept, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Approximately 50 participants with International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of depression who have evidence of low-grade inflammation, defined as serum high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) level >=3 mg/L, will receive either a single intravenous infusion of tocilizumab or normal saline. Blood samples, behavioural and cognitive measures will be collected at baseline and after infusion around day 7, 14 and 28. The primary outcome is somatic symptoms score around day 14 postinfusion. In addition, approximately, 50 depressed participants without low-grade inflammation (serum hs-CRP level <3 mg/L) will complete the same baseline assessments as the randomised cohort., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the South Central-Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (REC) (Reference: 18/SC/0118). Study findings will be published in peer-review journals. Findings will be also disseminated by conference/departmental presentations and by social and traditional media., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN16942542; Pre-results.

9738796,,10.2196/jmir.9997,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy can aid patients with rheumatoid arthritis with elevated levels of distress to enhance their quality of life. However, implementation is currently lacking and there is little evidence available on the (cost-) effectiveness of different treatment strategies., OBJECTIVE: Cost-benefit ratios are necessary for informing stakeholders and motivating them to implement effective treatment strategies for improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A cost-effectiveness study from a societal perspective was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial on a tailored, therapist-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) intervention for patients with rheumatoid arthritis with elevated levels of distress as an addition to care as usual (CAU)., METHODS: Data were collected at baseline or preintervention, 6 months or postintervention, and every 3 months thereafter during the 1-year follow-up. Effects were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs from a societal perspective, including health care sector costs (health care use, medication, and intervention costs), patient travel costs for health care use, and costs associated with loss of labor., RESULTS: The intervention improved the quality of life compared with only CAU (DELTA QALYs=0.059), but at a higher cost (DELTA=4211). However, this increased cost substantially reduced when medication costs were left out of the equation (DELTA=1863). Of all, 93% (930/1000) of the simulated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were in the north-east quadrant, indicating a high probability that the intervention was effective in improving HRQoL, but at a greater monetary cost for society compared with only CAU., CONCLUSIONS: A tailored and guided ICBT intervention as an addition to CAU for patients with rheumatoid arthritis with elevated levels of distress was effective in improving quality of life. Consequently, implementation of ICBT into standard health care for patients with rheumatoid arthritis is recommended. However, further studies on cost reductions in this population are warranted., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register NTR2100; http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2100 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/724t9pvr2).

While there is a broad agreement that patient educational interventions are valuable, their effectiveness at improving adherence is questionable. Objective(s): This study aimed to assess the impact of different modes of patient education on medication adherence in Thai RA patients. Method(s): One hundred and twenty RA patients with non-adherence, defined as pill count >80% or medication taking behavior questionnaire for Thai patient (MTB) >23, were randomized by block randomization into multi-component intervention group (MG) or single intervention group (SG). The MG received a 30-min directed counseling and a disease information pamphlet. The SG received only a disease information pamphlet. The primary outcomes were improvement in adherence rate measured by pill count and MTB score after 12 weeks. The clinical trial registry number is TCTR20171207003. Result(s): After 12 weeks, pill count adherence rate increased significantly from baseline in both groups (MG; 5.38 +/- 12.90, P = 0.002 vs. SG; 3.81 +/- 14.23, P = 0.044). However, the mean difference of adherence rate between both groups were not significant. MTB score improved in MG (1.12 +/- 2.22, P < 0.001), but not in SG (0.44 +/- 2.92, P = 0.251). Clinical outcome including DAS28, EQ-5D, pain score, and physician glo-bal assessment were unchanged from baseline in both groups. Conclusion(s): Patient education significantly improved adherence. However, there were no differences between single education intervention and multi-component education intervention in improving medication adherence."

No between groups differences in adjunct drug therapy pattern for disease flares were seen. In conclusion, although, non-significant changes in the study variable of DAS28_ESR is in agreement with few previous reports, nevertheless, trends in its reduction in the intervention group along with the significant delayed PtGA score improvements occurred in the intervention group convince us to suggest further investigations on the supplementary olive and fig products, with a longer follow up periods.Copyright ¬© 2016 by School of Pharmacy."

Efficacy and safety were evaluated in 19 patients who completed the study. Both piroxicam and indomethacin were effective (as judged by a reduction in the number of painful joints, articular index, duration of morning stiffness, thermographic index, paracetamol consumption, and by improvement in grip strength and overall condition). Significant differences between the two drugs were all in favour of piroxicam. Adverse effects were few (2 placebo, 5 piroxicam, 7 indomethacin). Slight falls in haemoglobin and slight rises in blood urea were associated with both agents. Patient preference was 11:3 in favour of piroxicam.

However, the response rates and accumulated productivity days of patients receiving subcutaneous anakinra 30 or 75 mg/day for 6 months were similar to those of placebo. With respect to the total Genant radiographic scores, the same study showed that all anakinra treatment regimens snowed disease progression after 6 months to a greater extent than placebo. In double-blind, randomised trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, combined treatment with anakinra and methotrexate was associated with higher ACR 20, 50 and 70 response rates than with methotrexate alone. Anakinra, used alone or in combination with methotrexate, was generally well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse event being a mild injection-site reaction of transient duration. Infections requiring antibacterial therapy or hospitalisation occurred more commonly in anakinra recipients than in placebo recipients, but were a rare cause for discontinuation of anakinra therapy (=1%) in clinical trials."

RESULTS: The sample was homogeneous at baseline, and there were no withdrawals. Improvement was observed in both groups in relation to T0, but no statistically significant differences between groups were observed regarding all variables at the time points studied. The Sm/TH group exhibited more adverse effects at T1 (p<0.05), but these were mild and transitory. No severe adverse effects were reported during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Intra-articular injection of Samarium153-particulate hydroxyapatite (15 mCi) with 40 mg of triamcinolone hexacetonide is not superior to triamcinolone hexacetonide alone for the treatment of knee synovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis at 1 y of follow-up."

The conventional therapeutic dosing scheme is a loading dose of 100 mg/day for 3 days followed by 20 mg/day thereafter. Eliminating the 3-day loading dose may decrease the risk of adverse effects, most of Rheumatologists don't use the loading dose any more. Objective. To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Leflunomide (LFN) 100mg/week compared to Methotrexate (MTX) 10mg/week in a randomized, controlled trial with 26 weeks of follow up in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. Patients and Methods. 40 Libyan Patients who met The 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA and presented with active disease were included. All patients had medical records, including laboratory tests and hand X-rays. Clinical evaluations for improvement and ACR and EULAR response criteria were performed. Statistical analysis for independent's samples between both groups defined a p value of <=.05. Safety was evaluated by comparing the proportion of adverse events (AE) registered. Results. 40 patients were screened and randomized: 20 patients received 100 mg LFN weekly and 20 patients received MTX 10 mg per week, all received 10mg prednisone daily for two weeks followed by 5mg for another 4 weeks, NSAIDs were allowed during the entire study period on demand, all patients had regular follow up for 26 weeks. All 40 patients completed the study.. ACR20 improvement criteria were achieved by LFN group in 100%, and in 95% by the MTX group at week 26, ACR 50 improvement was achieved in 90% of both groups, ACR 70 in 80% in the LEF group and 75% in the MTX group at the end of the study. At the beginning of the study DAS28 was 5.85 and improved to3.07 in the LFN group versus 5,92 and 3.22 in the MTX group. AE for each group was 1 patient in the LFN group, and 2 patients in the MTX group. Regarding safety, no serious AE of a life threatening nature were reported. Conclusion. Leflunomide 100 mg weekly is adequately effective and safe as 10 mg Methotrexate per week in the treatment of active Rheumatoid Arthritis after 26 weeks of follow up."

Similarly, ACR50 and ACR70 responses of Leining group were significantly higher than those of placebo group (40.30 vs. 22.73 %; p < 0.001 and 16.67 vs. 7.27 %; p < 0.05, respectively). DAS28-ESR in Leining group was significantly reduced compared to that in placebo group, with greater clinically meaningful (>1.2 unit) improvement (54.85 vs. 29.09 %, p < 0.05). Both the rates of remission (DAS28-ESR < 2.6) and low disease activity (DAS28-ESR < 3.2) were greater in the Leining group than those in the placebo group (12.42 vs. 2.73 %; p < 0.05 and 15.45 vs. 2.73 %; p < 0.05 respectively). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both Leining and placebo groups. No neutralizing antibodies were detected. Leining demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy compared with placebo in Chinese patients with active RA despite MTX therapy. Administration of Leining in combination with MTX for 24 weeks was well tolerated. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

CSF1R activation produces inflammatory cytokines responsible for joint destruction, thus pathway inhibition may provide a therapeutic benefit to RA patients (pts). FPA008 is a humanized IgG4 anti-CSF1R antibody that blocks ligand binding and has preclinical activity in models of arthritis. This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled first-inhuman trial designed in 3 parts to study safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers. In Parts 1 & 2, healthy volunteers received either one or two doses, respectively. Part 3 will be in RA pts, and clinical and radiographic efficacy parameters will also be explored. Methods: In Part 1, 8 subjects were randomized (3:1) to receive a single intravenous infusion of FPA008 or placebo, per dose cohort of 0.2, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg. In Part 2, 8 subjects were randomized (3:1) to receive 2 doses of FPA008 or placebo administered 14 days apart, at 1 or 3 mg/kg. Dose escalation decisions were based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), plus attributed adverse events (AEs) beyond the DLT period. PK, bone turnover biomarkers, CSF1 and IL34 serum concentrations, and CD16+ monocytes were assessed. Part 3 consists of an open-label evaluation of 3 dose levels in RA pts whose disease is not responding to methotrexate. Three pts per dose level will receive 2 doses of FPA008 administered 14 days apart. Thereafter, 30 new pts will be randomized (2:2:1) to one of two dose levels of FPA008 or placebo, respectively. Results: As of May 30, 2014, the first 5 cohorts in Parts 1 and 2 (up to 1 mg/kg, two doses) were completed through the DLT period. No DLTs were reported. Frequently reported AEs were Grade 1 or 2 pruritus, headache and periorbital edema. Dosing in the 10 mg/kg cohort was associated with moderate periorbital edema, facial and finger swelling, and mild, transient blurred vision outside the DLT period. Dose-dependent elevations of CK and LDH were noted at 1 mg/kg and above; AST elevation occurred at 3 mg/kg and above; and mild ALT elevation occurred at 10 mg/kg in one subject. These elevations were not associated with clinical signs/symptoms or abnormalities in total bilirubin, CK isoenzymes or troponin, were reversible, and were expected due to FPA008-mediated inhibition of Kupffer cells responsible for removing these enzymes. Non-linear PK was observed, with exposure increasing greater than dose proportionality from 0.2 to 3 mg/kg, suggesting target mediated clearance. Suppression of CD16+ monocytes, decreased bone turn-over biomarkers (CTx, Trap5), and dose-dependent increase in serum CSF1 and IL34 concentrations were observed. Conclusion: FPA008 is well tolerated up to 3 mg/kg. Persistent AEs beyond the DLT period at 10 mg/kg coincide with the prolonged PK exposure. PD effects of full suppression of non-classical CD16+ monocytes and decrease of bone turnover biomarkers were noted at dose levels tested and may track with clinical benefit in RA pts. Updated data including preliminary data in RA pts will be presented."

It has major impact on patients through disability and associated comorbidities. Current treatment strategies have considerably improved the prognosis, but recent innovations (especially biologic drugs and the new class of so-called ""JAK/STAT inhibitors"") have important safety issues and are very costly. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are highly effective in RA, and could reduce the need for expensive treatment with biologic agents. However, despite more than 65 years of clinical experience, there is a lack of studies large enough to adequately document the benefit/harm balance. The result is inappropriate treatment strategies, i.e. both under-use and over-use of GCs, and consequently suboptimal treatment of RA., METHODS: The GLORIA study is a pragmatic multicentre, 2-year, randomised, double-blind, clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of a daily dose of 5 mg prednisolone or matching placebo added to standard of care in elderly patients with RA. Eligible participants are diagnosed with RA, have inadequate disease control (disease activity score, DAS28 >= 2.6), and are >= 65 years. The primary outcome measures are the time-averaged mean value of the DAS28 and the occurrence of serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest. During the trial, change in antirheumatic therapy is permitted as clinically indicated, except for GCs. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility are secondary outcomes. The main challenge is the interpretation of the trial result with two primary endpoints and the pragmatic trial design that allows co-interventions. Another challenge is the definition of safety and the relative lack of power to detect differences between treatment groups. We have chosen to define safety as the number of patients experiencing at least one serious adverse event. We also specify a decision tree to guide our conclusion on the balance of benefit and harm, and our methodology to combat potential confounding caused by co-interventions., DISCUSSION: Pragmatic trials minimise impact on daily practice and maximise clinical relevance of the results, but analysis and interpretation of the results is challenging. We expect that the results of this trial are of importance for all rheumatologists who treat elderly patients with RA., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02585258 .

In a randomised controlled trial, a control group-which received a group-based patient education session led by a physical therapist-was compared to a treatment group which received the education session plus a motivational interview from a physical therapist and two self-regulation coaching sessions from a rheumatology nurse. Outcomes included leisure-time PA, days per week with at least 30 min of moderate-intensity PA, self-efficacy and autonomous motivation (cognitions which predict PA initiation and maintenance), disease activity, functional status, depressive symptoms and fatigue. Effects were assessed using mixed models repeated measures. Of the 78 patients randomised, 76 and 67 completed the post-treatment and follow-up assessments, respectively. Significant treatment effects were found for leisure-time PA (p = 0.022), active days/week (p = 0.016), self-efficacy (p = 0.008) and autonomous motivation (p = 0.001). At post-treatment and 6-months follow-up, significantly more treated patients than controls met current PA recommendations. No significant effects were found for disease activity, functional status, depressive symptoms or fatigue. Combining motivation- and action-focused intervention approaches improved PA-related cognitions and led to improved uptake and maintenance of leisure-time PA. However, further research is necessary to identify ways of helping patients with RA transition to-and maintain-more intensive forms of PA which are more likely to improve disease activity and functional status. ¬© 2013 Clinical Rheumatology."

Methods: CONDOR was a 6-month, prospective, double-blind, triple-dummy, parallel-group, randomized, multicenter trial comparing celecoxib 200 mg twice daily versus diclofenac slow release (SR) 75 mg twice daily plus omeprazole 20 mg daily. Patients were Helicobacter pylori negative, had osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), were aged >=60 years, were with or without a history of gastroduodenal ulceration, or were >=18 years with previous gastroduodenal ulceration. Patients' Global Assessment of Arthritis was determined at each study visit. Results: A total of 4484 patients were randomized to treatment (2238 celecoxib, 2246 diclofenac SR) and included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Least squares mean (LSM) (standard error [SE]) for Patients' Global Assessment of Arthritis was 3.219 (0.017) and 3.221 (0.017) at baseline for celecoxib and diclofenac SR (p=0.90).

9738916,,10.4162/nrp.2015.9.2.186,"Introduction and Objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease. Control of inflammation leads to remission in RA. It has been proved that dietary factors are very important in mitigating inflammation and symptoms of the disease including numbers of swollen and tender joints. Among these dietary factors, vitamin K which has been a very interesting subject recently, has been reported as an anti-inflammatory agents in some latest published papers. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the effects of phylloquinone on disease activity score in RA patients. Material and Methods: In present double-blind clinical trial, 58 women with definite RA, who fulfilled the eligibility criteria, were participated in the study. Being pregnant, lactate or post-menopause, using dietary supplements during past 6 months and having other disorders were excluded from the study. Then, patients were allocated in two groups randomly. One group received vitamin K1 tablet (10 mg/day) (n = 30), and the placebo group (n = 28) took a similar tablet without any pharmacological effect for 8 weeks. Demographic information was obtained through face to face interview. And, DAS-28 which is a standard quantitative measure of disease activity in RA was assayed by rheumatology specialist at baseline and at the end of intervention. Results: 70.7% of patients were classified in remission, 19% in mild, 8.6% in moderate and 1.7% in severe groups. DAS28 wasn't significantly different between two groups at baseline (P value >0.05). However, after the intervention a significant reduction (2.07%) in DAS28 was observed in vitamin K group (P value = 0.041). Discussion and Conclusion: Vitamin K1 decreased DAS28 significantly. This finding revealed that vitamin K supplementation in combination with other disease-modifying anti rheumatic drugs might be an effective promising factor in relieving RA symptoms. It seems more investigations in this field are needed."

We therefore conducted a trial of atorvastatin treatment in recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The randomized placebo-controlled Diabetes and Atorvastatin (DIATOR) trial included patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and islet autoantibodies, between 18-39 years of age, in 12 centers in Germany. Patients were randomized to receive placebo or 80 mg/d atorvastatin (starting dose of 40 mg/d for 4 weeks) for 18 months. As primary outcome serum C-peptide levels were determined before and 90 min after a standardized liquid mixed meal (Boost HP). Statistical evaluation was performed by SAS with tests appropriate for (log)normal or non-Gaussian distribution of respective data. Of 89 patients included (mean age 30 years, 40 % females) 21 dropped out before the one year visit (8 placebo, 13 atorvastatin). The intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant preservation of C-peptide secretion with atorvastatin treatment, In the placebo group median fasting serum C-peptide levels dropped from baseline to 12 and 18 months (from 0. 34 to 0.23 and 0.20 nmol/l, p < 0.001) whereas levels remained stable in the atorvastatin group (from 0.34 to 0.30 nmol/l at 18 months, ns). Median stimulated C-peptide concentrations declined until 12 months in both groups (placebo from 0.89 to 0.71 nmol/l, atorvastatin from 0.88 to 0.73 nmol/l, p < 0.01 each) followed by a major loss by month 18 in the placebo group (to 0.48 nmol/l, p=0.047) but not in the atorvastatin group (to 0.71 nmol/l, ns).

After a 2-week washout period during which the patients were given only paracetamol, the drugs were allocated at random and administered for 2 weeks. Both products resulted in a statically significant improvement of all parameters compared with pre-test findings. Comparison of the effects of the compounds yielded no statistically significant difference. Three patients complained of side effects on flurbiprofen and 3 on indometacin; in one case, indometacin had to be discontinued. In a subsequent control open study, the efficacy and tolerability of flurbiprofen were studied in another 30 patients, with the dosage being adjusted to the activity of the rheumatoid arthritis. This trial also confirmed the efficacy and tolerability of flurbiprofen."
9738937,http://www.nature.com/articles/ncpgasthep0963,10.1038/ncpgasthep0963,"A Cochrane review (6 randomized controlled trials, N=1689, mean duration 5.8 weeks) assessed the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen in the management of osteoarthritis, comparing it with placebo and NSAIDs. Acetaminophen was superior to placebo in pain reduction and global assessment (number needed to treat [NNT]=2) with a similar safety profile. NSAIDs were better than acetaminophen in pain reduction, patient (NNT=6) and physician global assessment (NNT=17), but no better for functional improvement. Compared with nonselective NSAIDs, acetaminophen led to fewer withdrawals (number needed to harm [NNH]=20) and fewer GI adverse events (NNH=9), but there was no statistical difference when compared with COX-2 selective NSAIDs. Another Cochrane review (26 randomized controlled trials) found that rofecoxib (Vioxx) was more effective than placebo (NNT=5), and equally effective with other NSAIDs in the management of osteoarthritis. They reported fewer GI adverse events (endoscopically observed gastric erosion and ulcers) with rofecoxib than with other NSAIDs-naproxen (Naprosyn), ibuprofen (Motrin), diclofenac (Cataflam), nabumetone (Relafen), diclofenac/misoprostol (Arthrotec), and nimesulide. However, the withdrawal rate due to adverse events and the increase in blood pressure and edema were significantly greater with rofecoxib than placebo at 6 weeks. Two Cochrane reviews confirmed the efficacy of celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib in treating of rheumatoid arthritis. One review included 2 RCTs (N=8734) with a placebo arm (8 weeks) and naproxen arm (9 months). The rofecoxib groups (25 mg, 50 mg) had more responders than the placebo group (NNT=8 and 6 respectively). Compared with naproxen (1 g), no difference was seen in efficacy in the OMERACT outcomes (Outcome Measures for Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials), but all combined GI adverse events (perforation, ulcer, obstruction, bleeding, and all episodes of GI bleeding) were significantly reduced at 9 months (NNH=20). The withdrawals were the same in the 3 groups. Compared with placebo, the rofecoxib groups had similar incidence of elevated blood pressure and edema (NNH=50 and 100, respectively). Compared with the naproxen group, no difference was seen in renal adverse events, but total cardiovascular thrombotic events (NNH=200) and nonfatal MI (NNH=300) increased at 9 months in the 50 mg rofecoxib group. Similar cardiovascular adverse events were reported in the APPROVE trial. In this study, patients taking rofecoxib 25 mg daily for 18 months had increased total thrombotic events (MI, stroke, peripheral arterial and venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism) when compared with placebo (NNH=63). A recent study also raised the same concern of increased cardiovascular adverse events with celecoxib. This study demonstrated an increase risk of cardiovascular events (combined death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure) for patients taking celecoxib 200 mg twice a day (NNH=77) or 400 mg twice a day (NNH=42). Many patients taking low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection also frequently require treatment of pain and inflammation with a NSAID. Even low-dose aspirin (75 mg/d) is known to be associated with increased GI toxicity (ulcers and hemorrhages). A recent double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial found that 12 weeks of treatment with a combination of low-dose aspirin and a COX-2 selective NSAID (rofecoxib) had more than twice the incidence of endoscopically confirmed gastric and duodenal ulcers, compared with aspirin alone, and no difference with a nonselective NSAID. This has raised the safety concern of concomitant use of a COX-2 selective NSAID with low-dose aspirin."

Aim: The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine anti-inflammatory properties of statins in rheumatoid arthritis. Materials and Methods: Eighty Iranian patients with rheumatoid arthritis, aged between 19 to 75 years were recruited to take part in this randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups to take atorvastatin or placebo 40 mg daily as an adjunct to current disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) treatment. Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), swollen joint count (SJC) & tender joint count (TJC) were assessed before and after three months intervention. Results: Analysis was based on intention to treat. DAS28 significantly declined in the atorvastatin group in comparison with placebo (p< 0.001). SJC, TJC, CRP and ESR also were significantly dropped in the atorvastatin group in comparison with placebo. Conclusion: It can be concluded that atorvastatin can suppress RA activity and inflmmatory factors in RA patients for high to moderate grade of inflmmation.Copyright ¬© 2016, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

9738947,,10.3899/jrheum.100866,"Purpose of Study: The present randomized controlled study addressed whether sonographic needle guidance affected the outcomes of intraarticular injection for inflammatory arthritis. Methods Used: 244 symptomatic joints (3% small, 51% intermediate, and 46% large joints) with inflammatory arthritis (76% rheumatoid arthritis) were-randomized to injection by conventional palpation-guided anatomic injection (120 joints) or sonographic image-guided injection enhanced with a-one-handed RPD (the reciprocating procedure device) mechanical syringe (124 joints). A one needle, two-syringe technique was used. After intraarticular placement and synovial space dilation were confirmed by sonography, a syringe exchange was performed, and triamcinolone acetonide was injected with the second syringe through the indwelling intraarticular needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, pain at outcome (2 weeks and 6 months), responders, therapeutic duration, reinjection rates, total cost, and cost per responder were determined. Summary of Results: Relative to conventional palpation-guided methods, sonographic guidance for injection of inflammatory arthritis resulted in 81% reduction in injection pain (p<0.001), a 35% reduction in pain scores at outcome (p<0.02), 38% increase in the responder rate (p<0.003), 34% reduction in the non-responder rate (p<0.003), a 32% increase in therapeutic duration (p =0.01), a 8% reduction ($7) in cost/patient/year, and a 33% ($64) reduction in cost/responder/year for a hospital outpatient (p<0.001). Conclusions: Sonographic needle guidance improves the performance, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of intraarticular injections of inflammatory arthritis. (Figure Presented)."

Methods: Patients with active RA (< 2 years from symptoms onset) were treated with prednisolone 5 mg daily or placebo for 2 years in a double blind, randomized, multi-center study. At the same time in all patients DMARD treatment with either gold sodium thiomalate (GSTM) or methotrexate (MTX) was started; in the case of side effects or inefficacy the medication could be switched to the other DMARD. Radiographs of hands and forefeet were taken at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24 months. All radiographs were evaluated by one observer (S.W.) knowing the time sequence of the film but unaware of the patient identity or treatment using the Ratingen score and van der Heijde's modification of Sharp's method. Results: 196 patients were included; 76 patients completed the study per protocol. Of these patients 34 were treated with prednisolone, 42 with placebo, 48 initially with GSTM, 28 with MTX. 17 patients switched from GSTM to MTX, 1 from MTX to GSTM. The mean values of the radiographic scores of both groups are given in the table. During the first year, especially during the first 6 months, the radiographic progression within the prednisolone group was significantly lower than in the placebo group: the Sharp erosion score increased by 0.4% of the maximum possible score during the first and the second 6 months in the prednisolone group, while in the placebo group there was an increase of 1.8% during the first 6 months and 0.8% during the second 6 months. During the second year the progression was significantly lower (-0.1% in the prednisolone group, 0.2% in the placebo group). After 24 months the total score had increased by 2.6% of the maximum score in the placebo group and by 1.1% in the prednisolone group. The results of the completers were confirmed by the intention-to-treat analysis (80 patients in the prednisolone group, 86 patients in the placebo group). Conclusion: Continuous low dose prednisolone treatment with 5 mg daily over 2 years administered in addition to conventional DMARD treatment with MTX or GSTM decreases radiographic progression in early RA. The results of the study also show that in the placebo group there is a sharp decrease of the progression after 6-12 months as a result of the DMARD treatment. During the second year there is nearly no progression in this group. The data of the 'completers' are confirmed by the analysis of the 'intention to treat' population."

However, as no drug therapy at present leads to long-term remission for all individuals with RA, people continue to experience physical, psychological and functional consequences which could benefit from rehabilitation. The aim of this study is to consider the value of group exercise therapy for people with RA on anti-TNF therapy. Methods: A convenience sample of people with RA on anti-TNF medication was recruited. Participants were randomised into one of 3 groups; a gym based exercise group, a hydrotherapy based exercise group and a control group. The gym and hydrotherapy exercise group interventions consisted of flexibility, strengthening and aerobic exercises. The format of these groups was determined by analysis of semistructured interviews with 13 physiotherapists experienced in rheumatology and hydrotherapy. The classes lasted 1 hour and were carried out twice weekly for 8 weeks. The control group received no intervention. Participants were assessed by a blind assessor at baseline, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post baseline. The primary outcome measure was the HAQ. Secondary outcome measures included the 50 ft Walk Test and the Timed Chair Stand Test. The data was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: Twenty nine people (9 male/20 female) with a mean age of 56.52 (+/-9.77) years have been recruited to date. The mean length of diagnosis is 13.45 (+/- 9.48) years and the mean length of time taking anti-TNF medication is 3.41 (+/- 2.15) years. No significant difference was noted in the degree of change in the HAQ between the groups at the 8 week and 24 week evaluations. The Timed Chair Stand Test showed a significant improvement in both the gym and hydrotherapy groups compared to the control group at 8 weeks (p<0.05). This improvement was maintained in the hydrotherapy group at 24 weeks. The 50ft Walk Test also showed significant improvement in both the gym and hydrotherapy groups at 8 weeks compared to the control group (p<0.05). Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that participation in either a gym based or hydrotherapy based exercise group improves function for people with RA on anti-TNFalpha therapy. This is shown by significant improvements in the Timed Chair Stand and 50ft Walk Tests. Recruitment for this study is ongoing."

Although disease activity may be managed effectively with prescription drugs, unproven treatments such as magnet therapy are sometimes used as an adjunct for pain control. Therapeutic devices incorporating permanent magnets are widely available and easy to use. Magnets may also be perceived as a more natural and less harmful alternative to analgesic compounds. Of interest to health service researchers is the possibility that magnet therapy might help to reduce the economic burden of managing chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Magnets are extremely cheap to manufacture and prolonged treatment involves a single cost. Despite this, good quality scientific evidence concerning the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of magnet therapy is scarce. The primary aim of the CAMBRA trial is to investigate the effectiveness of magnet therapy for relieving pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Methods/Design: The CAMBRA trial employs a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Participant will each wear four devices: a commercially available magnetic wrist strap; an attenuated wrist strap; a demagnetised wrist strap; and a copper bracelet. Device will be allocated in a randomised sequence and each worn for five weeks. The four treatment phases will be separated by wash out periods lasting one week. Both participants and researchers will be blind, as far as feasible, to the allocation of experimental and control devices. In total 69 participants will be recruited from general practices within the UK. Eligible patients will have a verified diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis that is being managed using drugs, and will be experiencing chronic pain. Outcomes measured will include pain, inflammation, disease activity, physical function, medication use, affect, and health related costs. Data will be collected using questionnaires, diaries, manual pill counts and blood tests. Discussion: Magnetism is an inherent property of experimental devices which is hard to conceal. The use of multiple control devices, including a copper bracelet, represents a concerted attempt to overcome methodological limitations associated with trials in this field. The trial began in July 2007. At the time of submission (August 2008) recruitment has finished, with 70 trial participants, and data collection is almost complete. ¬© 2008 Richmond; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Methodology: One hundred and twenty subjects were enrolled in the study in a ratio of 1:1, assuming 20% dropouts to obtain 96 evaluable subjects at day 84; that is, 60 subjects were randomly allocated to homoeopathic treatment arm, while another 60 were allocated placebo. Proportion of patients with an ACR20 response in both treatment groups on day 84 was compared with baseline. Another secondary variable was the change from baseline in disease activity score 28 C reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) on day 84. Results: Out of 120 subjects, 16 subjects dropped out and 104 subjects completed the study. In the study out of 104 subjects, 54 subjects received homoeopathic medicines: there were 13 (23%) ACR20 responders in the treatment arm and 41 (77%) subjects were ACR20 non-responders. There were 50 subjects who received placebo, out of whom 3 (6%) subjects were ACR20 responders and the remaining 47 (94%) subjects were nonresponders. No remarkable change was seen with placebo in DAS28-CRP. There was a positive relation between baseline DAS28-CRP as compared with DAS28-CRP on the 84th day. Conclusion: Homoeopathic medicines have significant effect in patients with RA, and homoeopathic treatment lowers the intake of pain killer. A study of longer duration is needed."

This clinical trial was performed on 27 patients, 15 being treated with clopirac and 12 with indomethacin. Clopirac treatment improved significantly ESR and grip strength; indomethacin reduced plasma fibrinogen level. Both treatments equally reduced the articular pain. Subjective assessments by the patients of the effect of the treatment indicated that the percentage of improvements was higher in the group treated with clopirac. Side effects necessitating cessation of treatment were observed in one single case in the clopirac group, and none in the indomethacin group. Occurrence of minor side effects was comparable in both groups."

There is still a lack of effective therapy to treat RA. The Juanbi pill is a Chinese medicine that has been widely used to treat active RA in China for hundreds of years, relieving pain and protecting the affected joints from malformation. However, there is no solid evidence to show the effect of the Juanbi pill on the management of active RA., METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether the traditional Chinese medicine Juanbi pill could relieve joint pain in RA and protect the joints. A total of 120 patients with active RA will be enrolled and treated with the Juanbi pill or a placebo for 3 months. The primary outcome measures are as follows: rate of in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)50, change in the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) from baseline at beginning of therapy to 3 months, and a change in the van der Heijde modified Sharp score measured from baseline to 12 months. The secondary outcome measures are as follows: rate of change in ACR20, ACR70, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and change in score in the Patient Assessment of Arthritis Pain, Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis, and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) from baseline to 2-week, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow up. In addition, the rate of change (score) in the ACR50 and DAS28 from the baseline to 2-week, 1-month, 2-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow up are also the secondary outcome measures., DISCUSSION: Although the Juanbi pill has been used in China for many years to treat RA, there is a lack of consensus about its effectiveness. This trial will provide convincing evidence about the effect of Juanbi pill on active RA., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02885597 . Registered on 30 August 2016."

These multicenter studies were conducted by eight investigators. Overall, the two drugs brought significant and similar improvements in both indications. Benoxaprofen responses were significantly better for several rheumatoid arthritis efficacy measurements, while indomethacin exhibited better responses in some osteoarthritis parameters. Adverse effects were similar for both drugs but fewer drug-related side effects were observed with benoxaprofen. Mild to moderate gastrointestinal complaints were reported with both drugs. In the rheumatoid arthritis study, onycholysis appeared in three patients taking indomethacin although two had received benoxaprofen as first therapy. Unfavorable trends in some laboratory values occurred in nearly twice as many patients on indomethacin. These results were obtained with once-daily benoxaprofen dosage compared to three-times-daily administration of indomethacin at total daily doses titrated to the individual patients."
9739050,,10.2165/00003495-200059040-00017,"Celecoxib is a cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor that exhibits relative in vitro and ex vivo selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1. Results of randomised double-blind multicentre studies indicate that celecoxib is superior to placebo and has similar efficacy as conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in improving the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Analgesic efficacy and improvements in functional status are apparent within 2 weeks of starting therapy and are maintained throughout treatment. Available data suggest that celecoxib has analgesic efficacy in patients with postsurgical dental pain, although this is yet to be confirmed. In patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, celecoxib 100 and 200mg and naproxen 500mg twice daily were similar efficacious and superior to placebo. Once and twice daily celecoxib dosage regimens provided comparable efficacy. Improvements in physical function paralleled those in pain relief. Celecoxib also has efficacy in treating the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hip. The effects of celecoxib were not diminished in elderly patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. All dosages of celecoxib (100 to 400mg twice daily) and naproxen 500mg twice daily produced significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with stable rheumatoid arthritis, celecoxib 200mg twice daily showed sustained symptomatic improvements similar to those of twice daily slow-release diclofenac 75mg over a 24-week period. Celecoxib was well tolerated in clinical trials. Upper gastrointestinal complications occurred in significantly fewer patients treated with twice daily celecoxib 25 to 400mg than in those receiving comparator NSAIDs. There was no evidence of a dose relationship in endoscopic ulcer development and incidences in celecoxib and placebo recipients were lower than in those receiving twice daily naproxen 500mg or ibuprofen 800mg 3 times daily. Conclusions: Celecoxib is the first COX-2 specific inhibitor approved for use in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Celecoxib produces significant improvements in pain and inflammation and these effects are maintained during treatment for up 24 weeks in clinical trials. Studies indicate that celecoxib has similar efficacy to conventional NSAIDs in relieving pain and improving functional status, but is associated with a lower incidence of upper gastrointestinal ulceration and complications. This promising gastrointestinal safety profile, together with sustained symptomatic relief, places celecoxib as a useful alternative for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in patients at high risk of developing gastrointestinal events. Although data are encouraging, its place in acute pain states remains to be established."

However, its adaptation and efficacies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) still lack reliable evidence and also no previous reports directly compared the results of these two switching treatments. Methods: 194 patients with RA treated by BP [177 female, 65.9 years old, disease duration 17.8 years, RF positivity 77.8%, DAS28-CRP 2.3, 75.8% with oral prednisolone (PSL) 3.6mg/day, 23.2% with biologics, prior BP duration 40.0 months, prior vertebral fracture rate 41.8%, T-scores: lumbar spine (LS) -1.8, femoral neck (FN) -2.3, total hip (TH) -2.0] were allocated to either the (1) BP-continued group (BP; n=80), (2) switched-to-DMAb group (DMAb; n=74), or (3) switched-to-TPTD group (TPTD; n=40) based on each physicians' decision and followed up for 12 months by monitoring bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score (TBS), bone turnover markers, and fracture incidence. Results: At baseline, TPTD group showed significantly lower T-scores than BP group in all resions (P<0.05), while no significant differences were observed between DMAb and BP group, and DMAb and TPTD group. Changes of BMD from baseline->6->12 months were as follows. (1) BP group: LS; 0->1.1->2.5%, TH; 0->0.3->0.2%, FN; 0->0.5->0.8%, (2) DMAb group: LS; 0->2.8->4.9%, TH; 0->1.5->3.0%, FN; 0->2.0->3.9%, (3) TPTD group: LS; 0->4.2->6.0%, TH; 0->-1.4->1.4%, FN; 0->-1.1->2.1%. TBS changed from baseline to 12 months as follows. (1) BP group: -1.4%, (2) DMAb group: 0.4%, (3) TPTD group: 2.7%. DMAb group showed significant increase in LS, TH, and FN BMD (P<0.01) and maintained TBS (P<0.01) compared to BP group at 12 months, and TPTD group showed significant increase in LS BMD (P<0.01) and TBS (P<0.001) compared to BP group at 12 months. TPTD group showed similar increase in LS, TH, and FN BMD, while significantly increased TBS (P<0.05) compared to DMAb group at 12 months. Changes of bone turnover markers were as follows. (1) BP group: bone resorption marker, TRACP-5b; 0->-3.5->1.4%, bone formation marker, PINP; 0->-9.6->- 13.4%, (2) DMAb group: TRACP-5b; 0->-28.5->-27.9%, PINP; 0->-14.5->-17.6%, (3) TPTD group: TRACP-5b; 0->77.1->77.6%, PINP; 0->296.5->227.7%. DMAb group showed significant decrease in TRACP-5b (P<0.001), and TPTD group showed significant increase in TRACP-5b and PINP (P<0.001) compared to BP and DMAb group at 12 months. The fracture incidence during this period was (1) BP group: 3.8% (1 vertebra, 1 forearm, and 1 humerus), (2) DMAb group: 1.4% (1 rib), (3) TPTD group: 2.5% (1 toe). DMAb and TPTD group showed no major fractures during this period. Conclusion: Switching oral BP to DMAb significantly increased LS, TH, and FN BMD, and decreased TRACP-5b, while switching to TPTD increased LS BMD, TBS, and total bone turnover at most compared to continuing BP at 12 months. Our results indicate that switching BP to DMAb or TPTD by determining treatment target may provide useful treatment option in RA associated osteoporosis."

Visual feedback is a relatively new tool that enables the patients to visualize and monitor a real-time change of their disease activity parameters as well as the patient's reported outcome measures. Integrating electronic data recording in the standard rheumatology clinical practice made visual feedback possible. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of using the visual feedback in patients with early inflammatory arthritis (EA) and how ubiquitous computing technology can improve the patients' compliance and adherence to therapy. Methods: This was a double-blind randomized controlled study, which included 111 patients diagnosed to have EA according to the new ACR/EULAR criteria. All patients received DMARDs therapy and were monitored over the period of 1-year. By the 6th month of treatment, the patients were randomly allocated to an active group (55 patients) to who the visual feedback (visualization of the charts showing the disease progression) was added to their management protocol, and a control group (56 patients) who continued their routine management. The patients were monitored for another 6-months period. All the patient's disease activity parameters, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), medications and co-morbidity scores were recorded using the EROMIA software [1]. Primary outcome was the patients' adherence to their medications; change in disease activity score (DAS-28) and PROMs. Secondary outcome was the outcome of a questionnaire completed by every patient in both the active group and control group (using VAS) by the end of 1-year of management, to rate the patient's perspective regarding their condition and treatment. Results: The visual feedback provided a significant reduction of disease activity parameters as well as improvement of the patients' adherence to anti-rheumatic therapy (p<0.01). Also stopping the DMARDs therapy because of intolerance was significantly less in the active group. The improvement of disease activity parameters was associated with improvement in functional disability and quality of life scores. Mean changes in disease parameters showed no significant differences at 3 and 6 months of therapy but differences were statistically significant at 12 months follow up (p<0.01). Medication compliance was significantly correlated with changes in all measured disease parameters Conclusions: By recording and monitoring disease activity electronically and introducting visual feedback therapy into clinical practice, a new experience can be created. Visual feedback enabled the patients to see how they are doing regarding their disease activity and helped to optimize their adherence to their treatment. Visual feedback had a positive and significant impact on the disease activity control."

The results on 30 patients with classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis are tabulated and discussed. With the criteria of assessment based on the systemic index and articular index of Lansbury and measuring finger-joint swelling by means of jewellers' ring-gauges it was not possible to show that indomethacin produced any antiphlogistic effect that held statistical validity. The de tumescent and analgesic effects demonstrated were shown to be the result of placebo and learning factors. A tendency for indomethacin to accelerate the rate of erythrocyte sedimentation was revealed, and evidence for a specific antifatigue effect of the drug in rheumatoid arthritic patients is presented. Side effects are listed. Though they occurred more often with indomethacin, the incidence type, and pattern were the same with both drug and placebo.

Use of item response theory (IRT) and, subsequently, computerized adaptive testing (CAT), under the umbrella of the NIH-PROMIS initiative (National Institutes of Health - Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), to bring strong new assets to the development of more sensitive, more widely applicable, and more efficiently administered patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments. We present data on current progress in 3 crucial areas: floor and ceiling effects, responsiveness to change, and interactive computer-based administration over the Internet. Methods. We examined nearly 1000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases in a series of studies including a one-year longitudinal examination of detection of change; compared responsiveness of the Legacy SF-36 and HAQ-DI instruments with IRT-based instruments; performed a randomized head-to-head trial of 4 modes of item administration; and simulated the effect of lack of floor and ceiling items upon statistical power and sample sizes. Results. IRT-based PROMIS instruments are more sensitive to change, resulting in the potential to reduce sample size requirements substantially by up to a factor of 4. The modes of administration tested did not differ from each other in any instance by more than one-tenth of a standard deviation. Floor and ceiling effects greatly reduce the number of available subjects, particularly at the ceiling. Conclusion. Failure to adequately address floor and ceiling effects, which determine the range of an instrument, can result in suboptimal assessment of many patients. Improved items, improved instruments, and computer-based administration improve PRO assessment and represent a fundamental advance in clinical outcomes research.

It has been shown that leflunomide is effective in treating active rheumatoid arthritis(RA) in a placebo-controlled phase II study. Subsequent multinational, randomized, controlled phase III clinical trials demonstrated that leflunomide is as effective and safe as methotrexate and sulfasalazine in treatment of RA.

Methods: Adult RA pts (n=643), with persistent disease activity while receiving MTX>15 mg/wk for at least 3mos, were randomized to IV placebo+MTX (n=129) or GLM 2- or 4 mg/kg, both with and without MTX, q12wks (n=514) up to Wk96 [median 68.4 wks]. Pts who received IV GLM completing the Wk48 database lock were eligible to participate in the long term extension (LTE) and receive open label GLM 50mg SC q4wks for an additional 24wks (E-0 to E-24) and 16wks of safety follow-up (E-24 to E-40) with and without MTX. At Wk E-14, changes in concomitant RA medication (including MTX) were permitted at the investigators discretion. Results: Of the 505 pts who entered the LTE, 186 pts who did not change dosing strategy during the IV phase (GLM IV 2 mg/kg IV+MTX [n=82]; GLM IV 4 mg/kg+MTX [n=104]) participated in the LTE at Wk E-0; baseline demographics and disease characteristics were comparable between both groups. Through Wk E-0, ACR20, ACR50, and DAS28-CRP (good or moderate) response was achieved by 67.5%, 61.9%, 43.4% and 39.2%, 87.7% 82.1% in the IV GLM 2 mg/ kg and 4 mg/kg groups, respectively. Overall efficacy (ACR20, ACR50) and improvements in ACR components were sustained or improved in a majority of pts through Wk E-24 regardless of GLM IV dose: ACR20 was achieved by 85.7% IV GLM 2 mg/kg patients and 90.8% IV GLM 4 mg/kg patients, ACR50 was achieved by 77.8% and 82.1%, respectively. Compared with the IV phase, DAS 28 response and CRP measures improved with SC GLM. The rates of GLM SC discontinuations from Wk E-0 through Wk E-24 were 2.4% and 4.8% in pts previously treated with IV GLM 2- and 4 mg/kg, respectively, most commonly for adverse events (AEs). A total of 77.5% and 83.0% of patients in the GLM IV 2- and 4mg/kg groups, respectively, experienced >1 AEs through Wk E-0. Rates of infusion reactions remained lower in GLM-treated pts compared with placebotreated pts. During the LTE (Wk E-0 through Wk E-40), 69.5% of SC GLM-treated pts experienced >1 AE; 13.7% and 14.0% of pts previously treated with GLM IV 2- and 4 mg/kg, respectively, experienced >1 serious AE. Injection site reactions were rare [0.6% (19/3443)]. Conclusions: In pts switched to SC GLM 50mg through the LTE, overall efficacy was sustained or improved regardless of whether pts previously received IV GLM 2-or 4 mg/kg. Both IV and SC GLM were well tolerated with acceptable safety profiles."
9739103,,10.4088/pcc.11m01296,"Objective: The purpose of this post hoc analysis was to compare the treatment effect size of eszopiclone 3 mg for insomnia in patients with a diagnosis of primary insomnia and in several of the psychiatric and medical conditions that are most commonly comorbid with insomnia. Method: Data were analyzed from 5 large, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients of at least 1 month duration published between 2006 and 2009. Diary-derived indices of sleep and daytime functioning and the Insomnia Severity Index were compared for patients with primary insomnia (DSM-IV-TR criteria, n = 828) and for those with insomnia comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD, DSM-IV-TR criteria, n = 545), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, DSM-IV-TR criteria, n = 595), perimenopause/postmenopause (Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria, n = 410), and rheumatoid arthritis (American College of Rheumatology criteria, n = 153). Cohen d effect sizes were calculated for each individual study as the between-treatment difference score divided by the pooled standard deviation. Results: Effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.69 (small-medium) as early as week 1 and were maintained at 0.26-0.63 at week 4 for sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and total sleep time. Sleep latency and total sleep time effect sizes increased from week 1 to week 4 in the primary insomnia group. At week 4, effect sizes on all 3 parameters and the Insomnia Severity Index tended to be highest for the primary insomnia patients and tended to be lowest for patients with comorbid GAD and MDD. The effect sizes for daytime functioning were small for all insomnia patient groups. Conclusions: Eszopiclone 3 mg is an effective treatment for insomnia across 5 clinically diverse patient populations; however, magnitude of effect is mediated by underlying comorbidity and their treatments, with largest measures of effect seen in primary insomnia and lowest in MDD and GAD. These consistent results, and the fact that clinical trials were conducted in patients being treated as appropriate for their comorbid clinical conditions, support the results' real-world generalizability and utility to clinical practice. ¬© 2012 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc."

In this study pain was assessed daily, for 25 days, in 23 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients received placebo during the last 9 days of the study. Pain scores during the first 16 days acted as a baseline from which each patient's response to placebo could be determined. Patients completed Form B of the Eysenck Personality Inventory on entry into the study, a pre-treatment expectation rating scale and a post-treatment assessment scale. Five patients were excluded from analysis because of trends in their baseline pain scores. Of the remaining patients, nine responded positively to placebo and five responded negatively. Four patients reported no significant change in pain and were found to be more introverted than both the negative (p<0.05) and positive placebo responders. Consequently, the degree of extraversion might prove a useful predictor of therapeutic response. No significant relationship was found between the patients expectation of therapy and the observed response which suggests that therapeutic outcome is not pre-determined. However, the patients assessment of therapeutic effect was closely related to the observed response (p<0.05). Neuroticism was greater in patients with side-effects than those without (p<0.05) and might be utilized as a means of detecting those patients most likely to complain of unrelated symptoms while on a new therapy. The different placebo responses observed draws attention to the difficulties in making therapeutic judgements in clinical practice and of assessing efficacy in drug trials."
9739110,,10.1016/j.artres.2014.09.093,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with aortic stiffening, which can be reversed with immunomodulatory therapy. However, the mechanism by which infl ammation leads to aortic stiffening remains uncertain. One possible explanation is via endothelial dysfunction, which has also been demonstrated in RA and is resolved with anti-TNF-alpha therapy. However, there is no evidence to ascertain relationship between the two. We hypothesized that endothelial dysfunction is responsible for increased aortic stiffness in RA and tested this hypothesis by determining whether an improvement in endothelial function with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential co-factor for endothelial nitric oxide synthase, leads to a reduction of aortic stiffness. This was a randomized, double-blind crossover study, consisting of two separate regimes: 1) a single dose of BH4 400 mg and placebo and 2) a 1 week treatment with BH4 400 mg once daily and placebo. In study 1, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), as a measure of aortic stiffness and fl ow mediated dilatation (FMD), as a measure of endothelial function, were assessed. In study 2, patients made four visits to the unit, each separated by 1 week (baseline 1, treatment 1, baseline 2, treatment 2) and FMD and PWV were assessed at each visit. Data are presented as mean changes +/- SD, and significance was determined using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Eighteen RA patients completed study 1. A single dose of BH4 lead to an improvement of FMD response (+3.57 +/- 4.14%, P = 0.002), while the placebo had no effect (+0.05 +/- 1.17%, P = 0.9; between groups P = 0.001). There was no change in aortic PWV (-0.19 +/- 2.13 m s-1, P = 0.2). Ten RA patients completed study 2. One week treatment with BH4 improved endothelial function (+1.82 +/- 2.20%, P = 0.02) whereas placebo did not (-0.18 +/- 0.70%, P = 0.4; between groups P = 0.04). There was no change in aortic PWV (-0.18 +/- 0.70 m s-1, P = 0.4). There was no correlation between change in aortic PWV and FMD in either regime. This study shows for the first time that an improvement of endothelial function, without changing infl ammation or other cardiovascular risk factors, does not lead to an amelioration of aortic stiffness. This suggests that endothelial dysfunction is not the driving force behind aortic stiffening in RA and that these conditions may just exist in parallel, both infl uenced by common risk factors, such as infl ammation."

To compare the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tolerability of celecoxib (a cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor) and diclofenac using data from three randomised, double-blind clinical trials in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. Patients in two OA studies received either celecoxib 100 mg BID (n = 545), diclofenac 50 mg BID or TID (n = 540), or placebo (n = 200) for 6 weeks. In the RA study, patients received celecoxib 200 mg BID (n = 326) or diclofenac 75 mg BID (n = 329) for 24 weeks. The cumulative incidence of abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea or any of these events (UGI tolerability composite endpoint) after the first 6 weeks was estimated using time-to-event analysis. Results. In the pooled OA trials, the cumulative incidence of the composite endpoint was significantly higher with diclofenac (17.6%; 95% CI: 14.4 - 20.9%) than celecoxib (11.1%; 95% CI: 8.4 - 13.8%; p = 0.002) and comparable with placebo (13.3%; 95% CI: 8.1 - 18.4%; p = 0.157). In the RA trial, the cumulative incidence of the UGI tolerability composite endpoint was also significantly higher with diclofenac (20.7%; 95% CI: 16.3 - 25.1%) than celecoxib (15.9%; 95% CI: 11.9 - 20.0%; p = 0.013). Celecoxib was also better tolerated than diclofenac in this trial in terms of the cumulative incidences of abdominal pain (p = 0.031) and dyspepsia (p = 0.062). The results of the UGI tolerability composite endpoint analysis were confirmed using the Cox proportional hazards model to control for other predictors of UGI adverse events. Conclusion. The UGI tolerability of therapeutic dosages of celecoxib was significantly better than diclofenac in patients with RA or OA."

Radiological data show that Rituximab is capable of effectively arresting joint destruction. The treatment was well tolerated. The most common side effect, seen in up to 35% of patients, was infusion reactions, particularly during initial Rituximab administration.

The serious infection rate in this randomised trial was slightly increased compared with the placebo group, as would also be expected for other biologicals. Data on re-treatment is currently available for up to five treatments and show sustained and/or improved efficacy with continued good tolerance. ¬© 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag."

Despite low-dose glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, many patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) require additional flare therapy with GC at higher doses. Since low dose GC has been suggested to confer resistance to higher doses, we aimed to assess if resistance was detectable on the clinical level in patients with active RA. Methods. Eighty-nine patients with active RA (Disease Activity Score 28, DAS28 > 3.2, mean age 54.5 years, mean duration of RA 9.7 years) were consecutively enrolled into a one-week trial of a total of 250 mg prednisolone. We compared improvement of the DAS28 and the Simplified Disease Activity index (SDAI) in groups of patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 48) low-dose GC at baseline (by t-test). In addition, we analyzed changes of all individual core set measures of disease activity using multivariate statistics. Results. All clinical, serological and functional measures improved significantly over one week (p < 0.001). Baseline RA activity of patients with and without low-dose GC was on average +/- standard deviation similar among the two groups (DAS28: 4.8 +/- 1.2 and 4.9 +/- 1.1; mean SDAI: 26.1 +/- 14.0 and 25.9 +/- 13.0, respectively), and likewise there was no difference between the two groups in the final disease activity reached, for both the DAS28 (1.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 1.0; p = 0.14) and the SDAI (11.1 +/- 13.4 vs. 11.1 +/- 11.4; p = 0.99). Improvement in all individual measures was also not different using a multivariate model (p = 0.26). Conclusion. Pre-treatment with low-dose GC does not appear to portend GC resistance at least clinically, since the responsiveness to GC boosts is unaffected. ¬© Copyright Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2008."

The study included 40 patients with RA and 30 controls. Serum ADMA and homocysteine levels were measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography system. Patients with DAS 28 scores <= 3.2, and > 3.2 were allocated into lower and high/moderate disease activity groups, respectively. Additionally patients were divided into 2 groups as early RA (disease duration <= 2 years) and established RA (duration of the disease >= 2 years). Functional disability was evaluated using Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Radiographs were scored using the modified Larsen score. Serum ADMA level was significantly higher than controls (P=0.008) in RA patients, while homocysteine level was comparable (P=0.059). Serum ADMA and homocysteine levels did not correlate with clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). These outcomes demonstrate that ADMA and homocysteine levels cannot be used as a parameter for disease activity in RA.Copyright ¬© 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved."

To determine the efficacy, gastrointestinal safety, and tolerability of celecoxib (a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX 2) inhibitor) used in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Design. Systematic review of randomised trials that compared at least 12 weeks' celecoxib treatment with another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or placebo and reported efficacy, tolerability, or safety. Trials identified from manufacturer and by searching electronic databases and evaluated according to predefined inclusion and quality criteria. Data combined through meta-analysis. Participants. 15 187 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Main outcome measures. Efficacy: Western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index; American College of Rheumatology responder index and joint scores for rheumatoid arthritis. Tolerability: withdrawal rates for adverse effects. Gastrointestinal safety: incidence of ulcers, bleeds, perforations, and obstructions. Results. Nine randomised controlled trials were included. Celecoxib and NSAIDS were equally effective for all efficacy outcomes. Compared with those taking other NSAIDs, in patients taking celecoxib the rate of withdrawals due to adverse gastrointestinal events was 46% lower (95% confidence interval 29% to 58%; NNT 35 at three months), the incidence of ulcers detectable by endoscopy was 71% lower (59% to 79%; NNT 6 at three months), and the incidence of symptoms of ulcers, perforations, bleeds, and obstructions was 39% lower (4% to 61%; NNT 208 at six months). Subgroup analysis of patients taking aspirin showed that the incidence of ulcers detected by endoscopy was reduced by 51% (14% to 72%) in those given celecoxib compared with other NSAIDs. The reduction was greater (73%, 52% to 84%) in those not taking aspirin. Conclusion. Celecoxib is as effective as other NSAIDs for relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and has significantly improved gastrointestinal safety and tolerability."

It is associated with the fact that evaluation of their effectiveness is subjective in many respects. The most adequate method of studies of the effectiveness and side effects of nonsteroid agents in a clinic is a double blind test. The minimum of objective, simple and accessible criteria should be used in practical work, i.e. 1) articular index, 2) dynamometry of the hands, 3) walking at a distance of 30 m for time, 4) functional test according to Lee. Studies of the effectiveness of some antirheumatic agents under a double blind test (179 examinations in 137 patients with rheumatoid arthritis) demonstrated that a combination of aspirin with butadion and indometacin was mostly effective. However, these preparations produce the greatest number of side effects. Brufen is of small effectiveness but it possesses the best tolerability. The effect of mefenamic acid does not differ from that of placebo. Prolonged treatment with nonsteroid preparations is recommended in view of the fact that the risk of the disease progress and the negative effects of the rheumatoid process on the internal organs is higher than that of side effects."

Methods: The empirical investigation was based upon data from a randomised controlled trial of 488 adults with rheumatoid arthritis who had pain and dysfunction of the hands and/or wrists. Participants completed the EQ-5D, SF-12 and MHQ at baseline and at 4 and 12 months follow up. Acceptability was measured using completion rates over time; construct validity using the ""known groups"" approach, based on pain troublesomeness; convergent validity using spearman's rho correlation (P); reliability using internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha); interpretability using minimal important differences (MID); and responsiveness using effect sizes and standardised response means (SRM) stratified by level of self-rated improvement in hand and wrist function or level of self-rated benefit and satisfaction from trial treatments. Results: At baseline, the study population had a mean age of 62.4 years, a mean MHQ score of 52.1 and included 76% women. The EQ-5D (utility) had the highest completion rates across time points. All instruments discriminated between pre-specified groups based on pain troublesomeness. Convergent validity analysis indicated that the MHQ score correlated strongly with the EQ-5D (P = 0.65) and SF-6D (P = 0.63) utility scores. The MHQ was most responsive at detecting change in indicators of RA pain severity between baseline and 4 months, whilst minimal important differences varied considerably across PROMs. Conclusions: The instruments evaluated in this study displayed varying psychometric properties in the context of RA of the hand. The selection of a preferred instrument in evaluative studies should ultimately depend on the relative importance placed on individual psychometric properties and the importance placed on generation of health utilities for economic evaluation purposes.Copyright ¬© 2017 The Author(s)."
9739201,,10.4081/reumatismo.2004.1s.62,"Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is a naturally occurring IL-1 inhibitor, acting as a ""receptor antagonist"", which blocks IL-1 mediated signal transduction. In 1990 IL-1Ra was cloned and later on, a large numbers of studies led to disclosure of the crucial importance of the imbalance between IL-1 and IL-1Ra in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In 1991, almost 8 years after the initial isolation of IL-1, recombinant IL-1Ra (IL-1ra, Kineret) was introduced in clinical trials involving patients with RA. Between 2001 and 2002 IL-1ra was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and by the European Agency for the Evaluation of the Medicinal Products and in 2003 it was registered in Italy, too. In RA recombinant IL-1ra has been evaluated in 5 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving more than 2900 patients. Two of the trials involved the use of IL-1 ra as monotherapy versus placebo and two trials in combination with methotexate (MTX); the last trial explored the use of a fixed 100 mg/day IL-1 ra dosage in a RA patient population including a wide array of co-morbid conditions as well as concomitant medications. The studies confirmed both the efficacy and the safety of lL-1ra in patients with active and severe RA. 43% of patients receiving 150 mg/day IL-1ra achieved a 20% response according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20), compared to 27% in the placebo group. In the MTX combination therapy study, 42% of the patients receiving 1 mg/Kg/day of IL-1ra achieved an ACR20, 24% an ACR 50, and 10% an ACR70. In each study, significant improvements in the Health Assessment Questionnaire scores (HAQ) were observed. There were rapid gains in the number of days at work or domestic activity in the treated patients, and the increases in productivity were dose related. At early 24 weeks, there was significant reduction of both the score for progression of joint space narrowing (JSN) and the Total modified Sharp-Genant score (a combination of erosion and JSN) in all treatment groups (30, 75 and 150 mg/day). The clinical benefits of treatment with daily subcutaneous injections of IL-1ra in active RA patients were maintained for up to 48 weeks. IL-1ra, a selective inhibitor of the IL-1 pathway, represents an important new biologic approach to treating patients with RA, that significantly reduces clinical signs and symptoms of the disease and joint destruction and has proved safe and well tolerated also in combination with other DMARDs and concomitant medications."

9739212,,10.2188/jea.je20090030,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this review was to summarize findings on aquatic exercise and balneotherapy and to assess the quality of systematic reviews based on randomized controlled trials. METHODS: Studies were eligible if they were systematic reviews based on randomized clinical trials (with or without a meta-analysis) that included at least 1 treatment group that received aquatic exercise or balneotherapy. We searched the following databases: Cochrane Database Systematic Review, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, JDream II, and Ichushi-Web for articles published from the year 1990 to August 17, 2008. RESULTS: We found evidence that aquatic exercise had small but statistically significant effects on pain relief and related outcome measures of locomotor diseases (eg, arthritis, rheumatoid diseases, and low back pain). However, long-term effectiveness was unclear. Because evidence was lacking due to the poor methodological quality of balneotherapy studies, we were unable to make any conclusions on the effects of intervention. There were frequent flaws regarding the description of excluded RCTs and the assessment of publication bias in several trials. Two of the present authors independently assessed the quality of articles using the AMSTAR checklist. CONCLUSIONS: Aquatic exercise had a small but statistically significant short-term effect on locomotor diseases. However, the effectiveness of balneotherapy in curing disease or improving health remains unclear."

9739226,,10.3899/jrheum.091447,"Objective. We compared variations among Canadian provinces in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initiating anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Methods. Data were obtained from the Optimization of Humira trial (OH) and from the Ontario Biologics Research Initiative (OBRI). Baseline characteristics were compared between regions: Ontario (ON), Quebec (QC), and other provinces (OTH). We compared Ontario OH to OBRI patients who were initiating anti-TNF therapy. Results. In 300 OH patients, mean age was 54.8 years (13.3). There were 151 (50.3%) ON patients, 57 from QC (19%), and 92 from OTH (30.7%). Regional differences were seen in the number of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) ever taken (ON: 3.8 +/- 1.4, QC: 3.1 +/- 1.1, OTH: 3.3 +/- 1.4; p < 0.001); swollen joint count (SJC; ON: 10.9 +/- 5.9, QC: 9.0 +/- 4.4, OTH: 11.3 +/- 5.6; p = 0.033); tender joint count (TJC; ON: 12.2 +/- 7.5, QC: 10.3 +/- 5.7, OTH: 14.4 +/- 7.6; p = 0.003); 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28; ON: 5.8 +/- 1.2, QC: 5.6 +/- 1.0, OTH: 6.0 +/- 1.1; p = 0.076); and Health Assessment Questionnaire (ON: 1.4 +/- 0.7, QC: 1.7 +/- 0.7, OTH: 1.5 +/- 0.7; p = 0.060). DMARD-ever use differed: methotrexate (ON: 94.7%, QC: 93%, OTH: 84.8%; p = 0.025); leflunomide (ON: 74.8%, QC: 21.1%, OTH: 51.1%; p < 0.001); sulfasalazine (ON: 51%, QC: 38.6%, OTH: 25%; p < 0.001); myochrysine (ON: 9.3%, QC: 0%, OTH: 15.2%; p = 0.008); and hydroxychloroquine (ON: 67.5%, QC: 86%, OTH: 66.3%; p = 0.018). In comparison to ON OH patients, 95 OBRI patients initiating first anti-TNF had lower SJC (p = 0.017), TJC (p = 0.008), and DAS28 (p = 0.05). Conclusion. In Quebec, where access to anti-TNF is less restrictive, patients had lower SJC and TJC. ON used more DMARD, especially leflunomide, as mandated by the provincial government. Both provincial funding criteria and prescribing habits may contribute to differences. Canadian rheumatologists may vary in treatment decisions, but patients generally have similar DAS28 when initiating anti-TNF therapy. The Journal of Rheumatology Copyright ¬© 2010.

9739252,,10.1136/bmj.1.4873.1223,"In a controlled therapeutic trial prednisolone has been compared with acetylsalicylic acid or other analgesics in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Eight centres participated and 84 patients entered the trial. A few patients defaulted, died or were withdrawn from the trial, so that the results after 2 yr. of treatment are based on the analysis of 77 patients, of whom 41 were originally allocated to prednisolone and 36 to analgesics. The patients treated with prednisolone showed an early significant improvement in both clinical and laboratory indices of inflammatory polyarthritis and this improvement, though less, was still present to a significant extent at the end of 2 yr. In the group of patients treated with analgesics the frequency of radiological signs of erosive joint disease in the hands and feet increased significantly over the 2 yr., whereas there was no significant change in the group treated with prednisolone. In many patients treated with prednisolone the agglutinating titre in the sheep cell test rose during the 2 yr. of treatment, whereas such a rise occurred in only a few patients treated with analgesics. Two patients treated with analgesics died of heart failure. Five patients treated with prednisolone alone developed major complications (2 cases of psychosis and 3 of peptic ulcer). These major complications all occurred in patients receiving a daily dose of 20 mg. or more of prednisolone. Patients receiving prednisolone also gained weight, and showed some rise in blood pressure and a tendency to mooning of the face. During the trial the mean daily dose of prednisolone was gradually reduced from 17.4 to 10.0 mg. and more than half the patients on prednisolone were also receiving acetyl-salicylic acid or other analgesics. It is concluded that the optimal daily dose for long-term therapy in the average case of rheumatoid arthritis is not more than 10 mg."

9739264,,10.2196/resprot.3572,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 2.1% of the Australian population (1.5% males; 2.6% females), with the highest prevalence from ages 55 to over 75 years (4.4-6.1%). In Canada, RA affects approximately 0.9% of adults, and within 30 years that is expected to increase to 1.3%. With an aging population and a greater number of individuals with modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases, such as arthritis, there is an urgent need for co-care management of arthritic conditions. The increasing trend and present shifts in the health services and policy sectors suggest that digital information delivery is becoming more prominent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the use of online resources for RA information delivery., OBJECTIVE: The objective is to examine the effect of implementing an online program provided to patients with RA, the People Getting a Grip on Arthritis for RA (PGrip-RA) program, using information communication technologies (ie, Facebook and emails) in combination with arthritis health care professional support and electronic educational pamphlets. We believe this can serve as a useful and economical method of knowledge translation (KT)., METHODS: This KT randomized controlled trial will use a prospective randomized open-label blinded-endpoint design to compare four different intervention approaches of the PGrip-RA program to a control group receiving general electronic educational pamphlets self-management in RA via email. Depending on group allocation, links to the Arthritis Society PGrip-RA material will be provided either through Facebook or by email. One group will receive feedback online from trained health care professionals. The intervention period is 6 weeks. Participants will have access to the Internet-based material after the completion of the baseline questionnaires until the final follow-up questionnaire at 6 months. We will invite 396 patients from Canadian and Australian Arthritis Consumers' Associations to participate using online recruitment., RESULTS: This study will build on a pilot study using Facebook, which revealed promising effects of knowledge acquisition/integration of the evidence-based self-management PGrip educational program., CONCLUSIONS: The use of online techniques to disseminate knowledge provides an opportunity to reduce health care costs by facilitating self-management of people with arthritis. Study design strengths include the incorporation of randomization and allocation concealment to ensure internal validity. To avoid intergroup contamination, the Facebook group page security settings will be set to ""closed"", thus allowing only invited participants to access it.

The patients were divided at random into three groups (A, B, C) of 15 each. Group A was given basic therapy (calcium, dichlrophenac, nor-androstenolone) with addition of calcifediol. Group B received basic therapy plus calcitonine in paraphysiological doses. Group C was treated with basic therapy only (highly effective on its own). Observation and treatment were brief but able to provide useful indications regarding the implementation of longer courses of treatment (3-6 months). At the end of treatment, results were submitted to biometric control. With the aid of statistics it can thus be stated that alkaline phosphatase and hydroxyprolinuria fall in group B (basic treatment + calcitonine) and this suggests that the treatment causes some improvement in the exchangeable bone calcium pool. The values of these parameters also fall with the addition of calcifediol to basic therapy, but this fall is not very high. Pain symptomatology is also favourably affected, and to a statistically significant extent, by the three treatments: group A patients (basic + calcifediol) show greater improvement compared with straightforward basic therapy, but the best results are encountered in group B, treated with an association of basic and calcitonine.

Valdecoxib 1.25 to 10mg twice daily and valdecoxib 10mg once daily were more effective than placebo for the relief of pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, and dosages above 5mg twice daily were similar in efficacy to naproxen 500mg twice daily. Similarly, valdecoxib 5 and 10 mg/day were as effective for osteoarthritis of the hip as naproxen 500mg twice daily. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, valdecoxib 10, 20 or 40 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo, and similar in efficacy to naproxen 500mg twice daily; there were no significant differences in efficacy between the three dosages of valdecoxib. Valdecoxib 20 or 40mg administered 1 to 3 hours before and 12, 24 and 36 hours after hip arthroplasty provided significantly better analgesia than placebo, and significantly reduced the amount of morphine taken by patients.

In both groups the IgA and IgG levels remained unchanged; unter D-penicillamine, on the contrary, a statistically significant and continuous fall of IgM and caeruloplasmin was observed; prednisolone treatment induced only a temporary fall of caeruloplasmin. In the DPA treated patients, a significant correlation of IgM with caeruloplasmin and of caeruloplasmin with ESR was found. In both groups there was no correlation between joint count and caeruloplasmin, joint count and IgM, caeruloplasmin and copper, copper and ESR; in the prednisolone group no correlation between caeruloplasmin, ESR and IgM was observed. The correlations suggest that the remarkable fall of IgM and caeruloplasmin under D(-)penicillamine treatment is caused at least partially by direct interference of DPA with these plasma proteins."

Dose adjustments were performed according to tolerability and efficacy. With 168 patients eligible for evaluation the rate of withdrawal for any reason was 26% in group A and 27% in B. Withdrawal due to side effects occurred in 16% versus 18%, dose reduction due to side effects in 10% versus 9%. The higher dose was associated with a significantly higher rate of gastrointestinal side effects (28% vs. 17%, p < 0.05) and a tendency for more frequent elevations of transaminases. Other side effects were not dose dependent. A significantly higher rate of dose reduction due to improvement (35% versus 10%, p < 0.001), a more rapid decline of morning stiffness, and a higher number of patients reporting marked improvement are evidence in favour of higher therapeutic efficacy of the higher dose. In conclusion, an initial dose of 25 mg MTX/week is not associated with a higher rate of limiting side effects as compared with 15 mg/week. The efficacy of doses up to 25 mg/week should be examined in more detail."

9739340,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1953/v1,10.21203/rs.2.11027/v1,"Hip surgery is a common type of orthopedic surgery. The pathologies are complex, including chronic conditions such as femoral head necrosis, primary hip dysplasia, hip joint osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as acute diseases such as femoral neck fractures and intertrochanteric fractures. The surgical treatment includes closed reduction and internal fixation, open reduction and internal fixation, hemiarthroplasty (femoral head replacement), and total hip arthroplasty, etc. The population of patients undergoing hip surgery has a high proportion of elderly (>65 years old), with multiple preoperative comorbidities, and significant postoperative pain. We must achieve the balance between the providing sufficient analgesia and minimizing associated adverse reactions perioperatively for such group of patients, therefore promoting patients' rehabilitation.
 Sufentanil, a pure Œº receptor agonist with active metabolite, is a long-acting strong opioid which has high analgesic efficacy. It is commonly used in anesthesia practice, not only for intraoperative analgesia, but also postoperative pain relief, i.e. a popular drug of choice used for Patient Control Intravenous Analgesia (PCIA). However, sufentanil is associated with high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), respiratory depression and other adverse reactions, which could negatively affect the patient's analgesic satisfaction, and compromise the course of postoperative recovery. It is important to establish an effective and safe postoperative analgesic regime that can achieve the comparable analgesic efficacy with reduced incidence of adverse reactions. Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid which is extracted from the thebaine, it activates both Œº and Œ∫ opioid receptors. It has been reported to have good analgesic effect and lower incidence of adverse reactions such as PONV in comparison with Morphine, and could be a reasonable option for PCIA. As Oxycodone can agonize Œ∫ receptors and reduce visceral pain, most of the existing studies on Oxycodone are focused on laparoscopic cholecystectomy and other abdominal surgeries, with the average age of study patients is between 40 to 55 years old, and also lack of large sample studies.
 Based on the abovementioned literatures, we propose the hypothesis that in hip surgery, compared with Sufentanil PCIA, the equipotency dose of Oxycodone PCIA can achieve the same postoperative analgesic efficacy and may also reduce the incidence of adverse reactions associated with opioids."

 Subjects suffering from chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee will be recruited for this study, and randomly assigned to two groups. One-half of these Subjects (Group A) will receive ultrasound therapy as detailed below on the affected joint; the other half (Group B) is a placebo group. Assuming 60% of subjects in Group A show some improvement, as do 30% of patients in Group B, total enrolment of 84 patients (42 per group) will yield statistically significant results (p=0.05; 80% power).
 A Study Administrator will assign subjects to a treatment group randomly, and keep this information strictly confidential. Subjects and investigators will be blinded. The Study Administrator will assign each participant a randomly generated Patient ID number to be used in the collection of data.
 Subjects will provide in advance written consent to participate in the study, in accordance with Health Canada requirements. Participating subjects will provide baseline pain assessments prior to their first treatment using a 10-point Numeric Pain Scale. They will indicate their current level of pain, and the best and worst pain experienced in the previous 24 hours. An average of these three ratings will be noted. Additionally, participants will complete a Brief Pain Inventory, indicating the location(s) of their pain as well as its impact on general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life.
 Group A: the first patient group will receive ultrasound therapy on the affected knee joint, using the CPI-LIPUS Device (Circuit Plus Inc., Richmond Hill, Ontario). This low intensity pulsed ultrasonic system operates at 1 MHz for a fixed time of 5 minutes, with a pulsed repetition of 1 kHz. Its total acoustic power is 6.3 W 5%, equivalent to 1.2 W/cm2 acoustic intensity. (Complete technical specifications of and instructions for CPI-LIPUS are attached as Appendix I.) Ultrasound treatment will be pulsed at 50%.
 The head of device will be applied to the most painful area of the knee (typically the medial or lateral upper quadrant) for one cycle of five minutes using ultrasound conductive media providing rotating movements, applying only enough pressure to provide adequate coupling of treatment head and the treatment area.
 Group B: group B will be ""treated"" with an identical device whose ultrasound emitting capabilities has been nullified. This device appears to operate, including illumination of the operating light. The head of the device will be applied to the most painful area of the knee (typically the medial or lateral upper quadrant) for five minutes exactly in the same manner as the Group A.
 Treatment of all patients will take place at Toronto Poly Clinic, Toronto Ontario, a multi-disciplinary clinic focused on the treatment of chronic pain. Lead investigator Dr. Rod is their treating physician. Treatments will be repeated at an interval of seven days. A total of six treatments will be performed. Pain assessments will be conducted prior to each treatment, and at 14 days following the last treatment.
 Toronto Poly Clinic follows the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario practice regulations including confidentiality and privacy rules and regulations. Study materials will only have subject/patient ID number.
 Participating patients will have free access to their usual analgesic treatments throughout the study. A condition of participation in the trial is the patients' agreement to maintain their current analgesic regimen, without change in medication or dosage.
 Once a day, participating subjects will rate their joint pain and ease of use of the joint on 10-point Likert scales. They will also record any use of analgesic medication. These data will be noted in Patient Diaries, whose only identifier will be the Patient ID number for maintaining full confidentiality and privacy.
 Data from pain assessments, and from the Patient Diaries, will be analyzed to determine the impact of ultrasound therapy on chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee joint. Statistical significance will be assessed.
 Data safety: all study materials, diaries, assessments and clinical notes collectively called data will be kept in secure server of the clinic for electronic data or locked cabinet of a secure area in clinic for paper data documents."

To determine the safety and efficacy of piroxicam in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, 26 patients ranging in age from three to 25 years were randomly assigned to treatment with piroxicam or naproxen. The number of painful and swollen joints decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) in the piroxicam group. The overall assessment of the investigators was that 67% of the patients in the piroxicam group showed clinical improvement, in contrast to 38% of the naproxen-treated patients. Side effects in the piroxicam group were mild and transient, and no patient was removed from the study because of side effects. The recurrence of a cutaneous rash necessitated the removal of one naproxen-treated patient from the study.

Methods Pooled data were analysed from two similar phase III studies: SICCANOVE (moderate-to-severe DED) and SANSIKA (severe DED with severe keratitis). In both studies, patients aged ‚â•18 years received CsA CE 0.1% (n=395) or vehicle (n=339) once daily for 6 months. A composite responder efficacy endpoint (corneal fluorescein staining-Ocular Surface Disease Index (CFS-OSDI) at month 6) was used to evaluate the efficacy of CsA CE in alleviating signs/symptoms of DED (response defined as improvement of ‚â•2 grades in CFS and ‚â•30% in OSDI (baseline to month 6)). Human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) conjunctival expression was used as a biomarker of ocular surface inflammation.

We present a radiolabelling method for certolizumab pegol (CZP), a commercially available humanized Fab‚Ä≤-fragment directed against TNF. A biodistribution and dosimetry study was conducted. Tc-S-HYNIC CZP was synthesized. The in vitro TNF neutralizing activity was tested by exposing L929s-cells to various concentrations 99mTc-S-HYNIC CZP and measuring TNF-induced cytotoxicity. For biodistribution and dosimetry, WB images and blood and urine sampling were performed up to 24¬†h pi. Cumulative activities were estimated using mono-exponential fitting, and organ doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM. The effective dose was calculated using the International Commission on Radiological Protection 103 recommendations. The uptake of the tracer in the peripheral joints was assessed visually and semiquantitatively. Results: in vitro tests showed blocking of TNF cytotoxicity by the 99mTc-S-HYNIC CZP formulation comparable to the effect obtained with the unlabelled CZP with or without the HYNIC linker. We analysed eight patients with rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthritis. The highest mean absorbed organ doses were recorded for kidneys, spleen, and liver: 56 (SD 7), 34 (SD 6), and 33 (SD 7) ŒºGy/MBq. The effective dose was 6.1 (SD 0.9) mSv for a mean injected activity of 690 (SD 35) MBq. The urinary excretion was 15.1% (SD 8.1) of the IA at 22.5¬†h. Blood analysis yielded a distribution half-life of 1.2¬†h (SD 1.5) and an elimination half-life of 26.9¬†h (SD 2.7). Visual analysis of the scans revealed marked tracer accumulation in the clinically affected peripheral joints. In addition, there was a statistically significant higher uptake of the tracer in the swollen joints (median uptake ratio compared to background of 3.3 in rheumatoid arthritis and 2.4 in peripheral spondyloarthritis) compared to clinically negative joints (respectively 1.3 and 1.6). Conclusions: we present a radiolabelling technique for CZP, a Fab‚Ä≤-fragment directed against TNF and currently used as a therapeutic agent in rheumatology. An effective dose of 6.1¬†mSv (SD 0.9) was estimated. We confirmed the uptake of this new radiopharmaceutical in clinically affected peripheral joints"

9739446,,10.54615/2231-7805.10.02.11,"Background: rheumatoid factor (RF) is an IgM antibody against the Fc portion of IgG, which together form an immune complex. RF is an important criterion in the diagnosis of early-stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and prognosis of RA pathogenesis, as higher levels of RF indicate a higher possibility of more damage. Although 2/3 to 3/4 of patients that undergo ordinary standard tests and have final clinical diagnosis are also positive for RF, a 70-90% prevalence of RF among RA patients can be achieved, depending on the method of detection and the target antibody, IgG or IgM. In this study, we measured the frequency of IgG and IgM RF isotypes using the ELISA and latex agglutination methods and compare these results with those of a hospital control group, tested using standard methods, in order to determine the best method for the measurement of RF. Methods: of the patients referred to the Rheumatology Clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital during 2005-2006, one hundred randomly selected rheumatoid arthritis patients, 75 females and 25 males, with classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis (defined by the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology), with a short disease duration of 12-24 months, underwent testing for RF using the latex method for IgM and ELISA for IgM-IgG. The healthy control group (75 females and 25 males) were tested for RF using the ELISA method for IgM-IgG. The variables were compared using the Pearson's chi-square test. Results: we found that the measurement of RF among RA patients using did not differ significantly between the two methods. The immune complex in RA is mainly IgM. The positive IgM results in RF patients using two similar methods showed a significant relationship by Pearson's correlation co-efficient (r=0.60, p<0.001). In addition, comparison of the IgM and IgG RF by ELISA showed a weak correlation with low significance (r=0.10, p<0.001). In sum, this study showed a significant difference (r=0.24, p<0.001) between the IgM in RA patients and that in healthy people, who had no IgM or IgG RF. Conclusion: approximately 75% of confirmed RA cases had the IgM RF; however, we found little advantage in using the one method over the other, nor was the measurement of IgG more useful than IgM as a diagnostic criteria"

Primary Outcome: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in quality of life (QOL) (increase in European QOL-5- Dimension-3-Level Singapore (EQ5D-SG)index by 0.1) at 6 months. Secondary Outcomes: Change in EQ5D-SG, pain, disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), physical function (modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, mHAQ), coping, self-efficacy (Rheumatoid Arthritis Self-Efficacy scale, RASE), Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS), Disease Specific Knowledge (DSK) and physical activity. Adult patients with RA were randomly assigned to a single visit to a 6-member MDT (rheumatologist, nurse, medical social worker, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and podiatrist) or usual care. MDT providers prescribed disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) and counselled patients with respect to managing flares, medication adherence, coping, joint protection, exercise, footwear. Data were collected by face-to-face questionnaires, review of medical records and joint counts by a standardised blinded assessor at 0, 3 and 6 months.

The purpose of this study is to develop a Global Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (G-PROM) to quantify and compare the distribution of patients' overall experiences on medications. Method(s): We invited rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who were part of an online community to complete a survey, based on Trajectory Mapping (TM) to generate a hierarchy of AEs. The TM survey establishes a hierarchy by enabling patients to indicate whether an AE is worse, better, or no better or worse than a referent AE. TM allows the construction of ""equivalence classes"" i.e., groups of AEs judged by patients as having a comparable impact on quality of life. We subsequently conducted a second survey in which participants (who did not participate in the initial TM survey) were asked to indicate their preference for pairs of outcomes, where each outcome include both a specified level of benefit [little or no improvement (ACR20 or less), some improvement (between ACR20 and 50), and major improvement (ACR50 and greater)]and an AE (see Figure 1). Result(s): 195 participants completed the initial TM survey. The mean age was 53.5 (11.6), 89% were female, and 56% were college graduates. The initial TM survey generated 11 hierarchies of AEs. The final hierarchy (9 levels of AEs ranging from no AEs to serious AEs resulting in irreversible harm) was chosen based on goodness of fit parameters (see Figure 2). 426 participants with similar demographic characteristics completed the second survey. Ratings revealed that when paired with benefits, AEs clustered into 3 main groups: no, mild or manageable AEs (Levels 1-4), moderate AEs (Levels 5-6), and serious AEs (Levels 7-9). Participants' ratings generated a 5-level hierarchy of global outcomes illustrated in Figure 3. Conclusion(s): After validation, G-PROM will enable randomized controlled trials to report the percentage of patients classified into each level; thus, providing patients and their rheumatologists with a much clearer understanding of the range and likelihood of the total effects of competing treatment options on their quality of life.

In this work, we assessed ISP associated with a new formulation of etanercept compared to the prior formulation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriaticarthritis (PsA). Method(s): This phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study (NCT02986139) enrolled etanercept-naive patients with RA or PsA (inclusion based on the Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis [CASPAR criteria]). The 2-week treatment period was followed by a 30-day safety follow-up. Patients were randomized 1:1 to prior formulation first followed by new formulation or new formulation first followed by prior formulation; administered 1 week apart, consistent with labeled dosing (50mg weekly). ISP was assessed within 30 seconds after administration and was measured using a validated ISP scale based on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 mm (no pain at all) to 100 mm (worst pain imaginable). Result(s): Of 111 patients enrolled (56 prior 77.5%/new sequence; 55 new/prior sequence), 77.5% had RA, 22.5% had PsA. Of these, 104 patients received both doses. Overall, the mean change (least squares mean; 95% confidence interval [CI]) in ISP between prior and new formulations was 4.0 mm (0.03, 7.98) (Table). Patients with higher ISP scores from the prior formulation (by quartile cut points) had greater ISP improvements with the new formulation (Table, Figure). The reduction in ISP(95% CI) for those with prior formulation ISP scores above the arithmetic mean(23.6 mm) was 12.2 mm (3.1, 21.3) and for those below the mean was -0.9 mm(-3.9, 2.1). Injection site reactions were few in number and similar between formulations. Conclusion(s): The new formulation of etanercept was associated with lower mean ISP compared to the prior formulation. Patients with higher levels of pain with the prior formulation showed greater pain reduction with the new formulation."

The Research Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University approved this study. The study was conducted between May 2013 and April 2014.
 Participants A sample of thirty pregnant women were recruited from the Obstetric Out-patient Clinic, El-Sahel Teaching Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. To be included in the study, the participants were chosen pregnant women at early of the third trimester complaining from idiopathic CTS (pain, numbness and tingling of the hand), which was confirmed by electrophysiological examination (i.e. delayed median DML < 3.9 msec) as well as positive Phalen's test. Pregnant women having bilateral and unilateral CTS affection participated but the dominant hand data only were enrolled in this study. Their ages ranged from 25 to 35 years old, their body mass index (BMI) did not exceed 34 Kg/m2 and their gravidity number ranged from 1 to 3 times. The participants were excluded if they had other predisposing causes for CTS and/or neuromuscular diseases that might affect median nerve transmission such as diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis, previous CTS symptoms, acute hand trauma, cervical spondylosis, previous surgeries in the forearm involving the median nerve, peripheral neuropathy and pronator teres syndrome. All pregnant women did not receive any physical or medical therapy for treating CTS complains and had no serious medical problems as pacemaker and heart diseases that might interfere with electrophysiological testing.
 Randomization Informed consent was signed by each participant after explaining the nature, purpose, and benefits of the study, informing them of their right to refuse or withdraw at any time, and about the confidentiality of any obtained data. The pregnant women were randomly assigned into two equal groups (control group and study group), a computer-based randomization program. No dropping out of subjects from the study after randomization.
 Interventions Participants were randomly assigned into; Control group composed of fifteen pregnant women who only wore a natural wrist splint during sleeping for 4 weeks. Study group composed of fifteen pregnant women who received a myofascial release in addition to wearing a natural wrist splint during sleeping for 4 weeks.
 Neutral wrist splint A neutral wrist splint was worn by all pregnant women in both groups daily at night, only all through the study time (4 weeks). This neutral wrist splint was used to keep the wrist in a straight position (neutral position) and to prevent the extreme wrist motion (flexion and extension) while sleeping.
 Myofascial release technique
 Each pregnant woman in the study group received myofascial release technique, 3 sessions/week for 4 weeks. The position of treatment was long sitting with the back fully supported, the dominant palm and forearm exposed and rested comfortably. Myofascial release technique was divided into two parts: -  First part; Myofascial wrist retinaculum (Transverse carpal ligament) release: the      physical therapist placed her fourth and fifth fingers of both hands between the      pregnant woman's fourth and fifth fingers and first and second fingers of the palmar      surface and extension of the pregnant woman's wrist was introduced. The Physical      therapist's thumbs overlie the lateral and medial attachments of the wrist flexor      retinaculum and transverse distraction to the retinaculum was applied until relaxation      of the soft tissue or release of the restriction was achieved (for about 30 seconds)      then relaxation time was about 10 seconds. 15 repetitions were made in each session,      three sessions per week for four weeks.
   -  Second part; Interosseous membrane and forearm muscles myofascial release (Bilateral      thumb pressure technique): gentle force was applied ventrally on the forearm through 2      hands grasping the pregnant woman's distal forearm with the thumbs contacting the      anterior aspect of the forearm muscles and interosseous membrane while the index fingers      grasping the posterior aspect of the forearm to engage the soft tissues cephalad until a      barrier of tissue motion was reached and hold for about 30 seconds then relaxation time      was about 10 seconds. 15 repetitions were made in each session, three sessions per week      for four weeks Outcome Measures
 Median nerve DML: it was done for all the pregnant women in both groups before participation in this study to confirm their diagnosis of CTS and also after the end of the treatment.
 Each pregnant woman in both groups was asked to evacuate her bladder to be more relaxed and then she was informed about the aim and steps of the test while she was seated on a wooden chair and her back was supported. The dominant forearm was in supinated position, rested on the examining table and the elbow joint held slightly flexed. The pregnant woman's body temperature was measured with an oral mercury thermometer and if it was normal, the test procedure was carried out and also the room temperature was adjusted at 22 ¬∞C, which controlled by an air conditioner as median nerve DML could be affected by the pregnant woman temperature as well as the room temperature.
 Before electrode placement, the areas used for recording, stimulating or ground points were cleaned by alcohol to clean the skin to decrease its resistance. Further reduction of impedance was obtained by using conducting gel on the surface of the recording electrodes.
 Then, the electromyography was calibrated and the parameters of the apparatus were adjusted as follows: time base at 5.0 milliseconds/division, the sensitivity at 4000.0 volts/division and the intensity according to the site of stimulation; it was about 7 mA at the wrist stimulation and 12 mA for the elbow stimulation [7].
 After the end of the previous preparation, the active recording electrode was placed on the motor point of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle and the reference recording electrode on the tip of the thumb. They were fixed to the hand by adhesive plaster straps. The bipolar stimulating electrode was placed above the wrist joint between the tendons of palmaris longus and the flexor carpi radialis muscles on the course of the median nerve, with the negative pole distal toward the active recording electrode, and the positive pole proximal to stimulate the median nerve. The ground electrode was placed on the distal wrist crease midway between the stimulating and recording electrodes, 7 mA was used at wrist stimulation.
 Then, the bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in the cubital fossa, just medial to the biceps tendon, with the negative pole distal toward the active recording electrode, and the positive pole proximal. The recording electrodes were applied at the same locations as in recording at wrist level. 12 mA was used at elbow stimulation.
 BCTQ: it was self-applied and evaluated the severity of symptoms and the functional status of patients with CTS. It had comprehensive framework, good validity, reliability and responsiveness in the hands of the researchers [8]. The questionnaire compromised two scales, a symptoms severity scale (SSS) and a functional status scale (FSS). The SSS evaluated symptoms regarding severity, frequency and time. The FSS evaluated how the syndrome affects daily life. Questions concerning SSS composed of 11 questions addressing: pain intensity during day time and night time, time of pain during the day, dormancy, weakness, tingling sensation at night, frequency of that night tingling sensation and skill. Each question had five answers numbered from 0 point (no symptoms) to 4 points (most severe). Questions concerning FSS consisted of daily activities that were performed by most individuals and were commonly affected by CTS. The patients rated their ability to perform the activity on a scale that ranged from 1 point (no difficulty with the activity) to 5 points (cannot perform the activity at all). The overall score for the FSS was the mean of the ratings on the daily activities. This questionnaire was performed before and after treatment for both groups."

The disease over the course of time, leads to joint deformity and disability. The disease ranks third as major cause of disability after osteoarthritis and gout and affects roughly 1% of global population. Decrease mobility in patients results in decreased productivity and further worsens their quality of life. While pharmacological treatment may be essential in managing the acute flares and episodic pain associated with the disease, self-care and home-based management of RA is another important area of care which patients need to incorporate to manage it effectively.
 Several studies have reported that self-care in RA effectively reduces acute flares. This could be done through the use of patient education and counselling. Pharmacist provide pharmaceutical care that incorporates these areas of care. Pharmaceutical care is an individualized patient-centric health service delivered by pharmacists that incorporates, but is not limited to, disease education, therapy management, self-care and self-management of disease and therapy as well as motivational guidance.
 Evidence from several randomized trials indicate that patient counselling, disease education and telephonic interventions have improved self-care practices of patients. Educating patients about managing RA empowers them in understanding signs and symptoms of disease and devise ways to reduce or limit aggravating factors. A randomized trial conducted by Petkova that involved community pharmacy-based patient education program improved treatment outcomes of arthritis patients. Moreover, Mary and colleagues demonstrated positive effect of mobile phone short message service on medication adherence of patients with RA.
 In the last decade there has been only few studies that have evaluated the impact of pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care on treatment outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In Pakistan, no study has been conducted till date that evaluates the same. Since, the disease prevalence has increased in Pakistani population of late, and mainly affects the middle-aged individuals, it is expected to affect their productivity, employ-ability and income. This would worsen their health-related quality of life and adds to economic burden of this disease on the society. Therefore, a need was felt to evaluate the impact of pharmacist-delivered pharmaceutical care on treatment outcomes in Pakistani patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

A multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted between March 2012 and July 2014 at ten Chinese hospitals. In total, 320 pSS patients-classified according to the 2002 American-European Consensus Group Criteria-were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive TGP(600 mg, tid) in the TGP group or placebo for 24 weeks in the placebo group. Study personnel, investigators, and patients were blinded to the treatment grouping. The primary endpoint was the improvement of EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) at week 24. The secondary endpoints were dry eyes/mouth/skin/nose/throat/vagina visual analogue scale (VAS), pain and discomfort VAS, fatigue VAS, mental discomfort VAS, patient global assessment (PGA), EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), Schirmer's test, basal/stimulated salivary flow-rate values, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). All adverse events were recorded during the trial period. ESSPRI improved more in the TGP than the placebo group (p < 0.001). Dry eyes/throat/vagina VAS, fatigue VAS, mental discomfort VAS, PGA, Schirmer's test, and ESR also improved more in the TGP group than in the placebo group (all p < 0.05). Stimulated salivary flow-rate values increased in the TGP group at week 12 but not at week 24. Adverse events in TGP group were 10.9%. TGP can alleviate some dryness symptoms as well as disease activity in pSS patients over 24 weeks. TGP was well tolerated by study subjects. TGP seems to be an effective and safe treatment for pSS.Copyright ¬© 2018, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR)."

9739590,,10.3899/jrheum.100866,"Purpose of Study: the present randomized controlled study addressed whether sonographic needle guidance affected the outcomes of intraarticular injection for inflammatory arthritis. Methods Used: 244 symptomatic joints (3% small, 51% intermediate, and 46% large joints) with inflammatory arthritis (76% rheumatoid arthritis) were-randomized to injection by conventional palpation-guided anatomic injection (120 joints) or sonographic image-guided injection enhanced with a-one-handed RPD (the reciprocating procedure device) mechanical syringe (124 joints). A one needle, two-syringe technique was used. After intraarticular placement and synovial space dilation were confirmed by sonography, a syringe exchange was performed, and triamcinolone acetonide was injected with the second syringe through the indwelling intraarticular needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, pain at outcome (2 weeks and 6 months), responders, therapeutic duration, reinjection rates, total cost, and cost per responder were determined. Summary of Results: relative to conventional palpation-guided methods, sonographic guidance for injection of inflammatory arthritis resulted in 81% reduction in injection pain (p<0.001), a 35% reduction in pain scores at outcome (p<0.02), 38% increase in the responder rate (p<0.003), 34% reduction in the non-responder rate (p<0.003), a 32% increase in therapeutic duration (p =0.01), a 8% reduction ($7) in cost/patient/year, and a 33% ($64) reduction in cost/responder/year for a hospital outpatient (p<0.001). Conclusions: sonographic needle guidance improves the performance, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of intraarticular injections of inflammatory arthritis. (Figure Presented)"

In addition to a reduction of pain and improved function, serially applied mud baths lead to a reduction in the inflammatory processes, which often underlie degenerative and inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Objective: this study investigated the effects of serial mud baths on parameters of functional health, on pain perception and at the molecular level in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and degenerative alterations, e.g. gonarthritis and/or coxarthritis. Material and methods: a total of 41 patients with inflammatory rheumatic (33 RA and 8 AS) and 40 patients with degenerative diseases were subdived into 2 groups by computer-assisted randomization. In each group a subgroup received 9 serial mud baths within 21 days in addition to a multimodal physical rehabilitative complex treatment (intervention groups). In the other subgroups only the physical rehabilitative treatment was carried out and no mud baths were administered (control group). The outcome parameters were assessment of the functional capacity and pain perception (HAQ, FFbH, VAS and WOMAC), diesease activity (DAS28 and BASDAI) as well as laboratory markers of inflammatory activity (CRP, BSG, IL-1 beta and IL-10) and the patient assessment. Results: in the intervention groups after serial mud baths there was a significant improvement in the functional parameters (HAQ and FFbH, both p‚ÄØ< 0.01) and a significant reduction in pain strength (VAS, p‚ÄØ< 0.01) persisting for 3 months after the end of treatment. A significant reduction in disease activity (RA in DAS28 and AS in BASDAI) could be shown for the intervention groups as well as the control groups, whereby the effect strength was more pronounced in the intervention groups. In patients with gonarthritis and/or coxarthritis a significant improvement in functional limitations (WOMAC, p‚ÄØ< 0.01) was only found in the intervention groups. A significant improvement in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta (p‚ÄØ< 0.01) was only found in the intervention groups with a simultaneous increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (p‚ÄØ< 0.01). The CRP and BSG remained within the normal range and showed no significant changes even after serial mud baths. Conclusion: mud baths applied within the framework of a physical rehabilitative complex treatment brought about an improvement of parameters of functional health for both inflammatory rheumatic and degenerative diseases.

Efficacy endpoints included Disease Activity Score 28-joint count (DAS28) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and safety were also assessed., RESULTS: Of 372 patients randomized to the study drug, 330 (88.7%) completed the second treatment course. Mean change from baseline to week 48 in DAS28-C-reactive protein was comparable in the CT-P10 and combined rituximab (US-RTX and EU-RTX) groups (- 2.7 and - 2.6, respectively). ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates at week 48 indicated no differences between groups (80.6%, 55.4%, and 31.7% vs. 79.8%, 53.9%, and 33.7% in the CT-P10 and combined rituximab groups, respectively). Similar improvements in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index and all medical outcomes in the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, including physical and mental health, were seen in all groups. At week 48, antidrug antibodies were detected in 4.9%, 9.4%, and 8.6% of patients in the CT-P10, US-RTX, and EU-RTX groups, respectively. CT-P10 and rituximab displayed similar pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles., CONCLUSION: CT-P10 was similar to EU-RTX and US-RTX in terms of efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and safety up to week 48.

MCAF5352A is a humanized monoclonal antibody which targets both IL-17A and IL-17F, thereby inhibiting the activity of IL-17 dimers (IL-17AA, IL-17AF, and IL-17FF). The pharmacokinetic profile of MCAF5352A has been characterized in both a Phase Ia single ascending dose study and a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study. Two qualified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure total IL-17AA and IL-17FF levels in serum as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the Phase I studies. The two assays demonstrated specificity for IL-17AA or IL-17FF with sensitivity at low picogram/milliliter levels. The assay precision and accuracy also met acceptance criteria. Although total serum IL-17AA and IL-17FF levels were below the assay detection limits prior to administration of MCAF5352A, post-treatment levels in both the single and multiple dose cohorts became detectable and increased in a dose-dependent manner. These data are consistent with target engagement by MCAF5352A. Our work highlights bioanalytical challenges encountered while developing biomarker assays requiring high sensitivity and specificity. Data generated using these assays enabled the confirmation of target engagement during early clinical drug development."

 Study Design for Base Study: in the base study, ~178 subjects will be randomized to treatment with MK-8457 100 mg twice a day (oral tablet) or placebo for a total of 24 weeks.  Subjects are required to be on background methotrexate (MTX) therapy at stable doses prior to and during the study.
 Subjects will continue in a safety extension at the end of the base study.  After approximately ~50% of subjects have completed 12 weeks of treatment in the base study, an interim analysis (IA) will be conducted to evaluate for futility. While the IA is being conducted, enrollment will continue. A second IA will be performed to assess for efficacy after ~100% of subjects complete 12 weeks of treatment (or otherwise discontinue).  If efficacy is not demonstrated, the study may be discontinued.
 Early Escape: subjects in the base study will be eligible for early escape at Week 12 or any point after, if they demonstrate a <20% improvement in both tender and swollen joint counts.  Subjects may choose to either withdraw from the study or to continue into the safety extension portion of the study and receive MK-8457 100 mg twice a day (oral tablet) for up to a total of 100 weeks of treatment.

In the study, 120 hospitalized patients with SLE from the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology of the Peking University People's Hospital were randomly selected as the control (plain) group. The major organ involvement, clinical and immunological characteristics were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: The female to male ratio of Tibet plateau group was 10.7, while the corresponding ratio of plain group was 11.0. The mean age at disease diagnosis was (32.21+/-11.40) and (35.38+/-13.25) years, respectively. the most common initial manifestations of SLE were arthritis (78.6%), alopecia (55.7%) and malar rash (48.6%) in Tibet plateau group, the prevalence of arthritis and alopecia was significantly higher than in plain group (P<0.05). The incidence of neuropsychiatric and kidney involvement was significantly lower in Tibet plateau group compared with plain group (P<0.05). As for the serological manifestations, the positivity of anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (57.1%), anti-Smith (Sm) antibody (55.7%), anti-Sjogren syndrome A (SSA) antibody (72.3%), anti-Sjogren syndrome B (SSB) antibody (41.4%) and anti-u1-ribosenuclear protein (u1RNP) antibody (45.7%) was significantly higher in Tibet plateau group (P<0.05). While the incidence of low serum complement C3 (61.4%), C4 (38.6%) less frequent in Tibet plateau group. Mean SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score was similar in the Tibet plateau group (12.18+/-5.58) and plain group (12.69+/-7.28). Moreover, there were 13 (18.6%) SLE patients suffering from tuberculosis and 7 (10%) SLE patients infected with hepatitis B virus in Tibet plateau group. The number of recent-onset SLE patients with lower 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OH-VD3) in Tibet plateau group was fewer than that in the plain group (76.7% vs. 90.0%, P=0.046). Serum 25-OH-VD3 levels in Tibet plateau plateau group were (31.14+/-18.74) nmol/L, those in plain group were (26.91+/-14.27) nmol/L, and the difference was not significant., CONCLUSION: The age, gender and SLEDAI scores in Tibet plateau group was similar to those in plain group. But there are significant differences in clinical manifestations, distributions of antibodies and immunological changes between Tibet plateau group and plain group. The patients with lower serum 25-OH-VD3 levels were more in plain group than in Tibet plateau group, while there was no significant difference in the 25-OH-VD3 level between the two groups."
