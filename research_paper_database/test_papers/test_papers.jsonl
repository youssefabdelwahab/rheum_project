Usually made of nylon and elastane (i.e. Lycra®), these\narthritis gloves apply pressure with theaims of relieving hand pain, stiffness and improving hand function.\nHowever, a systematic review identified little evidence supporting their use. We therefore designed a trial to\ncompare the effectiveness ofthecommonest type ofarthritis glove provided in theUnited Kingdom (Isotoner\ngloves) (intervention) with placebo (control)gloves (i.e. larger arthritis gloves providing similar warmthto the\nintervention gloves but minimal pressure only) inpeople with these conditions.\nMethods: Participantsaged18yearsandoverwithRAorIAandpersistenthandpainwillberecruitedfromNational\nHealthServiceTrustsintheUnitedKingdom.Followingconsent,participantswillcompleteaquestionnairebooklet,then\nberandomlyallocatedtoreceiveinterventionorplaceboarthritisgloves.Withinthreeweeks,theywillbefittedwiththe\nallocatedglovesbyclinicalspecialistrheumatologyoccupationaltherapists.Twelveweeks(i.e.theprimaryendpoint)after\ncompletingthebaselinequestionnaire,participantswillcompleteasecondquestionnaire,includingthesamemeasures\nplusadditionalquestionstoexploreadherence,benefitsandproblemswithglove-wear.Asub-sampleofparticipants\nfromeachgroupwillbeinterviewedattheendoftheirparticipationtoexploretheirviewsoftheglovesreceived.The\nclinicaleffectivenessandcost-effectivenessoftheintervention,comparedtoplacebogloves,willbeevaluatedover\n12weeks.Theprimaryoutcomemeasureishandpainduringactivity.Qualitativeinterviewswillbethematicallyanalysed.\nDiscussion:Thisstudywillevaluatethecommonesttypeofarthritisglove(Isotoner)providedintheNHS(i.e.the\nintervention)comparedtoaplaceboglove.Theresultswillhelpoccupationaltherapists,occupationaltherapyservices\nandpeoplewitharthritismakeinformedchoicesastothevalueofarthritisgloves.Ifeffective,arthritisglovesshould\nbecomemorewidelyavailableintheNHStohelppeoplewithRAandIAmanagehandsymptomsandimprove\nperformanceofdailyactivities,workandleisure.Ifnot,servicescandeterminewhethertoceasesupplyingtheseto\nreduceservicecosts.\nTrialregistration:ISRCTNRegistry:ISRCTN25892131Registered05/09/2016\nKeywords:Arthritisgloves,Rheumatoidarthritis,Inflammatoryarthritis,Occupationaltherapy,Handpain,Handstiffness,\nHandswelling,Compressiongloves,Splints\n*Correspondence:a.hammond@salford.ac.uk\n1CentreforHealthSciencesResearch(OT),UniversityofSalford,Frederick\nRoad,L701AllertonBuilding,Salford,GreaterManchesterM66PU,UK\nFulllistofauthorinformationisavailableattheendofthearticle\n©TheAuthor(s).2017OpenAccessThisarticleisdistributedunderthetermsoftheCreativeCommonsAttribution4.0\nInternationalLicense(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/),whichpermitsunrestricteduse,distribution,and\nreproductioninanymedium,providedyougiveappropriatecredittotheoriginalauthor(s)andthesource,providealinkto\ntheCreativeCommonslicense,andindicateifchangesweremade.TheCreativeCommonsPublicDomainDedicationwaiver\n(http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)appliestothedatamadeavailableinthisarticle,unlessotherwisestated.\nPrioretal.BMCMusculoskeletalDisorders (2017) 18:224 Page2of15\nBackground consider this is between 15-32 mmHg.

It\ndoes not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the\npublic. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the\napplicable statutes and regulations.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis guidance provides recommendations to sponsors and applicants who intend, either before or after\napproval, to use equivalence criteria in analyzing in vivo or in vitro bioequivalence (BE) studies for\ninvestigational new drug applications (INDs), new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug\napplications (ANDAs) and supplements to these applications. This guidance discusses three\napproaches for BE comparisons: average, population, and individual. The guidance focuses on how to\nuse each approach once a specific approach has been chosen. This guidance replaces a prior FDA\nguidance entitled Statistical Procedures for Bioequivalence Studies Using a Standard Two-\nTreatment Crossover Design, which was issued in July 1992.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. General\nRequirements for submitting bioavailability (BA) and BE data in NDAs, ANDAs, and\nsupplements, the definitions of BA and BE, and the types of in vivo studies that are appropriate\nto measure BA and establish BE are set forth in 21 CFR part 320. This guidance provides\nrecommendations on how to meet provisions of part 320 for all drug products.\nDefined as relative BA, BE involves comparison between a test (T) and reference (R) drug\nproduct, where T and R can vary, depending on the comparison to be performed (e.g., to-be-\nmarketed dosage form versus clinical trial material, generic drug versus reference listed drug,\n1\nThis guidance has been prepared by the Population and Individual Bioequivalence Working Group of the\nBiopharmaceutics Coordinating Committee in the Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and\nResearch (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nJ:\\!GUIDANC\\3616fnl.doc\n01/31/01\ndrug product changed after approval versus drug product before the change). Although BA\nand BE are closely related, BE comparisons normally rely on (1) a criterion, (2) a confidence\ninterval for the criterion, and (3) a predetermined BE limit. BE comparisons could also be used\nin certain pharmaceutical product line extensions, such as additional strengths, new dosage\nforms (e.g., changes from immediate release to extended release), and new routes of\nadministration. In these settings, the approaches described in this guidance can be used to\ndetermine BE. The general approaches discussed in this guidance may also be useful when\nassessing pharmaceutical equivalence or performing equivalence comparisons in clinical\npharmacology studies and other areas.\nB. Statistical\nIn the July 1992 guidance on Statistical Procedures for Bioequivalence Studies Using a\nStandard Two-Treatment Crossover Design (the 1992 guidance), CDER recommended that\na standard in vivo BE study design be based on the administration of either single or multiple\ndoses of the T and R products to healthy subjects on separate occasions, with random\nassignment to the two possible sequences of drug product administration. The 1992 guidance\nfurther recommended that statistical analysis for pharmacokinetic measures, such as area under\nthe curve (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax), be based on the two one-sided tests\nprocedure to determine whether the average values for the pharmacokinetic measures\ndetermined after administration of the T and R products were comparable. This approach is\ntermed average bioequivalence and involves the calculation of a 90% confidence interval for\nthe ratio of the averages (population geometric means) of the measures for the T and R\nproducts. To establish BE, the calculated confidence interval should fall within a BE limit,\nusually 80-125% for the ratio of the product averages.2 In addition to this general approach,\nthe 1992 guidance provided specific recommendations for (1) logarithmic transformation of\npharmacokinetic data, (2) methods to evaluate sequence effects, and (3) methods to evaluate\noutlier data.\nAlthough average BE is recommended for a comparison of BA measures in most BE studies,\nthis guidance describes two new approaches, termed population and individual\nbioequivalence. These new approaches may be useful, in some instances, for analyzing\nin vitro and in vivo BE studies.3 The average BE approach focuses only on the comparison of\npopulation averages of a BE measure of interest and not on the variances of the measure for the\n2\nFor a broad range of drugs, a BE limit of 80 to 125% for the ratio of the product averages has been adopted\nfor use of an average BE criterion. Generally, the BE limit of 80 to 125% is based on a clinical judgment that a test\nproduct with BA measures outside this range should be denied market access.\n3\nFor additional recommendations on in vivo studies, see the FDA guidance for industry on Bioavailability\nand Bioequivalence Studies for Orally Administered Drug Products C General Considerations. Additional\nrecommendations on in vitro studies will be provided in an FDA guidance for industry on Bioavailability and\nBioequivalence Studies for Nasal Aerosols and Nasal Sprays for Local Action, when finalized.\n2\nT and R products. The average BE method does not assess a subject-by-formulation\ninteraction variance, that is, the variation in the average T and R difference among individuals.\nIn contrast, population and individual BE approaches include comparisons of both averages and\nvariances of the measure. The population BE approach assesses total variability of the measure\nin the population. The individual BE approach assesses within-subject variability for the T and\nR products, as well as the subject-by-formulation interaction.\nIII. STATISTICAL MODEL\nStatistical analyses of BE data are typically based on a statistical model for the logarithm of the BA\nmeasures (e.g., AUC and Cmax). The model is a mixed-effects or two-stage linear model. Each\nsubject, j, theoretically provides a mean for the log-transformed BA measure for each formulation, m\nTj\nand m for the T and R formulations, respectively. The model assumes that these subject-specific\nRj\nmeans come from a distribution with population means m and m , and between-subject variances s 2\nT R BT\nand s 2, respectively. The model allows for a correlation, r , between m and m . The subject-by-\nBR Tj Rj\nformulation interaction variance component (Schall and Luus 1993), s 2, is related to these parameters\nD\nas follows:\ns 2 = variance of (m - m )\nD Tj Rj\n= (s - s )2 + 2 (1-r )s s Equation 1\nBT BR BT BR\nFor a given subject, the observed data for the log-transformed BA measure are assumed to be\nindependent observations from distributions with means m and m , and within-subject variances s 2\nTj Rj WT\nand s 2. The total variances for each formulation are defined as the sum of the within- and between-\nWR\nsubject components (i.e., s 2 = s 2 + s 2 and s 2 = s 2 + s 2). For analysis of crossover\nTT WT BT TR WR BR\nstudies, the means are given additional structure by the inclusion of period and sequence effect terms.\nIV. STATISTICAL APPROACHES FOR BIOEQUIVALENCE\nThe general structure of a BE criterion is that a function (Q ) of population measures should be\ndemonstrated to be no greater than a specified value (q ). Using the terminology of statistical hypothesis\ntesting, this is accomplished by testing the hypothesis H: Q >q versus H : Q #q at a desired level of\n0 A\nsignificance, often 5%. Rejection of the null hypothesis H (i.e., demonstrating that the estimate of Q is\n0\nstatistically significantly less than )q results in a conclusion of BE. The choice of Q and q differs in\naverage, population, and individual BE approaches.\nA general objective in assessing BE is to compare the log-transformed BA measure after administration\nof the T and R products. As detailed in Appendix A, population and individual approaches are based\non the comparison of an expected squared distance between the T and R formulations to the expected\n3\nsquared distance between two administrations of the R formulation. An acceptable T formulation is one\nwhere the T-R distance is not substantially greater than the R-R distance. In both population and\nindividual BE approaches, this comparison appears as a comparison to the reference variance, which is\nreferred to as scaling to the reference variability.\nPopulation and individual BE approaches, but not the average BE approach, allow two types of scaling:\nreference-scaling and constant-scaling. Reference-scaling means that the criterion used is scaled to the\nvariability of the R product, which effectively widens the BE limit for more variable reference products.\nAlthough generally sufficient, use of reference-scaling alone could unnecessarily narrow the BE limit for\ndrugs and/or drug products that have low variability but a wide therapeutic range. This guidance,\ntherefore, recommends mixed-scaling for the population and individual BE approaches (section IV.B\nand C). With mixed scaling, the reference-scaled form of the criterion should be used if the reference\nproduct is highly variable; otherwise, the constant-scaled form should be used.\nA. Average Bioequivalence\nThe following criterion is recommended for average BE:\n(m - m ) 2 # q 2 Equation 2\nT R A\nwhere\nm = population average response of the log-transformed measure for the T\nT\nformulation\nm = population average response of the log-transformed measure for the R\nR\nformulation\nas defined in section III above.\n4\nThis criterion is equivalent to:\n-q # (m - m ) # q Equation 3\nA T R A\nand, usually, q = ln(1.25).\nA\nB. Population Bioequivalence\nThe following mixed-scaling approach is recommended for population BE (i.e., use the\nreference-scaled method if the estimate of s > s and the constant-scaled method if the\nTR T0\nestimate of s # s ).\nTR T0\nThe recommended criteria are:\n! Reference-Scaled:\n(m - m )2 + (s 2 - s 2)\nT R TT TR\n-------------------------------- # q Equation 4\np\ns 2\nTR\nor\n! Constant-Scaled:\n(m - m )2 + (s 2 - s 2)\nT R TT TR\n-------------------------------- # q Equation 5\np\ns 2\nT0\nwhere:\nm = population average response of the log-transformed measure\nT\nfor the T formulation\nm = population average response of the log-transformed measure\nR\nfor the R formulation\ns 2 = total variance (i.e., sum of within- and between-subject\nTT\nvariances) of the T formulation\ns 2 = total variance (i.e., sum of within- and between-subject\nTR\nvariances) of the R formulation\ns 2 = specified constant total variance\nT0\nq = BE limit\np\n5\nEquations 4 and 5 represent an aggregate approach where a single criterion on the left-hand\nside of the equation encompasses two major components: (1) the difference between the T and\nR population averages (m - m ), and (2) the difference between the T and R total variances\nT R\n(s 2 - s 2). This aggregate measure is scaled to the total variance of the R product or to a\nTT TR\nconstant value (s 2, a standard that relates to a limit for the total variance), whichever is\nT0\ngreater.\nThe specification of both s and q relies on the establishment of standards. The generation of\nT0 P\nthese standards is discussed in Appendix A. When the population BE approach is used, in\naddition to meeting the BE limit based on confidence bounds, the point estimate of the\ngeometric test/reference mean should fall within 80-125%.\nC. Individual Bioequivalence\nThe following mixed-scaling approach is one approach for individual BE (i.e., use the reference-\nscaled method if the estimate of s > s , and the constant-scaled method if the estimate of\nWR W0\ns # s ). Also see section VII.D, Discontinuity, for further discussion.\nWR W0\nThe recommended criteria are:\n!

This aggregate\nWT WR\nmeasure is scaled to the within-subject variance of the R product or to a constant value (s 2, a\nW0\nstandard that relates to a limit for the within-subject variance), whichever is greater.\nThe specification of both s and q relies on the establishment of standards. The generation of\nW0 I\nthese standards is discussed in Appendix A. When the individual BE approach is used, in\naddition to meeting the BE limit based on confidence bounds, the point estimate of the\ngeometric test/reference mean ratio should fall within 80-125%.\nV. STUDY DESIGN\nA. Experimental Design\n1. Nonreplicated Designs\nA conventional nonreplicated design, such as the standard two-formulation, two-period,\ntwo-sequence crossover design, can be used to generate data where an average or\npopulation approach is chosen for BE comparisons. Under certain circumstances,\nparallel designs can also be used.\n2. Replicated Crossover Designs\nReplicated crossover designs can be used irrespective of which approach is selected to\nestablish BE, although they are not necessary when an average or population approach\nis used. Replicated crossover designs are critical when an individual BE approach is\nused to allow estimation of within-subject variances for the T and R measures and the\nsubject-by-formulation interaction variance component. The following four-period,\ntwo-sequence, two-formulation design is recommended for replicated BE studies (see\nAppendix B for further discussion of replicated crossover designs).\n7\nPeriod\n1 2 3 4\n1 T R T R\nSequence\n2 R T R T\nFor this design, the same lots of the T and R formulations should be used for the\nreplicated administration. Each period should be separated by an adequate washout\nperiod.\nOther replicated crossover designs are possible. For example, a three-period design,\nas shown below, could be used.\nPeriod\n1 2 3\n1 T R T\nSequence\n2 R T R\nA greater number of subjects would be encouraged for the three-period design\ncompared to the recommended four-period design to achieve the same statistical power\nto conclude BE (see Appendix C).\nB. Sample Size and Dropouts\nA minimum number of 12 evaluable subjects should be included in any BE study. When an\naverage BE approach is selected using either nonreplicated or replicated designs, methods\nappropriate to the study design should be used to estimate sample sizes. The number of\nsubjects for BE studies based on either the population or individual BE approach can be\nestimated by simulation if analytical approaches for estimation are not available. Further\ninformation on sample size is provided in Appendix C.\nSponsors should enter a sufficient number of subjects in the study to allow for dropouts.\nBecause replacement of subjects during the study could complicate the statistical model and\nanalysis, dropouts generally should not be replaced. Sponsors who wish to replace dropouts\nduring the study should indicate this intention in the protocol. The protocol should also state\n8\nwhether samples from replacement subjects, if not used, will be assayed. If the dropout rate is\nhigh and sponsors wish to add more subjects, a modification of the statistical analysis may be\nrecommended. Additional subjects should not be included after data analysis unless the trial\nwas designed from the beginning as a sequential or group sequential design.\nVI. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nThe following sections provide recommendations on statistical methodology for assessment of average,\npopulation, and individual BE.\nA. Logarithmic Transformation\n1. General Procedures\nThis guidance recommends that BE measures (e.g., AUC and Cmax) be log-\ntransformed using either common logarithms to the base 10 or natural logarithms (see\nAppendix D). The choice of common or natural logs should be consistent and should\nbe stated in the study report. The limited sample size in a typical BE study precludes a\nreliable determination of the distribution of the data set. Sponsors and/or applicants are\nnot encouraged to test for normality of error distribution after log-transformation, nor\nshould they use normality of error distribution as a reason for carrying out the statistical\nanalysis on the original scale. Justification should be provided if sponsors or applicants\nbelieve that their BE study data should be statistically analyzed on the original rather\nthan on the log scale.\n2. Presentation of Data\nThe drug concentration in biological fluid determined at each sampling time point should\nbe furnished on the original scale for each subject participating in the study. The\npharmacokinetic measures of systemic exposure should also be furnished on the original\nscale. The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for each variable\nshould be computed and tabulated in the final report.\nIn addition to the arithmetic mean and associated standard deviation (or coefficient of\nvariation) for the T and R products, geometric means (antilog of the means of the logs)\nshould be calculated for selected BE measures. To facilitate BE comparisons, the\nmeasures for each individual should be displayed in parallel for the formulations tested.\nIn particular, for each BE measure the ratio of the individual geometric mean of the T\nproduct to the individual geometric mean of the R product should be tabulated side by\nside for each subject. The summary tables should indicate in which sequence each\n9\nsubject received the product.\nB. Data Analysis\n1. Average Bioequivalence\na. Overview\nParametric (normal-theory) methods are recommended for the analysis of log-\ntransformed BE measures. For average BE using the criterion stated in\nequations 2 or 3 (section III.A), the general approach is to construct a 90%\nconfidence interval for the quantity m -m and to reach a conclusion of average\nT R\nBE if this confidence interval is contained in the interval [-q , q ]. Due to the\nA A\nnature of normal-theory confidence intervals, this is equivalent to carrying out\ntwo one-sided tests of hypothesis at the 5% level of significance (Schuirmann\n1987).\nThe 90% confidence interval for the difference in the means of the log-\ntransformed data should be calculated using methods appropriate to the\nexperimental design. The antilogs of the confidence limits obtained constitute\nthe 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the geometric means between the T\nand R products.\nb. Nonreplicated Crossover Designs\nFor nonreplicated crossover designs, this guidance recommends parametric\n(normal-theory) procedures to analyze log-transformed BA measures. General\nlinear model procedures available in PROC GLM in SAS or equivalent\nsoftware are preferred, although linear mixed-effects model procedures can also\nbe indicated for analysis of nonreplicated crossover studies.\nFor example, for a conventional two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence (2 x\n2) randomized crossover design, the statistical model typically includes factors\naccounting for the following sources of variation: sequence, subjects nested in\nsequences, period, and treatment. The Estimate statement in SAS PROC\nGLM, or equivalent statement in other software, should be used to obtain\nestimates for the adjusted differences between treatment means and the\nstandard error associated with these differences.\nc. Replicated Crossover Designs\n10\nLinear mixed-effects model procedures, available in PROC MIXED in SAS or\nequivalent software, should be used for the analysis of replicated crossover\nstudies for average BE. Appendix E includes an example of SAS program\nstatements.\nd. Parallel Designs\nFor parallel designs, the confidence interval for the difference of means in the\nlog scale can be computed using the total between-subject variance. As in the\nanalysis for replicated designs (section VI. B.1.b), equal variances should not\nbe assumed.\n2. Population Bioequivalence\na. Overview\nAnalysis of BE data using the population approach (section IV.B) should focus\nfirst on estimation of the mean difference between the T and R for the log-\ntransformed BA measure and estimation of the total variance for each of the\ntwo formulations. This can be done using relatively simple unbiased estimators\nsuch as the method of moments (MM) (Chinchilli 1996, and Chinchilli and\nEsinhart 1996). After the estimation of the mean difference and the variances\nhas been completed, a 95% upper confidence bound for the population BE\ncriterion can be obtained, or equivalently a 95% upper confidence bound for a\nlinearized form of the population BE criterion can be obtained. Population BE\nshould be considered to be established for a particular log-transformed BA\nmeasure if the 95% upper confidence bound for the criterion is less than or\nequal to the BE limit, q , or equivalently if the 95% upper confidence bound for\nP\nthe linearized criterion is less than or equal to 0.\nTo obtain the 95% upper confidence bound of the criterion, intervals based on\nvalidated approaches can be used. Validation approaches should be reviewed\nwith appropriate staff in CDER. Appendix F includes an example of upper\nconfidence bound determination using a population BE approach.\nb. Nonreplicated Crossover Designs\nFor nonreplicated crossover studies, any available method (e.g., SAS PROC\nGLM or equivalent software) can be used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the\nmean difference in log-transformed BA measures between the T and R\nproducts. The total variance for each formulation should be estimated by the\n11\nusual sample variance, computed separately in each sequence and then pooled\nacross sequences.\nc. Replicated Crossover Designs\nFor replicated crossover studies, the approach should be the same as for\nnonreplicated crossover designs, but care should be taken to obtain proper\nestimates of the total variances. One approach is to estimate the within- and\nbetween-subject components separately, as for individual BE (see section\nVI.B.3), and then sum them to obtain the total variance. The method for the\nupper confidence bound should be consistent with the method used for\nestimating the variances.\nd. Parallel Designs\nThe estimate of the means and variances from parallel designs should be the\nsame as for nonreplicated crossover designs. The method for the upper\nconfidence bound should be modified to reflect independent rather than paired\nsamples and to allow for unequal variances.\n3. Individual Bioequivalence\nAnalysis of BE data using an individual BE approach (section IV.C) should focus on\nestimation of the mean difference between T and R for the log-transformed BA\nmeasure, the subject-by-formulation interaction variance, and the within-subject\nvariance for each of the two formulations. For this purpose, we recommend the MM\napproach.\nTo obtain the 95% upper confidence bound of a linearized form of the individual BE\ncriterion, intervals based on validated approaches can be used. An example is\ndescribed in Appendix G. After the estimation of the mean difference and the variances\nhas been completed, a 95% upper confidence bound for the individual BE criterion can\nbe obtained, or equivalently a 95% upper confidence bound for a linearized form of the\nindividual BE criterion can be obtained. Individual BE should be considered to be\nestablished for a particular log-transformed BA measure if the 95% upper confidence\nbound for the criterion is less than or equal to the BE limit, q , or equivalently if the 95%\nI\nupper confidence bound for the linearized criterion is less than or equal to 0.\nThe restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method may be useful to estimate mean\ndifferences and variances when subjects with some missing data are included in the\nstatistical analysis. A key distinction between the REML and MM methods relates to\n12\ndifferences in estimating variance terms and is further discussed in Appendix H.\nSponsors considering alternative methods to REML or MM are encouraged to discuss\ntheir approaches with appropriate CDER review staff prior to submitting their\napplications.\nVII. MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES\nA. Studies in Multiple Groups\nIf a crossover study is carried out in two or more groups of subjects (e.g., if for logistical\nreasons only a limited number of subjects can be studied at one time), the statistical model\nshould be modified to reflect the multigroup nature of the study. In particular, the model should\nreflect the fact that the periods for the first group are different from the periods for the second\ngroup. This applies to all of the approaches (average, population, and individual BE) described\nin this guidance.\nIf the study is carried out in two or more groups and those groups are studied at different clinical\nsites, or at the same site but greatly separated in time (months apart, for example), questions\nmay arise as to whether the results from the several groups should be combined in a single\nanalysis. Such cases should be discussed with the appropriate CDER review division.\nA sequential design, in which the decision to study a second group of subjects is based on the\nresults from the first group, calls for different statistical methods and is outside the scope of this\nguidance. Those wishing to use a sequential design should consult the appropriate CDER\nreview division.\nB. Carryover Effects\nUse of crossover designs for BE studies allows each subject to serve as his or her own control\nto improve the precision of the comparison. One of the assumptions underlying this principle is\nthat carryover effects (also called residual effects) are either absent (the response to a\nformulation administered in a particular period of the design is unaffected by formulations\nadministered in earlier periods) or equal for each formulation and preceding formulation. If\ncarryover effects are present in a crossover study and are not equal, the usual crossover\nestimate of m -m could be biased. One limitation of a conventional two-formulation, two-\nT R\nperiod, two-sequence crossover design is that the only statistical test available for the presence\nof unequal carryover effects is the sequence test in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the\ncrossover design. This is a between-subject test, which would be expected to have poor\ndiscriminating power in a typical BE study. Furthermore, if the possibility of unequal carryover\neffects cannot be ruled out, no unbiased estimate of m -m based on within-subject\nT R\n13\ncomparisons can be obtained with this design.\nFor replicated crossover studies, a within-subject test for unequal carryover effects can be\nobtained under certain assumptions. Typically only first-order carryover effects are considered\nof concern (i.e., the carryover effects, if they occur, only affect the response to the formulation\nadministered in the next period of the design). Under this assumption, consideration of\ncarryover effects could be more complicated for replicated crossover studies than for\nnonreplicated studies. The carryover effect could depend not only on the formulation that\npreceded the current period, but also on the formulation that is administered in the current\nperiod. This is called a direct-by-carryover interaction. The need to consider more than just\nsimple first-order carryover effects has been emphasized (Fleiss 1989). With a replicated\ncrossover design, a within-subject estimate of m -m unbiased by general first-order carryover\nT R\neffects can be obtained, but such an estimate could be imprecise, reducing the power of the\nstudy to conclude BE.\nIn most cases, for both replicated and nonreplicated crossover designs, the possibility of\nunequal carryover effects is considered unlikely in a BE study under the following circumstances:\n! It is a single-dose study.\n! The drug is not an endogenous entity.\n! More than an adequate washout period has been allowed between periods of the study\nand in the subsequent periods the predose biological matrix samples do not exhibit a\ndetectable drug level in any of the subjects.\n! The study meets all scientific criteria (e.g., it is based on an acceptable study protocol\nand it contains sufficient validated assay methodology).\nThe possibility of unequal carryover effects can also be discounted for multiple-dose studies\nand/or studies in patients, provided that the drug is not an endogenous entity and the studies\nmeet all scientific criteria as described above. Under all other circumstances, the sponsor or\napplicant could be asked to consider the possibility of unequal carryover effects, including a\ndirect-by-carryover interaction. If there is evidence of carryover effects, sponsors should\ndescribe their proposed approach in the study protocol, including statistical tests for the\npresence of such effects and procedures to be followed. Sponsors who suspect that carryover\neffects might be an issue may wish to conduct a BE study with parallel designs.\nC. Outlier Considerations\nOutlier data in BE studies are defined as subject data for one or more BA measures that are\n14\ndiscordant with corresponding data for that subject and/or for the rest of the subjects in a study.\nBecause BE studies are usually carried out as crossover studies, the most important type of\nsubject outlier is the within-subject outlier, where one subject or a few subjects differ notably\nfrom the rest of the subjects with respect to a within-subject T-R comparison. The existence of\na subject outlier with no protocol violations could indicate one of the following situations:\n1. Product Failure\nProduct failure could occur, for example, when a subject exhibits an unusually high or\nlow response to one or the other of the products because of a problem with the specific\ndosage unit administered. This could occur, for example, with a sustained and/or\ndelayed-release dosage form exhibiting dose dumping or a dosage unit with a coating\nthat inhibits dissolution.\n2. Subject-by-Formulation Interaction\nA subject-by-formulation interaction could occur when an individual is representative of\nsubjects present in the general population in low numbers, for whom the relative BA of\nthe two products is markedly different than for the majority of the population, and for\nwhom the two products are not bioequivalent, even though they might be bioequivalent\nin the majority of the population.\nIn the case of product failure, the unusual response could be present for either the T or R\nproduct. However, in the case of a subpopulation, even if the unusual response is observed on\nthe R product, there could still be concern for lack of interchangeability of the two products.\nFor these reasons, deletion of outlier values is generally discouraged, particularly for\nnonreplicated designs. With replicated crossover designs, the retest character of these designs\nshould indicate whether to delete an outlier value or not. Sponsors or applicants with these\ntypes of data sets may wish to review how to handle outliers with appropriate review staff.\nD. Discontinuity\nThe mixed-scaling approach has a discontinuity at the changeover point, s (individual BE\nW0\ncriterion) or s (population BE criterion), from constant- to reference-scaling. For example, if\nT0\nthe estimate of the within-subject standard deviation of the reference is just above the\nchangeover point, the confidence interval will be wider than just below. In this context, the\nconfidence interval could pass the predetermined BE limit if the estimate is just below the\nboundary and could fail if just above. This guidance recommends that sponsors applying the\nindividual BE approach may use either reference-scaling or constant-scaling at either side of the\nchangeover point. With this approach, the multiple testing inflates the type I error rate slightly,\nto approximately 6.5%, but only over a small interval of s (about 0.18-0.20).\nWR\n15\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, S., and W.W.

The recommended approach to establishing these\nW0 I\nstandards is described below.\nA. ss and ss\nT0 W0\nAs indicated in section IV, a general objective in assessing BE should be to compare the\ndifference in the BA log-measure of interest after the administration of the T and R formulations,\nT-R, with the difference in the same log-metric after two administrations of the R formulation,\nR-RN.\n1. Population Bioequivalence\nFor population BE, the comparisons of interest should be expressed in terms of the ratio\nof the expected squared difference between T and R (administered to different\nindividuals) and the expected squared difference between R and RN (administered to\ndifferent individuals), as shown below.\nE(T - R)2 = (m - m )2 + s 2 + s 2 Equation 8\nT R TT TR\nE(R - RN)2 = 2s 2 Equation 9\nTR\nE(T - R)2 (m - m )2 + s 2 + s 2\nT R TT TR\n------------- = -------------------------------\nEquation 10\nE(R - RN)2 2s 2\nTR\nThe population BE criterion in equation 4 (section IV.B.) is derived from equation 10,\nsuch that the criterion equals zero for two identical formulations. The square root of\nequation 10 yields the “population difference ratio” (PDR):\n21\n(m - m )2 + s 2 + s 2\nT R TT TR\nPDR = [ -------------------------------]2 Equation 11\n2s 2\nTR\nThe PDR is the square root of the ratio of the expected squared T-R difference\ncompared to the expected squared R-R' difference in the population. It should be\nnoted that the PDR is monotonically related to the population BE criterion (PBC)\ndescribed in equation 4 as follows:\nPDR = (PBC/2 + 1)2 Equation 12\nSponsors or applicants wishing to use the population BE approach should contact the\nAgency for further information on s .\nT0\n2. Individual Bioequivalence\nFor individual BE, the comparisons of interest should be expressed in terms of the ratio\nof the expected squared difference between T and R (administered to the same\nindividual) and the expected squared difference between R and RN (two administrations\nof R to the same individual), as shown below.\nE(T - R)2 = (m - m )2 + s 2 + s 2 + s 2 Equation 13\nT R D WT WR\nE(R - RN)2 = 2s 2 Equation 14\nWR\nE(T - R)2 (m - m )2 + s 2 + s 2 + s 2\nT R D WT WR\n------------- = ----------------------------------------\nEquation 15\nE(R - RN)2 2s 2\nWR\nThe individual BE criterion in equation 6 (section IV.C.) is derived from equation 15,\nsuch that the criterion equals zero for two identical formulations. The square root of\nequation 15 is the individual difference ratio (IDR):\n22\n(m - m )2 + s 2 + s 2 + s 2\nT R D WT WR\nIDR = [ ----------------------------------------]2 Equation 16\n2s 2\nWR\nThe IDR is the square root of the ratio of the expected squared T-R difference\ncompared to the expected squared R-R' difference within an individual. The IDR is\nmonotonically related to the individual BE criterion (IBC) described in equation 6 as\nfollows:\nIDR = (IBC/2 + 1)2 Equation 17\nThis guidance recommends that s = 0.2, based on the consideration of the maximum\nW0\nallowable IDR of 1.25.4\nB. qq and qq\nP I\nThe determination of q and q should be based on the consideration of average BE criterion\nP I\nand the addition of variance terms to the population and individual BE criterion, as expressed by\nthe formula below.\naverage BE limit + variance factor\nq = -----------------------------------------------\nvariance\n1. Population Bioequivalence\n(ln1.25)2 + e\nP\nq = -------------------------- Equation 18\nP\ns 2\nT0\nThe value of e for population BE is guided by the consideration of the variance term\nP\n(s 2 - s 2) added to the average BE criterion. Sponsors or applicants wishing to use\nTT TR\nthe population BE approach should contact the Agency for further information on e\nP\nand q .\nP\n4\nThe IDR upper bound of 1.25 is drawn from the currently used upper BE limit of 1.25 for the average BE\ncriterion.\n23\n2. Individual Bioequivalence\n(ln1.25)2 + e\nI\nq = ----------------------- Equation 19\nI\ns 2\nW0\nThe value of e for individual BE is guided by the consideration of the estimate of\nI\nsubject-by-formulation interaction (s ) as well as the difference in within-subject\nD\nvariability (s 2 - s 2) added to the average BE criterion. The recommended\nWT WR\nallowance for the variance term (s 2 - s 2) is 0.02. In addition, this guidance\nWT WR\nrecommends a s 2 allowance of 0.03. The magnitude of s is associated with the\nD D\npercentage of individuals whose average T to R ratios lie outside 0.8-1.25. It is\nestimated that if s = 0.1356, ~10% of the individuals would have their average ratios\nD\noutside 0.8-1.25, even if m - m = 0. When s = 0.1741, the probability is ~20%.\nT R D\nAccordingly, on the basis of consideration for both s and variability (s 2 - s 2) in\nD WT WR\nthe criterion, this guidance recommends that e = 0.05.\nI\n24\nAPPENDIX B\nChoice of Specific Replicated Crossover Designs\nAppendix B describes why FDA prefers replicated crossover designs with only two sequences, and\nwhy we recommend the specific designs described in section V.A of this guidance.\n1. Reasons Unrelated to Carryover Effects\nEach unique combination of sequence and period in a replicated crossover design can be called a cell of\nthe design. For example, the two-sequence, four-period design recommended in\nsection V.A.1 has 8 cells. The four-sequence, four-period design below has 16 cells.\nPeriod\n1 2 3 4\n1 T R R T\n2 R T T R\nSequence\n3 T T R R\n4 R R T T\nThe total number of degrees-of-freedom attributable to comparisons among the cells is just the number\nof cells minus one (unless there are cells with no observations).\nThe fixed effects that are usually included in the statistical analysis are sequence, period, and treatment\n(i.e., formulation). The number of degrees-of-freedom attributable to each fixed effect is generally equal\nto the number of levels of the effect, minus one. Thus, in the case of the two-sequence, four-period\ndesign recommended in section V.A.1, there would be 2-1=1 degree-of-freedom due to sequence, 4-\n1=3 degrees-of-freedom due to period, and 2-1=1 degree-of-freedom due to treatment, for a total of\n1+3+1=5 degrees-of-freedom due to the three fixed effects. Because these 5 degrees-of-freedom do\nnot account for all 7 degrees-of-freedom attributable to the eight cells of the design, the fixed effects\nmodel is not saturated. There could be some controversy as to whether a fixed effects model that\naccounts for more or all of the degrees-of-freedom due to cells (i.e., a more saturated fixed effects\nmodel) should be used. For example, an effect for sequence-by-treatment interaction might be included\nin addition to the three main effects — sequence, period, and treatment. Alternatively, a sequence-by-\n25\nperiod interaction effect might be included, which would fully saturate the fixed effects model.\nIf the replicated crossover design has only two sequences, use of only the three main effects (sequence,\nperiod, and treatment) in the fixed effects model or use of a more saturated model makes little difference\nto the results of the analysis, provided there are no missing observations and the study is carried out in\none group of subjects. The least squares estimate of m -m will be the same for the main effects model\nT R\nand for the saturated model. Also, the method of moments (MM) estimators of the variance terms in\nthe model used in some approaches to assessment of population and individual BE (see Appendix H),\nwhich represent within-sequence comparisons, are generally fully efficient regardless of whether the\nmain effects model or the saturated model is used.\nIf the replicated crossover design has more than two sequences, these advantages are no longer\npresent. Main effects models will generally produce different estimates of m -m than saturated models\nT R\n(unless the number of subjects in each sequence is equal), and there is no well-accepted basis for\nchoosing between these different estimates. Also, MM estimators of variance terms will be fully efficient\nonly for saturated models, while for main effects models fully efficient estimators would have to include\nsome between-sequence components, complicating the analysis. Thus, use of designs with only two\nsequences minimizes or avoids certain ambiguities due to the method of estimating variances or due to\nspecific choices of fixed effects to be included in the statistical model.\n2. Reasons Related to Carryover Effects\nOne of the reasons to use the four-sequence, four-period design described above is that it is thought to\nbe optimal if carryover effects are included in the model. Similarly, the two-sequence, three-period\ndesign\nPeriod\n1 2 3\n1 T R R\nSequence\n2 R T T\nis thought to be optimal among three-period replicated crossover designs. Both of these designs are\nstrongly balanced for carryover effects, meaning that each treatment is preceded by each other\ntreatment and itself an equal number of times.\nWith these designs, no efficiency is lost by including simple first-order carryover effects in the statistical\nmodel. However, if the possibility of carryover effects is to be considered in the statistical analysis of\nBE studies, the possibility of direct-by-carryover interaction should also be considered. If direct-by-\n26\ncarryover interaction is present in the statistical model, these favored designs are no longer optimal.\nIndeed, the TRR/RTT design does not permit an unbiased within-subject estimate of m -m in the\nT R\npresence of general direct-by-carryover interaction.\nThe issue of whether a purely main effects model or a more saturated model should be specified, as\ndescribed in the previous section, also is affected by possible carryover effects. If carryover effects,\nincluding direct-by-carryover interaction, are included in the statistical model, these effects will be\npartially confounded with sequence-by-treatment interaction in four-sequence or six-sequence\nreplicated crossover designs, but not in two-sequence designs.\nIn the case of the four-period and three-period designs recommended in section V.A.1, the estimate of\nm -m , adjusted for first-order carryover effects including direct-by-carryover interaction, is as efficient\nT R\nor more efficient than for any other two-treatment replicated crossover designs.\n3. Two-Period Replicated Crossover Designs\nFor the majority of drug products, two-period replicated crossover designs such as the Balaam design\n(which uses the sequences TR, RT, TT, and RR) should be avoided for individual BE because subjects\nin the TT or RR sequence do not provide any information on subject-by-formulation interaction.\nHowever, the Balaam design may be useful for particular drug products (e.g., a long half-life drug for\nwhich a two-period study would be feasible but a three- or more period study would not).\n27\nAPPENDIX C\nSample Size Determination\nSample sizes for average BE should be obtained using published formulas. Sample sizes for population\nand individual BE should be based on simulated data. The simulations should be conducted using a\ndefault situation allowing the two formulations to vary as much as 5% in average BA with equal\nvariances and certain magnitude of subject-by-formulation interaction. The study should have 80 or\n90% power to conclude BE between these two formulations. Sample size also depends on the\nmagnitude of variability and the design of the study.

This is because the studies are already\npowered for variance estimation and inference, and therefore, a constraint on the point\nestimate of D has little influence on the sample size for small values of D .\n31\nAPPENDIX D\nRationale for Logarithmic Transformation of Pharmacokinetic Data\nA. Clinical Rationale\nThe FDA Generic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended in 1991 that the primary comparison of\ninterest in a BE study is the ratio, rather than the difference, between average parameter data from the T\nand R formulations. Using logarithmic transformation, the general linear statistical model employed in\nthe analysis of BE data allows inferences about the difference between the two means on the log scale,\nwhich can then be retransformed into inferences about the ratio of the two averages (means or medians)\non the original scale. Logarithmic transformation thus achieves a general comparison based on the ratio\nrather than the differences.\nB. Pharmacokinetic Rationale\nWestlake observed that a multiplicative model is postulated for pharmacokinetic measures in BA/BE\nstudies (i.e., AUC and Cmax, but not Tmax) (Westlake 1973 and 1988). Assuming that elimination of\nthe drug is first-order and only occurs from the central compartment, the following equation holds after\nan extravascular route of administration:\nAUC = FD/CL Equation 20\n0-4\n= FD/(VK ) Equation 21\ne\nwhere F is the fraction absorbed, D is the administered dose, and FD is the amount of drug absorbed.\nCL is the clearance of a given subject that is the product of the apparent volume of distribution (V) and\nthe elimination rate constant (K ).5 The use of AUC as a measure of the amount of drug absorbed\ne\n5 Note that a more general equation can be written for any multicompartmental model as\nAUC = FD/V l Equation 22\n0-(cid:31) dß n\nwhere V is the volume of distribution relating drug concentration in plasma or blood to the amount of drug in the\ndß\nbody during the terminal exponential phase, and l is the terminal slope of the concentration-time curve.\nn\n32\ninvolves a multiplicative term (CL) that might be regarded as a function of the subject. For this reason,\nWestlake contends that the subject effect is not additive if the data are analyzed on the original scale of\nmeasurement.\nLogarithmic transformation of the AUC data will bring the CL (VK ) term into the following equation in\ne\nan additive fashion:\nlnAUC = ln F + ln D - ln V - ln K Equation 23\n0-4 e\nSimilar arguments were given for Cmax. The following equation applies for a drug exhibiting one\ncompartmental characteristics:\nC = (FD/V) x e-ke*Tmax Equation 24\nmax\nwhere again F, D and V are introduced into the model in a multiplicative manner. However, after\nlogarithmic transformation, the equation becomes\nlnC = ln F + ln D - ln V - KT Equation 25\nmax e max\nThus, log transformation of the Cmax data also results in the additive treatment of the V term.\n33\nAPPENDIX E\nSAS Program Statements for Average BE Analysis of\nReplicated Crossover Studies\nThe following illustrates an example of program statements to run the average BE analysis using\nPROC MIXED in SAS version 6.12, with SEQ, SUBJ, PER, and TRT identifying sequence,\nsubject, period, and treatment variables, respectively, and Y denoting the response measure (e.g.,\nlog(AUC), log(Cmax)) being analyzed:\nPROC MIXED;\nCLASSES SEQ SUBJ PER TRT;\nMODEL Y = SEQ PER TRT/ DDFM=SATTERTH;\nRANDOM TRT/TYPE=FA0(2) SUB=SUBJ G;\nREPEATED/GRP=TRT SUB=SUBJ;\nESTIMATE 'T vs. R' TRT 1 -1/CL ALPHA=0.1;\nThe Estimate statement assumes that the code for the T formulation precedes the code for the R\nformulation in sort order (this would be the case, for example, if T were coded as 1 and R were\ncoded as 2). If the R code precedes the T code in sort order, the coefficients in the Estimate\nstatement would be changed to -1 1.\nIn the Random statement, TYPE=FA0(2) could possibly be replaced by TYPE=CSH. This\nguidance recommends that TYPE=UN not be used, as it could result in an invalid (i.e., not non-\nnegative definite) estimated covariance matrix.\nAdditions and modifications to these statements can be made if the study is carried out in more than\none group of subjects.\n34\nAPPENDIX F\nMethod for Statistical Test of Population Bioequivalence Criterion\nFour-Period Crossover Designs\nAppendix F describes a method for using the population BE criterion (see section IV.B, equations 4\nand 5). The procedure involves the computation of a test statistic that is either positive (does not\nconclude population BE) or negative (concludes population BE).\nConsider the following statistical model which assumes a four-period design with equal replication of\nT and R in each of s sequences with an assumption of no (or equal) carryover effects (equal\ncarryovers go into the period effects)\nY = mg+ d+ e+\nijkl kiklijkijkl\nwhere i=1,Ks indicates sequence, j =1,Kn indicates subject within sequence i, k = R, T\ni\nindicates treatment, l =1, 2 indicates replicate on treatment k for subjects within sequence i. Y is\nijkl\nthe response of replicate l on treatment k for subject j in sequence i, g represents the fixed\nikl\neffect of replicate l on treatment k in sequence i, d is the random subject effect for subject j in\nijk\nsequence i on treatment k, and e is the random error for subject j within sequence i on\nijkl\nreplicate l of treatment k.

The various nuisance\nparameters are estimated in this model, but the focus is on the parameters needed for population BE.\nIn some designs, the sequence and period effects can be estimated through a reparametrization of\nthe nuisance effects.\nThis model definition can be extended to other crossover designs.\nLinearized Criteria (from section IV.

If the upper bound is positive, do\nnot conclude individual BE.\nThis guidance recommends that sponsors use either reference-scaling or constant-scaling at the\nchangeover point (see section VII.D, Discontinuity). To test for individual BE, compute the 95%\nupper confidence bounds of both reference-scaled and constant-scaled linearized criteria. The\nprocedure for computing these confidence bounds is described above. If the upper bound of either\ncriterion is negative or zero (eitherH or H ), conclude individual BE. If the upper bounds of\nh h\n1 2\nboth criteria are positive, do not conclude individual BE.\n44\nAPPENDIX H\nVariance Estimation\nRelatively simple unbiased estimators, the method of moments (MM) or the restricted maximum\nlikelihood (REML) method, can be used to estimate the mean and variance parameters in the\nindividual BE approach. A key distinction between the REML and MM methods relates to\ndifferences in estimating variance terms. The REML method estimates each of the three variances,\ns 2 , s 2 , s 2 , separately and then combines them in the individual BE criterion. The REML\nD WR WT\nestimate of s 2 is found from estimates of s 2 , s 2 , and the correlation, r . The MM approach\nD BR BT\nis to estimate the sum of the variance terms in the numerator of the criterion, s 2 + s 2 - s 2,\nD WT WR\nand does not necessarily estimate each component separately. One consequence of this difference\nis that the MM estimator of s 2 is unbiased but could be negative. The REML approach can also\nD\nlead to negative estimates, but if the covariance matrix of the random effects is forced to be a\nproper covariance matrix, the estimate of s 2 can be made to be non-negative. This forced non-\nD\nnegativity has the effect of making the estimate positively biased and introduces a small amount of\nconservatism to the confidence bound. The REML method can be used in special cases (e.g., when\nsubstantial missing data are present). In addition, the MM approaches have not yet been adapted\nto models that allow assessment of carryover effects.\n45"}

Twenty-three patients with RA (19 women, mean age 52.7 ± 12.6 yrs, mean disease\nduration 10.1 ± 8.6 yrs) were prospectively enrolled. All patients were beginning therapy with\nrituximab because of disease activity despite therapy with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic\ndrugs and tumor necrosis factor-blocking agents. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory, and\nvolumetric PDUS examination at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Ten centers participated in the\nstudy. Four centers recruited the patients and performed the volumetric acquisitions of PDUS\nimages, while the remaining 6 centers assessed the PDUS volumes, blinded to the identity of patients\nand date of the visits. The most symptomatic hand and foot were scored for B-mode synovitis,\nsynovial PD signal, and bone erosions. The repeatability of the volumetric PDUS assessment was\ninvestigated.\nResults.An overall improvement in clinical and PDUS measurements was found at the followup\nassessments. The mean indexes for synovial PD signal and bone erosions and the number of sites\nwith abnormalities decreased significantly throughout the followup (p < 0.05). The intraacquisition,\nintrareader reliability was excellent for all PDUS measurements (intraclass correlation coefficients\n> 0.9).\nConclusion. The results of our pilot study suggest that volumetric PDUS can be responsive and\nrepeatable in multicenter cohort studies of RA. This technique may minimize assessment biases and\nreduce acquisition variability in open-label and observational studies.

Objective.To assess 5-year safety, tolerability, and efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) abatacept (ABA)\nin methotrexate (MTX)-refractory patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nMethods. The Abatacept Comparison of sub[QU]cutaneous versus intravenous in Inadequate\nResponders to methotrexatE (ACQUIRE) phase IIIb, randomized, double-dummy, multinational trial\ncompared efficacy and safety of SC and intravenous (IV) ABA in patients with RA.
